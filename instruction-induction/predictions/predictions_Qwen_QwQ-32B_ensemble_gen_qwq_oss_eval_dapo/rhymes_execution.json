The user provided a set of input-output pairs and wants me to figure out the instruction that was given to the friend . So the task is to reverse-engineer what the instruction must have been based on these examples. Let me look at the pairs again:\n\nInput: examination → Output: celebration Input: so → Output: toe\nInput: site → Output: height\nInput: shoe → Output: you\nInput: situation → Output : generation\n\nHmm, I need to find a pattern or rule that transforms each input word into the corresponding output word. Let's start by comparing each input and output side by side.\n\nStarting with \"examination\" to \" celebration\". Let's see the letters. Maybe it's about taking certain letters from the input to form the output? Let me check the letters:\n\nExamination: E, X, A, M, I, N, A, T, I, O, N Celebration: C, E, L, E, B, R , A, T, I, O, N\n\nHmm, not sure . Maybe the vowels are being changed? Let's see vowels in examination: E, A, I, A, I, O. In celebration: E, E, E, A, I, O. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's about removing some letters or rearranging? Not obvious.\n\nNext pair: \"so\" to \"toe\". The input is two letters, output is three. Adding a letter? The input letters are S and O. Output has T, O, E . So maybe replacing the S with T and adding an E? Not sure yet.\n\nThird pair: site → height. Site is S, I, T, E. Height is H, E , I, G, H, T. So the output has a new H at the beginning, an E, I, G, H, T . Hmm. The input letters are S, I, T, E. The output has H, E, I, G, H, T. So maybe replacing the S with H and adding a G? Not sure.\n\nFourth pair: shoe → you. Shoe is S, H , O, E. Output is Y, O, U. So the input letters are S, H, O, E. The output is Y , O, U. So maybe removing the S and H and replacing them with Y? But how?\n\nFifth pair: situation → generation. Situation: S, I, T, U, A, T, I , O, N. Generation: G, E, N, E, R, A, T, I, O, N. So the output starts with G instead of S, and has an E, N, E , R, A, T, I, O, N. Let's see , replacing the S with G, adding an E and N and R? The input has S at start, and the output has G. So it 's replacing the first letter S with G? But in the first example, examination starts with E, and the output starts with C. So that's inconsistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about taking the last few letters and adding something? Let me think of another approach. Maybe the instruction is to take the input word and find another word that rh ymes with it? Let's check:\n\nExamination rhymes with celebration? They both end with -ation, so yes, they rhyme. \"So\" rhymes with \"toe\", yes. \"Site\" rh ymes with \"height\" - both have the /aɪt/ sound, so yes, they rhyme. \"Shoe\" and \"you\" both end with /uː/, so yes, they rhyme. \"Situation\" and \"generation\" both end with -ation, so yes, they rhyme. So the pattern is that each output word rhymes with the input word. So the instruction must be to \"Find a word that rhymes with the input word.\" That seems to fit all the examples. The instruction is likely: \"Give a word that rhymes with the input word.\" Or maybe: \"Replace the word with a rhyming word .\" Let me double-check each pair again to confirm:\n\n1. Examination → celebration: yes, they rhyme (both -ation)\n2. so → toe: yes, /soʊ/ and /toʊ/\n3. site → height: /saɪt/ and /haɪt/ rhyme\n4. shoe → you: /ʃuː/ and /juː/ rhyme\n5. situation → generation: both end with -ation, so yes.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. The instruction must have been to provide a word that rhymes with the given input word. Therefore, the answer is that the instruction was to find a word that rhymes with each input. The instruction could be phrased as \"Provide a word that rhymes with the given word\" or \"Give a rhyming word for the input.\"\n</think> The instruction is: **\"Provide a word that rhymes with the input word.\"**\n\n### Explanation:\nEach output word rhymes with the corresponding input word:\n- **"
