Input: panda, vegetable, designer, lizard, taxi, monkey, octopus → Output: monkey, panda, lizard, octopus  \n2. Input : helicopter, dolphin, photographer, hippo, fly, tortoise → Output: dolphin, tortoise, hippo, fly  \n3. Input : jellyfish, zebra, cat, sausage, onion → Output: cat, zebra, jellyfish  \n4. Input : nurse, lion , cat, yoghurt, tortoise → Output: lion, cat , tortoise  \n5. Input : bee, butterfly, horse, cookie , teacher, hippo → Output: butterfly, horse, bee, hippo  \n\nHmm. Let's see. The outputs are subsets of the inputs, but not all of them. So the instruction probably involves selecting certain elements from the input list that meet some criteria. Let's analyze each case.\n\nLooking at the first output: the original input has 7 elements, and the output is 4. The output includes \"monkey\", which isn't in the input except for the second input. Wait, no—the first input is \"panda, vegetable, designer, lizard, taxi, monkey, octopus\". So the output includes monkey, panda, lizard, octopus. The words excluded are vegetable, designer, taxi.\n\nWhat's common between those four words? Let me think. Monkey is an animal, panda is an animal, lizard is an animal, octopus is an animal. So maybe the instruction is to select animals? But wait, the second input includes \"dolphin\" (animal), \"tortoise\" (animal), \"hippo\" (animal), \"fly\" (which can be an insect, but also a verb or noun like the fly animal). Hmm. The second output is dolphin, tortoise, hippo, fly. All of these are animals. Fly as in the insect. So that works. The second input's excluded words are helicopter (object), photographer (profession), so maybe the instruction is to select animal names. Let's check the third input. Third input: jellyfish, zebra, cat, sausage, onion. The output is cat, zebra, jellyfish. So sausage and onion are excluded. Those are non-animals. So that fits.\n\nFourth input: nurse (profession), lion (animal), cat (animal), yoghurt (food), tortoise (animal). The output is lion, cat, tortoise. Excluded are nurse and yoghurt. So again, selecting animals.\n\nFifth input: bee (animal), butterfly (animal), horse (animal), cookie (food), teacher (profession), hippo (animal). Output is butterfly, horse, bee, hippo. Excluded are cookie and teacher. So all outputs are animals. So perhaps the instruction is to select animal names? But let's check again to see if there are any exceptions or other patterns.\n\nWait, but what about the word \"jellyfish\"? That's an animal, yes. \"Fly\" as an insect is an animal. So all outputs are animals. However, looking at the second input's output includes \"fly\", which is an insect, which is an animal, but \"fly\" can also be a verb or noun like the fly (the insect). So that's okay. So the instruction could be to select all animal nouns from the input list. But let's check if there are any words that might be considered animals but were excluded. For example, in the first input, \"vegetable\" is not an animal. \"Designer\" is a profession. \"Taxi\" is a vehicle. So the output includes only the animals. Similarly, the second input's excluded words are non-animals. But wait, in the first input, \"taxi\" is excluded. But how do we determine which words are animals? It depends on the context and the friend's knowledge. But maybe there's another layer here.\n\nWait, let's check if any of the outputs include words that are not animals. For example, in the second input, \"fly\" is an insect, which is an animal, but \"fly\" can also be a verb or noun like the fly (the insect). So that's okay. Similarly, \"jellyfish\" is an animal. So I think that's the pattern. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to exclude professions, objects, or non-living things.\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. For example, maybe it's about letters in the words? Let's see. Take the first input: \"panda\" (contains 'a', 'n', 'd', 'a'), \"vegetable\" (v, e, g, e, t, a, b, l, e), \"designer\" (d, e, s, i, g, n, e, r), \"lizard\" (l, i, z, a, r, d), \"taxi\" (t, a, x, i), \"monkey\" (m, o, n, k, e, y), \"octopus\" (o, c, t, o, p, u, s). The output includes monkey, panda, lizard, octopus. These words have certain letters. But maybe it's not letters. Alternatively, maybe the number of letters? Let's see:\n\nFirst output words: monkey (6 letters), panda (5), lizard (6), octopus (8). So varying lengths. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first letter? M, P, L, O. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are all animals, which seems to fit. Let's see if any of the outputs include non-animals. Let's check the outputs again. First output: monkey, panda, lizard, octopus. The first letters are M, P, L, O. Not a pattern. Second output: D, T, H, F. Third: C, Z, J. Fourth: L, C, T. Fifth: B, H, B, H. No obvious pattern. So the only common factor is that all are animals. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all words that can be found in the animal kingdom. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all words that start with vowels or consonants, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of legs? Like, animals with four legs or something? But monkey has four legs, panda has four, lizard has four, octopus has none. So that doesn't fit. Or maybe they are all vertebrates? Octopus is invertebrate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to select all words that are not professions. For example, \"designer\", \"photographer\", \"nurse\", \"teacher\" are professions. So the outputs exclude those. But in the first input, \"taxi\" is a vehicle, so it's excluded. So maybe the instruction is to exclude professions, vehicles, and other non-living entities. But that seems too vague.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any exceptions. For example, the word \"jellyfish\" is sometimes considered a fish, but technically it's a marine animal. But in common language, it's considered an animal. Similarly, \"octopus\" is a sea creature. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all words that start with a consonant. But then sausage and onion start with consonants, so that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all words that are not food. But the outputs include no food words. But no, that's just the same as selecting animals.</think> The instruction is: \"From the given list of words, select the words that represent animals.\"\n\nSo the final instruction is: \"Select the words from the list that represent"

 \nBut wait, \"scarf\" is in the input but not in the output.  \nSo maybe it's not just animals.  \nLet me check other pairs.  \nSo \"white\" is excluded.  \nThe output items are all animals again.  \n\"Swan\" is an animal, \"hippo\", \"fly\".  \nSo maybe the instruction is to select all animals from the list?  \nBut in the first input, \"pancake\", \"car\", \"scarf\" are not animals.  \nThe output includes chicken, whale, tortoise, frog which are all animals .  \nSo maybe the instruction is to filter out non-animal words.  \nBut wait, let's check the third input:  \nThose are all animals.  \n\"Train\" and \"yellow\" are excluded.  \nSo that fits.  \nAll animals.  \n\"Sandwich\", \"scarf\", \"jacket\" are excluded.  \nSo \"glove\", \"orange\", \"belt\" are excluded.  \nSo in all cases, the output consists of animal words from the input.  \nBut wait, \"fly\" is both an animal (insect) and a verb.  \nBut in the second input, \"fly\" is included in the output.  \nSimilarly, in the fifth input, \"fly\" is part of the output .  \nSo maybe the instruction is to list all the animals in the input.  \nBut let 's check the order of the outputs.  \nThe outputs don't follow the order of the input.  \nThe original input had them in a different order.  \nSo the order in the output is different.  \nSo the instruction must be to sort them in some way.  \nLet's check if the output is sorted alphabetically.  \nAlphabetical order would be chicken, frog, tortoise, whale.  \nBut the output is chicken, whale, tortoise, frog.  \nThat's not alphabetical.  \nSo maybe not.  \nAlternatively, maybe grouping them by some category .  \nOr maybe the instruction is to take the last occurrence of each animal in the input.  \nWait, let's think.  \nThe instruction might involve more than just selecting animals.  \nLet me check the first input again.  \nThe input also has \"scarf\" and others.  \nBut maybe the instruction is to remove certain elements.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all living things.  \nBut \"scarf\" is not a living thing.  \nSo that could be the same as animals.  \nBut maybe there's another layer.  \nLet me look at the outputs.  \nFor the first input, the output has 4 elements.  \nThe input had 7 elements.  \nSo the output is a subset.  \nFor the second input, output is 3 elements out of 5.  \nThird input: 4 out of 6.  \nFourth: 4 out of 7.  \nFifth: 4 out of 7.  \nSo the selection is not based on number, but on some criteria.  \nAnother thought: maybe the instruction is to exclude inanimate objects.  \nSo the output lists only the inanimate objects.  \nBut in the first input, \"chicken\" is a living thing, so that contradicts.  \nWait, no.  \nLet me think again.  \nIf the instruction is to exclude inanimate objects, then the output should have only animals.  \nBut in the first input, the output is all animals.  \nBut the input includes \"pancake\", \"car\", \"scarf\", which are inanimate.  \nSo the instruction is to select animals.  \nBut let me check the second input.  \nSo \"white\" is an adjective, not an animal, so it's excluded.  \nSo the instruction is to select all words that are animals.  \nBut wait, \"fly\" can be a verb, but here it's likely the insect.  \nSo the instruction is to pick animal names.  \nLet me confirm with the third input:  \nSo \"train\" and \"yellow\" are excluded.  \n\"Butterfly\" is an animal (insect), so that's included.  \n\"Spider\" is an animal.  \nSo yes.  \nSo the instruction is to select all words that refer to animals.  \nBut maybe there's a twist.  \nLet me check the order of the outputs.  \nThe outputs don't follow the order of the input.  \nThe original input had them in a different order.  \nSo the order in the output is different.  \nSo perhaps the instruction is \"List all the animal names sorted by length descending?\"  \nCheck lengths: chicken(7), whale(5), tortoise(8) – oh tortoise is 8 letters, frog(4).  \nBut tortoise is longest 8, chicken is 7, whale 5, frog 4.  \nSo that's not length.  \nMaybe by syllables?  \nSo likely it's not sorted.  \nPerhaps the instruction explicitly states that the order doesn't matter.</think> The instruction is: \"From the given list of words, select the words that represent animals and list them.\"\n\nSo the final instruction is: \"Select all the words from"

Let me start by analyzing each pair to find a pattern.  \nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair: Input is duck, snake, lemon, tortoise, penguin, brown, pink.  \nThe output is snake, tortoise, penguin, duck.  \nSo the output has four items from the input.  \nThe inputs include some animals and colors.  \nThe output seems to exclude 'lemon' and 'brown', 'pink '.  \nMaybe the instruction is related to animals?  \nBut then why are some colors in the input but not in the output?  \nLet me check the next example.  \nSecond input: tractor, spaceship, cat, lizard, panda. Output is panda, cat, lizard.  \nAgain, all animals except tractor and spaceship.  \nLet's check the first input again. The input includes duck (animal), snake (animal), lemon (fruit?), tortoise (animal), penguin (animal), brown (color), pink (color).  \nThe output excludes the colors.  \nSo that fits.  \nThen third input: whale, elephant, donkey, businessman (which is a person, not an animal?), tortoise, green . Output is tortoise, whale, donkey, elephant.  \nSo here, 'businessman' is excluded and 'green' is a color.  \nSo same pattern: remove non-animals and colors.  \nFourth input: orange (fruit), butterfly (insect), giraffe ( animal), train (vehicle), sandwich (food), hippo (animal), chicken (animal). Output is chicken, butterfly, giraffe, hippo.  \nSo again, removing non-animals (orange, train, sandwich).  \nThe fifth input: donkey (animal), glove (object), ambulance ( vehicle), panda (animal), sweater (clothing), duck (animal). Output: duck, donkey, panda.  \nThat matches again.  \nBut wait, in the first example, the output order is snake, tortoise, penguin, duck. The original order of animals in the input is duck, snake, tortoise, penguin. But in output, snake comes before duck?  \nWait the input order is duck first, then snake, then tortoise, penguin, etc. The output order is snake, tortoise, penguin, duck. So that's different.  \nBut in the first input, the order is duck, snake, tortoise , penguin, and the output is snake, tortoise, penguin , duck. So that's not matching.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list them in reverse order of their appearance.  \nFor example, the last animal in the input comes first? The last animal in the input is penguin, but the output starts with snake.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all the animals that are not birds ?  \nWait duck and penguin are birds, but they are included. So that can't be.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all the animals that are reptiles.  \nBut the output includes penguin and duck. So that's not it.  \nAnother idea: maybe the instruction is to list all the animals except those that are mammals.  \nBut the output includes mammals. So that's not it.  \nAnother idea: maybe the instruction is to list all the animals that are not the same color as any color in the input.  \nBut that's not relevant.  \nAnother possibility: maybe the instruction is to list all the animals except the ones that are in the input's color list.  \nBut again, the output includes all animals regardless.  \nHmm. Let's look at the third input-output pair.  \nInput: whale (mammal), elephant (mammal), donkey (mammal), businessman (person), tortoise (reptile), green (color). Output: tortoise, whale, donkey, elephant.  \nSo the output includes all the animals except businessman and green.  \nThe order here is tortoise, whale, donkey, elephant. The input order was whale, elephant, donkey, businessman, tortoise. So the tortoise comes last in input, but first in output.  \nSo the order isn't preserved.  \nLet's check.</think> The instruction is: \"List the animals from the input, excluding any non-animals and colors. The order of the output is not necessarily the same as the input.\"\n\n"

Input: [goat, butterfly, mouse, jeans, tiger, helicopter]; Output: [goat, butterfly, tiger, mouse ].  \nHmm, the output has four items, so maybe some items were removed.  \nLet's compare the original order.  \nThe output includes goat, butterfly, tiger, mouse.  \nSo in the original input, those four are present.  \nBut jeans is missing.  \nWhat about helicopter?  \nIt's not in the output.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to exclude certain types of items?  \nOr perhaps it's about filtering based on some characteristic.  \nLet me check the other pairs to see if there's a common pattern.  \nLooking at the second input: [horse, jellyfish, goat, green, actor]. The output is [goat, horse, jellyfish].  \nSo the output includes those three.  \nThe excluded items are green and actor.  \nSo \"green\" is a color, and \"actor\" is a profession.  \nMaybe the instruction is to remove colors and professions?  \nLet's check the third input: [cat, chicken, rabbit, par rot, spaceship, doctor]. Output: [cat, parrot, chicken, rabbit].  \nSo the output includes cat, parrot (which is a bird), chicken, rabbit.  \nThe excluded items are spaceship and doctor.  \nSpaceship is an object, doctor is a profession.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to remove any item that is a non-living thing (like jeans, helicopter, spaceship) or a profession (actor, doctor) or colors (green)?  \nWait, in the first input, jeans is clothing, which is an object, so maybe objects are excluded.  \nHelicopter is also an object.  \nIn the second input, green is a color, actor is a profession.  \nSo the outputs are only living things?  \nLet's check.  \nFirst output: goat (animal), butterfly (insect), tiger (animal), mouse (animal).  \nAll are animals.  \nSecond output: goat (animal), horse (animal), jellyfish (animal, though technically a marine animal).  \nThird output: cat (animal), parrot (bird), chicken (animal), rabbit (animal).  \nFourth output: duck (animal), hippo (animal), jellyfish (animal).  \nFifth output: donkey (animal), jellyfish (animal), camel (animal).  \nSo the outputs are all animals.  \nThe excluded items are non-animals: jeans (clothing), helicopter (vehicle), green (color), actor (profession), spaceship (object), doctor (profession), sweater (clothing), engineer (profession), yellow (color).  \nBut wait, what about \"parrot\" in the third input's output? Parrot is a bird, so that's included.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to include only animals.  \nBut why does the fourth input's output have \"hippo\"?  \nBecause in the input, \"hippo\" is an animal.  \nSo yes.  \nLet me check each input again.  \nFirst input: all outputs are animals.  \nThe excluded items are jeans (clothing) and helicopter (vehicle).  \nSecond input: excluded green (color) and actor (profession).  \nThird input: excluded spaceship (object) and doctor (profession).  \nFourth input: excluded pear (fruit), jacket (clothing).  \nFifth input: excluded yellow (color), sweater (clothing), engineer (profession).  \nThat seems consistent.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to select only animal names from the input list.  \nBut wait, what about \"parrot\" in the third input's output? Parrot is a bird, so that's included.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to include only animals.  \nBut why does the fourth input's output have \"hippo\"?  \nBecause in the input, \"hippo\" is an animal.  \nSo yes.  \nLet me confirm once again.  \nIn the first input, \"jeans\" is clothing, \"helicopter\" is a vehicle—both non-animals, so excluded.  \nThe second input's excluded items are \"green\" (color) and \"actor\" (profession).  \nThird input excludes \"spaceship\" (object) and \"doctor\" (profession).  \nFourth input excludes \"pear\" (fruit) and \"jacket\" (clothing).  \nFifth input excludes \"yellow\" (color), \"sweater\" (clothing), \"engineer\" (profession).  \nYes, all excluded items are non-animals.  \nThe outputs are only the animal names.  \nI think that's the pattern here.  \nLet me confirm.  \nIn the first input: jeans is clothing, helicopter is a vehicle, so excluded.  \nThe second input excludes green, actor.  \nThird input excludes spaceship, doctor.  \nFourth input excludes pear, jacket.  \nFifth input excludes yellow, sweater, engineer.  \nSo yes.</think> The instruction is: \"From the given list of items, select only the names of animals and list them in the order they appear in the input.\"\n\nThis instruction fits all"

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: helicopter, doctor, goat, spider, snail, glove, chicken\nOutput: goat, spider, chicken, snail\n\nInput: dentist, snake, bean, chicken, ambulance, parrot, duck\nOutput: snake, duck, parrot, chicken\n\nInput: jellyfish, waiter, trousers, goat, spider\nOutput: spider, jellyfish, goat\n\nInput: rabbit, parrot, spaceship, car, lemon, camel, butterfly\nOutput: parrot, rabbit, butterfly, camel\n\nInput: swimsuit, dress, zebra, trousers, fly, butterfly\nOutput: butterfly, fly, zebra\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>Okay, let's see.  \nI need to figure out what the instruction was that led to these outputs based on the given input-output pairs.  \nHmm, the user provided five examples, each with a list of items and the corresponding output list.  \nThe task is to deduce the common rule or criteria that the friend used to select the output items from each input list.  \nFirst, I'll start by looking at each input and output pair to see if I can spot any patterns or categories that the selected items have in common.  \nLet me go through each example one by one.  \n\nFirst input: helicopter, doctor, goat, spider, snail, glove, chicken.  \nOutput is goat, spider, chicken, snail.  \nLet me list those: goat (animal), spider (arachnid), chicken (bird), snail (mollusk).  \nThe input includes various things like objects (helicopter, glove), professions ( doctor), animals (goat, spider, chicken, snail).  \nSo the output seems to pick all the animals from the input.  \nWait, but the snail is an animal too, so maybe that's it.  \nLet me check the next example to confirm.  \n\nSecond input: dentist, snake, bean, chicken, ambulance, parrot , duck.  \nThe output is snake, duck, parrot, chicken.  \nAgain, those are all animals.  \nSnake is a reptile, duck is a bird, parrot is a bird, chicken is a bird.  \nThe input includes a profession (dentist ), object (bean), and animals.  \nSo output is all animals.  \nBut wait, the first input's output included snail, which is an invertebrate but still an animal.  \nSo perhaps the instruction is to select all animal items from the input list.  \nLet me check the third example to confirm.  \n\nThird input: jellyfish, waiter, trousers, goat, spider.  \nOutput: spider, jellyfish, goat.  \nAll animals again.  \nThe input has waiter (job), trousers (clothing), and the rest are animals.  \nSo output is all animals.  \nFourth input: rabbit, parrot, spaceship, car, lemon, camel , butterfly.  \nOutput: parrot, rabbit, butterfly, camel.  \nThese are all animals except maybe car, lemon, spaceship.  \nThe output includes butterfly, which is an insect, but still an animal.  \nSo yes, all animals.  \nFifth input: swimsuit, dress, zebra, trousers, fly, butterfly.  \nOutput: butterfly, fly, zebra.  \nFly and butterfly are insects, zebra is a mammal, so all animals.  \nThe inputs here have clothes (swimsuit, dress, trousers).  \nSo in all cases, the output is all the animal items from the input .  \nBut wait, the first example had a glove, which is not an animal , but the output didn't include it.  \nSimilarly, the second input had bean, which is a plant, but not in the output.  \nSo the rule seems to be selecting only the animals from the inputs.  \nBut let me double-check each input to make sure there's no other pattern .  \nFor example, in the first input, the output includes snail, which is an animal, but also spider (arachnid) and chicken ( bird).  \nSo the output is all animals.  \nHowever, maybe there's a more specific category?  \nLet me think again.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to remove certain categories.  \nFor example, removing professions, objects, clothing, etc.  \nBut in the first example, the output has snail, which is an animal.  \nThe input had glove, which is an object.  \nSo if the instruction was to remove non-living things, but snail is living.  \nWait, but the output includes snail.  \nHmm.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to select items that are animals and also have a certain property.  \nLet me check each output again.  \nFor example, maybe the number of letters?  \nNot sure.  \nLet me think of another angle.  \nLet's look at the outputs.  \nThe first output has goat, spider, chicken, snail.  \nThe second output: snake, duck, parrot, chicken.  \nThe third: spider, jellyfish, goat.  \nFourth: parrot, rabbit, butterfly, camel.  \nFifth: butterfly, fly, zebra.  \nLet's count the number of elements in each output.  \nFirst output has 4, second 4, third 3, fourth 4, fifth 3.  \nThe counts vary.  \nSo that's probably not the rule.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list the animals in alphabetical order?  \nLet's check.  \nFirst output: goat, spider, chicken, snail.  \nAlphabetically, chicken comes before goat, snail comes after spider, so no.  \nSecond output: snake, duck, parrot, chicken.  \nNot in order.  \nThird: spider, jellyfish, goat.  \nAlphabetical order would be jellyfish, goat, spider.  \nNot matching.  \nSo not alphabetical.  \nAnother idea: maybe the instruction is to list the animals that are predators.  \nBut that might not fit.  \nFor example, chicken isn't a predator.  \nOr maybe the animals that are vertebrates?  \nBut jellyfish is a cnidarian, which is a type of invertebrate.  \nThe third output includes jellyfish.  \nSo that's not it.  \nAlternatively, maybe the output is the animals that can fly?  \nBut chicken can't fly.  \nSpider can't fly.  \nSo that doesn't fit.  \nAnother thought: maybe the instruction is to list all living things, but that would include plants.  \nFor example, the second input had bean, which is a plant, but the output didn't include it.  \nSo that's not it.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to list all animals except certain types?  \nNot sure.  \nLet me think again.  \nThe outputs are all the animals in each input.  \nLet me confirm each input.  \nFirst input: helicopter (object), doctor (profession), goat (animal), spider (animal), snail (animal), glove (object), chicken (animal).  \nSo the output is exactly the four animals.  \nSecond input: dentist (profession), snake (animal), bean (plant), chicken (animal), ambulance (object), parrot (animal), duck (animal).  \nOutput is the four animals.  \nThird input: jellyfish (animal), waiter (job), trousers (clothing), goat (animal), spider (animal).  \nSo the output is the three animals.  \nFourth input: rabbit (animal), parrot (animal), spaceship (object), car (object), lemon (fruit), camel (animal), butterfly (animal).  \nThe output includes all four animals.  \nFifth input: swimsuit (clothing), dress (clothing), zebra (animal), trousers (clothing), fly (insect), butterfly (insect).  \nThe output has three animals (including insects).  \nSo in all cases, the output is all the animals present in the input.  \nThat seems to fit perfectly.  \nLet me check if there are any exceptions.  \nFor example, in the third input, jellyfish is an animal, and it's included.  \nThe outputs don't exclude any animals.  \nThe only exclusion is non-animals.  \nLet me see if there's another possible rule.  \nMaybe the instruction is to remove certain categories.  \nFor example, remove professions, objects, clothing, etc.  \nAlternatively, maybe it's to list things that are living beings.  \nBut in that case, plants like beans would be included.  \nBut in the second input, the output didn't include bean, which is a plant.  \nSo that can't be.  \nLet me verify once more.  \nFor each input, the output is exactly the animals present.  \nFirst input: yes.  \nSecond input: yes.  \nThird: yes.  \nFourth: yes.  \nFifth: yes.  \nSo that seems to fit.</think> The instruction is: \"From the given list, select all the items that are animals.\"\n\nSo the rule is to identify and list all the items from the input that represent"
