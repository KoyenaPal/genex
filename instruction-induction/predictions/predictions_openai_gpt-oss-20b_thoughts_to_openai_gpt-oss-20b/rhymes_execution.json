So replace 'll' with 'nn'. invitation -> station: invitation: i n v i t a t i o n. station: s t a t i o n. So remove 'invi' and add 's t a'? Actually station is 'station'. So invitation -> station: remove 'invi' and replace with 's t a'? Not.\n\nmusician -> composition: musician: m u s i c i a n. composition: c o m p o s i t i o n. So not simple.\n\nname -> game: replace n with g. cake -> shake: add sh before cake.\n\nMaybe instruction: \"Add a letter to the beginning of the word to form a new word that is related to the original word\"? collect->connect: connect is related to collect? Not.\n\nMaybe instruction: \"Take the input word, replace the first letter with the letter that is one position later in the alphabet, and then add 't' at the end\"?

Observing mapping: cave -> behave. snow -> so. relation -> station. mess -> less. sick -> quick. Looks like adding 'b' to front? Actually 'cave' to 'behave' adds 'b' and 'h'?

Not simple.\n\nMaybe instruction: \"Add a letter to the beginning to make a word that rhymes with the input\"? Not.\n\nCheck: 'snow' -> 'so' remove 'n' and 'w'. 'relation' -> 'station' remove 'rel' and add 'st'? 'mess' -> 'less' replace 'm' with 'l'. 'sick' -> 'quick' replace 's' with 'qu'.\n\nSeems pattern: replace first letter with another letter to form new word. For 'cave' -> 'behave' replace 'c' with 'b', but also add 'h' after? Actually 'behave' is 'be' + 'have'. 'cave' is 'c' + 'ave'. So replace 'c' with 'b' and add 'h' after 'b'? 'snow' -> 'so' replace 'n' and 'w' removed. 'relation' -> 'station' replace 'rel' with 'st'. 'mess' -> 'less' replace 'm' with 'l'. 'sick' -> 'quick' replace 's' with 'qu'.\n\nSo instruction maybe: \"Replace the first letter(s) of the input with the first letter of the output's first word\"?

Not.\n\nMaybe instruction: \"Take the input, replace its first letter with the first letter of the word 'be', then add 'h' after that letter, and keep rest.\" For 'cave': replace 'c' with 'b' -> 'bave', add 'h' after 'b' -> 'bhave', but output 'behave'. So need 'be' + 'have'. So maybe instruction: \"Add 'be' to the front of the input and then add 'h' after the first letter of the input\"?
