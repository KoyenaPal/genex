Koi is a fish, size maybe bigger than toy poodle? Toy poodle small. So choose larger. Dog vs horse: horse bigger. Chinook vs crocodile: crocodile bigger. Jaguar vs common carp: jaguar bigger. So rule: choose the larger animal. But maybe choose the one that is heavier? That matches. So instruction: \"Given two animals, output the one that is larger in size.\" Or \"output the animal that is bigger.\" Could be \"output the animal that is heavier.\" But size vs weight? Elephant heavier than chamois. Toy poodle vs koi: koi heavier? A koi can weigh up to 10-20 lbs, toy poodle maybe 5-10 lbs. So koi heavier. Dog vs horse: horse heavier. Chinook vs crocodile: crocodile heavier. Jaguar vs common carp: jaguar heavier. So rule: choose heavier. So instruction: \"Given two animals, output the one that is heavier.\" That seems plausible.

The pattern: given two animal names, output one of them. Which one? Let's analyze: Input pairs: (jaguar, donkey) -> jaguar. (sperm whale, labradoodle) -> sperm whale. (guinea pig, wildebeest) -> wildebeest. (dog, elephant) -> elephant. (whale shark, cockapoo) -> whale shark.\n\nSo output is the first animal in first two pairs, but second in last three? Wait: first pair: first is jaguar, output jaguar. second pair: first is sperm whale, output sperm whale. third pair: first is guinea pig, output wildebeest (second). fourth: first dog, output elephant (second). fifth: first whale shark, output whale shark (first). So pattern not consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: choose the animal that is larger? Let's check: jaguar vs donkey: jaguar is larger? Jaguar weight ~ 50-90 kg, donkey ~ 150-200 kg. Donkey heavier. So not larger. Maybe choose the animal that is more carnivorous? Jaguar is carnivore, donkey herbivore. So choose carnivore. sperm whale is carnivore, labradoodle is dog (carnivore too). But both carnivores. But maybe choose the one that is marine? sperm whale marine, labradoodle terrestrial. So choose marine. For guinea pig vs wildebeest: guinea pig herbivore, wildebeest herbivore. Both herbivores. But maybe choose the one that is larger? wildebeest larger. So choose larger. dog vs elephant: dog small, elephant large. Choose larger. whale shark vs cockapoo: whale shark marine, cockapoo terrestrial. Choose marine. So rule: choose the animal that is marine if one is marine, else choose the larger animal. Let's test: first pair: jaguar (terrestrial) vs donkey (terrestrial). Both terrestrial, choose larger: donkey heavier. But output jaguar. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: choose the animal that is more \"dangerous\"? Jaguar dangerous, donkey not. sperm whale dangerous, labradoodle not. guinea pig not dangerous, wildebeest not dangerous. dog not dangerous, elephant dangerous. So choose dangerous? For guinea pig vs wildebeest, both not dangerous. But output wildebeest. So maybe choose the one that is more \"wild\"? Jaguar wild, donkey domesticated. sperm whale wild, labradoodle domesticated. guinea pig domesticated, wildebeest wild. dog domesticated, elephant wild. whale shark wild, cockapoo domesticated. So rule: choose the wild animal. That fits all: jaguar wild, donkey domesticated -> output jaguar. sperm whale wild, labradoodle domesticated -> sperm whale. guinea pig domesticated, wildebeest wild -> wildebeest. dog domesticated, elephant wild -> elephant. whale shark wild, cockapoo domesticated -> whale shark. Yes! So instruction likely: \"Given two animal names, output the one that is wild (not domesticated).\"\n\nBut what about ambiguous? But seems plausible. So instruction: \"Choose the animal that is not domesticated.\" Or \"Return the animal that is wild.\" So answer: The instruction was to output the wild animal from the pair.
