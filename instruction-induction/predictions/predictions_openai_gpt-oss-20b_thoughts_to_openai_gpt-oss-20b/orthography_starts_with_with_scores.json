The pattern: Input sentence, bracket letter indicates something. Output is a word from sentence. For each, the bracket letter seems to indicate which letter to pick? Let's see:\n\n1. Input: \"I am anxious for you to arrive on time.\" [t] Output: \"to time\". The bracket t maybe indicates the letter t? The output is \"to time\" which is a phrase from the sentence: \"to arrive on time\" but output is \"to time\" missing \"arrive on\". So maybe they removed words that contain the letter t? Wait \"to time\" contains t. The words \"to\" and \"time\" both contain t. The phrase \"to arrive on time\" includes \"to\" and \"time\". They removed \"arrive on\". So maybe they keep words that start with t? \"to\" starts with t, \"time\" starts with t. Yes. So output is words starting with t. That matches.\n\n2. Input: \"Confiscate any liquor.\" [c] Output: \"confiscate\". Words starting with c: \"Confiscate\" and \"any\" and \"liquor\" - only \"Confiscate\" starts with c. So output \"confiscate\". Good.\n\n3. Input: \"We peered around the room.\" [a] Output: \"around\". Words starting with a: \"around\". Good.\n\n4. Input: \"Why did you kill Pegasus?\" [k] Output: \"kill\". Words starting with k: \"kill\". Good.\n\n5. Input: \"Susan found every book she had been looking for at Borders.\" [l] Output: \"looking\". Words starting with l: \"looking\". Good.\n\nSo instruction: \"Return the word(s) in the sentence that start with the letter in brackets.\" Or \"Return the word(s) that start with the letter in brackets.\" The bracket letter indicates the target letter.
