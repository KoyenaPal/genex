Observing mapping: opportunity->chance (synonym). submit->state? Not synonym. Maybe \"verb to noun\"? submit (verb) -> state (noun). boring->slow (synonym). summation->addition (synonym). confluence->meeting (synonym). So instruction likely: \"Give a synonym that is a noun\" or \"Give a synonym that is a noun\" but submit->state is noun. opportunity->chance noun. boring->slow adjective? slow is adjective. So maybe \"Give a synonym that is a noun or adjective\"? But summation->addition noun. confluence->meeting noun. So maybe \"Give a synonym that is a noun or adjective that is shorter\"? Not sure. Maybe instruction: \"Give a synonym that is a single word, not a phrase.\" But all are single words. Maybe \"Give a synonym that is a noun or adjective that is more common.\" Hard.\n\nCould be \"Give a synonym that is a noun or adjective that is a single word and not a verb.\" But submit is verb, state noun. So maybe instruction: \"Give a synonym that is a noun.\" But boring->slow is adjective. So maybe \"Give a synonym that is a noun or adjective.\" That fits all. So instruction: \"Give a synonym of the input word that is a noun or adjective.\" But why choose state for submit? Because state is noun. For boring, slow is adjective.
