Let me see. The user provided five input-output pairs and I have to work backward to find the instruction used.\n\nFirst, let me list them out properly. So the given information is:\n\n1. Input: \"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you.\"\n   Output: \"Cats are black, dogs are brown, birds can fly, all around town.\"\n\n2. Input: \"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.\"\n   Output: \"Gentle gentle morning breeze, brings my worried mind to ease.\"\n\n3. Input: \"Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow, everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.\"\n   Output: \"Tommy had a baseball bat, his swing was strong and true, everywhere that Tommy played, his friends would cheer him too.\"\n\n4. Input: \"Hickory Dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock.\"\n   Output: \"Pickory tickory tock, the bird flew round the block.\"\n\n5. Input: \"Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water, Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.\"\n   Output: \"Tom and Sue walked through the zoo, to see the big gorilla, Tom got scared and quickly ran, while Sue just stood there stiller.\"\n\nThe instruction given is something we need to figure out each of these inputs being processed by following an instruction to generate the outputs. So from each pair, we can probably deduce what the instruction is about. Let me look for patterns here.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each input-output pair:\n\nLooking at input and output:\n\n1. The first set is natural statements about colors and maybe someone's state, mapping to certain colors or traits.\n\n2. Wait, the input seems to be compound sentences with clauses linked by commas, and outputs are sentences about different categories or objects.\n\nWait, let me check step by step.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is about characteristic colors to objects, where each word pair in input is translated into the output object's descriptor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a riddle where each word-like word refers to another property.\n\nWait, \"Roses are red\" and the output is \"Cats are black\"—maybe each descriptor maps to a different object.\n\nSecond input: \"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.\" Output is \"Gentle gentle morning breeze, brings my worried mind to ease.\"\n\nThird input: \"Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow, everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.\" Output: \"Tommy had a baseball bat, his swing was strong and true, everywhere that Tommy played, his friends would cheer him too.\"\n\nThe last ones seem similar.</think> The instruction is: Convert poetic or abstract phrases into more specific attributes of objects or scenarios.\n\nLet's look for a common theme.

Input:sun is bright, sky is clear,... Output: moon white, stars appear...  \nLooking at words here—maybe the input and output involve different natural phenomena or activities?  \n\nSecond Input: Rain ... Output snow... Hmm.  \n\nThird Input: Flowers ... Output cookies .. Maybe related to plants or natural elements.  \n\nFourth Input: Birthday-like (birds etc.) leading to... sea and ocean-related.  \n\nFifth input: shoe-related leading to-zoo...  \n\nThe words seem like something to do with nature and actions, perhaps instructions on how to do certain activities or manage the environment.  \n\nWait, let's see the outputs. Maybe it's a set of verbs transformed word-for-word but replacing some action terms.  \n\nLooking for patterns: it's like the input has phrases describing an action or setting and the output is another set of words or actions.  \n\nPerhaps it's suggesting a \"perfect day\" (perfect state) and then related to playing outdoors. Wait alternatively, it might relate to a specific task.  \n\nLooking further, perhaps it's a set of guidelines or activity instruction. Let me check the second Input and its output.  \n\nWait another approach: Let's list each Input and output phrase by phrase and see relation.  \n\nPerhaps it's related to natural sounds or activities in a particular setting, like beach or a forest.</think> The instruction is: A day of activities where nature is peaceful and productive, encouraging outdoor enjoyment or a satisfying experience with various elements like sun, rain, nature elements, etc",

There are five input sentences paired with their outputs. The instruction is what I need to determine. The friend used an instruction which they fed to look at five different inputs and got five outputs. My goal is to figure out what that instruction was.  \n\nLet me go through each input-output pair one by one.  \n\n1. Input: \"Tiger prowling through the night, stripes of orange black and white, hunting prey with keen eyesight, powerful and filled with might.\"  \n   Output: \"Eagle soaring through the day, feathers brown and white and grey, searching for its silver prey, graceful in its flying way.\"  \n\n2. Input: \"Waterfall cascades down steep, into pools crystal and deep, where the silver fishes leap, nature's promise they will keep.\"  \n   Output: \"Mountain stream flows clear and bright, sparkling in the morning light, babbling songs from day to night, making everything seem right.\"  \n\n3. Input: \"Telescope points to the stars, searching planets near and far, Venus Jupiter and Mars, cosmic wonders where they are.\"  \n   Output: \"Microscope reveals the small, tiny worlds invisible to all, bacteria and cells so small, nature's miracles enthrall.\"  \n\n4. Input: \"Lighthouse beacon shines so bright, guiding ships throughout the night, warning them of rocky bight, safety harbor comes in sight.\"  \n   Output: \"Campfire glowing orange and gold, keeping travelers from the cold, stories round the fire told, memories worth more than gold.\"  \n\n5. Input: \"Dragonfly skims pond so blue, iridescent green and new, dancing in the morning dew, nature's magic coming through.\"  \n   Output: \"Hummingbird sips nectar sweet, tiny wings in rapid beat, hovering so light and fleet, nature's marvel so complete.\"  \n\nSo, I need to find a common theme or set of actions in the outputs relative to the inputs.  \n\nLooking first input sentence about Tiger's behavior and translated to Eagle's soaring through different times. The outputs involve different nature related actions. Maybe it's a scientific or observational prompt related to nature. Let me look at each sentence:  \n\nFirst Input and Output pair:  \nInput: Tiger (phenomenon), outputs about the Eagle ( bird behavior).  \n\nSecond Input is about falling waterfall, outputs relate to a mountain stream and related elements.  \n\nThird Input talks about telescope looking at stars and planets; output mentions a microscope and nature's miracles.  \n\nFourth Input involves lighthouse, outputs talks about a fire and stories memories.  \n\nFifth input discusses dragonfly pond and outputs talk about a hummingbird.  \n\nIt seems each input represents something (like an animal or natural element), and the outputs describe actions or events related to that natural phenomenon or object's characteristics in different settings.  \n\nThe outputs seem to involve descriptive phrases with sensory elements, perhaps similes or metaphors.  \n\nLet me look for common actions. Maybe it's about nature observation or activity:  \n\n1. Input: Tiger prowling night – output is Eagle soaring through day. That seems like switching from night to day position.  \n2. Input about waterfall becomes a mountain stream with flowing clear.  \n3. telescope output about observing.  \n4. lighthouse output about guiding.  \n5. dragonfly input to hummingbird output.  \n\nRe-reading the outputs:  \n\nFirst Input's output talks about the eagle soaring, featuring its feathers, searching for prey, graceful flying.  \n\nSecond Input output talks about mountain streams with sparkling morning light and songs.  \n\nThird output involves a microscope and bacteria/cells being small.  \n\nFourth mentions a campfire keeping travelers warm and memories told.  \n\nFifth related to dragonfly, with outputs talking about hovering.</think> The instruction is: Observe and describe natural phenomena or elements, perhaps capturing their characteristics or behaviors using a descriptive or metaphorical language.  \n\nAlternatively, considering the transformations from",
