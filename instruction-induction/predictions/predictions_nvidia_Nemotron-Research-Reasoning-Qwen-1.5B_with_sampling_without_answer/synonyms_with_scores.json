Wait, maybe it's a verb that starts with 'efficient'? Wait or maybe it's a suffix transformation.  \nWait, 'excessively' has 'excess' + 'ly'. Maybe the output 'too' could be the first part 'too.' Hmmm not directly obvious.  \nSecond input: \"leadership\" gives \"leading.\" Leadership starts with 'leash'? Maybe removing some ending? Leadership without 'ship' becomes leading? Maybe taking off 'ness' or something?  \nWait let's look for the relationship.  \nAnother approach: Maybe it's a reduction in certain letters or parts.  \n\"excessively\" is 8 letters. \"too\" is 3. Hmm.  \nBut perhaps related as 'excess' reduced or shortened, but 'too' is just 'excess' missing something. Maybe it's a contraction.  \nSecond pair: \"leaders\" outputs \"leading.\" So \"leaders\" meaning active leadership is transformed into 'leading,' which sounds like leading as opposed maybe of leadership? Hmm, \"leaders\" is pronounced differently, maybe it's a play here? Maybe it's the first syllable being removed?  \nThird pair: Input is \"art\" gives \"prouve.\" Wait, art becomes prowess? \"Art\" is similar to \"prownde\"? Or perhaps 'art' is related to 'arch'. But 'prense' would be 'person'? Maybe not.  \nWait output \"prouve\" meaning to establish or demonstrate. Input is 'art', which is a word about art or science.  \nMaybe it's the name 'P ROVE'? Wait 'prove' sounds like a verb... maybe it's the root or something else.  \nFourth input: \"commend\" outputs \"remember.\" So \"commend\" relates to commendation? Output 'remember.' That seems like it's a verb form.  \nFifth: \"accomplished\" becomes \"complete.\" So, accomplished becoming 'complete.' Maybe a noun change? accomplished is 'made,' complete relates to completed.  \nLet me think about possible rules.  \nLooking for the operations:  \n1. Ex-very-sensively... Output as 'too.' Maybe chopping off 'excessively...' no.  \nLooking at the actual meanings.  \nSuppose the rule is shortening a word to its base form. \"Excessively\" could be reduced to something. 'Excessively' starts with 'excess'. So maybe taking the prefix 'ex' and adding '-sively'? But the output is 'too' which starts with 'too'.  \nAlternatively, 'Leadership' reduces to 'leading.' Which suggests removing 'ship'.  </think> The instruction is: The word is transformed by removing the suffix related to \"ness.\"  \n\nWait or perhaps the instruction is \" shorten the word by removing the past tense form",

Let me see:  \nFirst pair: opportunity leads to chance. Hmm. “Give an instruction” likely meant an action. So, what action when an investor an instruction leading to transforming or something?  \nInput: opportunity → maybe it’s getting an opportunity, which results in the action of being “chance”? Wait, no.  \nWait, looking at other outputs:  \nInput submit → output state. Submitting something might lead to state.  \nSummation leads to addition. Maybe some function transformation here.  \nConfluence might lead to meeting. Maybe an action tied to connecting or integrating.  \nWait possible instruction could be the function or process used to transform input into output.  \nLet me think each step:  \nIf the instruction is creating something related… Maybe “making an action from something into its chance.” Not sure.  \nMaybe synonyms won’t hold for all.  \nSo maybe not synonyms.

Input: usher → Output: show\n\nI need to find a common rule or relationship between the input and output for each transformation.\n\nLooking first at the first pair: knowledgeable turning into knowing.\n\nIt seems like 'knowless' might add an 'ing,' but here 'knowing' is the output for something starting with knowledgeable. Wait, let's think differently.\n\nLet me consider the number of letters or the process of derivation. Maybe it's a transformation function based on some rules.\n\nWait, looking at another pair: 'picking' changes to 'pick'. It seems like if you remove the suffix 'ing', like 'pickly' could mean pick with something, but 'picked' vs 'pick'. Hmm maybe it's the verb form change?\n\nWait another approach: Maybe it's about shortening or abbreviating. For example, 'knowing' comes from 'know less'; 'knowing something' is another form, but 'knowing' itself comes from 'know'. Wait, 'know' + 'ing'. Maybe the rule is taking the root and adding 'ing'? But let's test.\n\nLet's look at the first input.\n\nInput: knowledgeable  \nOutput: knowing\n\nIf 'knowing' is formed by 'know' + 'ing', so it's just adding 'ing' to knowable? Wait no.\n\nWait, 'knowing' is formed by 'know' + 'ing'. If the root is 'know', it seems like maybe removing something. The input is 'knowledgeable?' Wait the input is 'knowing,' and output 'knowing.'\n\nWait maybe input is a longer form and gets shortened?\n\nInput 'knowing' → Output 'knowing' - but that's same, not helpful.\n\nWait maybe it's removing 'less'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe inputs are nouns transformed into the corresponding suffix words.\n\nAlternatively, inputs are all adjectives:\n\nknowable (input knows about something), output 'knowing'?\n\nWait first input is 'knowable'? No, input is knowledgeable, output is knowing. Wait ' KNOWLEDGEABLE would become knowable, but output is knowing. Wait 'ex' maybe?\n\nLet's list the transformations:\n\n1. knowledgeable → knowing  \n2. picking → pick  \n3. rolled → rolling  \n4. antique → ex  \n5. usher → show\n\nLooking at the outputs: knowing, pick, rolling, ex, show.\n\nMaybe it's related to abbreviations or suffix changes.\n\nFirst transformation: knowledgeable becomes knowing. Maybe 'know' is the stem.\n\nLet's check: knowledgeable would remove 'less than', not sure. Maybe shortening.\n\nInput 'know' something would be 'knowledge', which then is 'knowing...' Wait knowledgeable is k now 'knowing'.\n\nWait knowledgeable is 'know' 'able' or 'wise'? No. Wait knowledgeable is about knowing well.\n\nIf the transformation is 'knowledge' to 'knowing', perhaps the 'd' perhaps is removed? 'know-' + 'ing'? 'knowing.'\n\nMaybe it's removing 'less'?\n\nInput 'less known' produce 'knowing'? Possibly hint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's something entirely different.</think> The instruction is: transform any word into its base form plus 'ing'.\n\nWait let's look:\n\nInput:\n\n\"knowledgeable\" would be 'knowing'\n\n\"pick",

Input: plate, Output: scale  \n5. Input: bespeak, Output: point  \n\nAnd the friend used this instruction for each input-output pair. The task is to figure out the rule or statement of the instruction by looking at how the output relates to the input.\n\nFirst, I should analyze each input-output pair to determine the relationship.\n\nStarting with 'curvature' leading to 'curve'. Hmm, curvature usually refers to the shape of something, perhaps related to the form or motion of something curving. The output here could be 'curve', which makes sense—it's the adjective form of curvature.\n\nNext: Input 'condition', Output 'term'. Maybe 'term' relates to condition, like a definition or rule. So condition can sometimes refer to a term or definition in terms of definition.\n\nThird input 'necessitate' giving 'take'. \"Necessitate\" is something that must happen, and 'take' here might mean to take action or a directive action. It's possible the instruction is about something being conditional or necessary.\n\nFourth input 'plate' outputs 'scale.' A plate scaling... Hmm, plate could be a surface or part of an object; scale might scale its properties or something related.\n\nFifth input 'bespeak' giving 'point.' That seems more specific, point might be involved with a relationship or characteristic within something identified.\n\nLooking at the instructions, perhaps it's an instruction phrase or verb.\n\nLet me list possible instructions. Maybe it's like: \"to describe the condition or cause (curvature) as a curve...\", but no, more likely actions.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to assign output based on relating to the concept. Let me consider forming a command or a function. Alternatively, maybe it's about processes like \"to determine the term of something.\" Maybe an instruction about terms in definitions or relationships.\n\nLet me list possible connections.\n\n1. curvature -> curve: curvature relates to the line dividing something curvature-related, output being 'curve', which is the resulting form.  \n2. condition -> term: perhaps specify the term/definition, or categorize it into a defined term.  \n3. necessitate -> take: This might mean necessitate to take an action, like consequence or requirement.  \n4. plate -> scale: perhaps take into scale something related to size or proportion?  \n5. bespeak -> point – maybe a term refers to the point of speaking or highlighting.  </think> The instruction is: \"To map the term or descriptor to form a curve or take action.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an action to assign terms or conditions through specific outcomes",
