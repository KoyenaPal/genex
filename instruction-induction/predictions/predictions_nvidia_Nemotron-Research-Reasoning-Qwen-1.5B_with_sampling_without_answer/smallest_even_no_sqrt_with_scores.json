Maybe not.  \nWhat if you sum the numbers and then take the square root?  \nFirst input numbers:7+16+3+36+15=77, sqrt(77)= about 8.77, not 4.  \nMultiply numbers: product isn't reasonable either, 7*16*3*.. way too big.  \nHow about the mean? (7+16+3+36+15)/5= (7+16=23; 23+3=26; 26+36=62; 62+15=77; 77/5=15.4), output 4 doesn't match.  \nAlternatively count unique numbers or unique elements... How many unique numbers?  \nFirst input: 7, 16, 3,36,15 are all distinct: 5 elements give output 4? Maybe 5-1? No, but maybe number of proper divisors or something else. Let me check if the outputs relate to the number of factors:  \nNumber of divisors of something.  \nLook at the outputs:  \nFirst output is 4, could four factors? Not sure. Let's check each number.  \nBut input numbers like 36 is composite, divisors more.  \nMaybe prime count?  \nWait input 7 has output 1 or something, maybe output is number of prime numbers in input list? Let's see:  \nFirst input:7 (prime),16 (not prime),3(prime),36 (not), 15(not).  \nSo primes are 7,3, output=2 something but output is 4. Maybe count of something else. Maybe the number themselves? Let me check.  \nOutput is 4. Looking for count? Maybe the count of even numbers? Let's check:  \nEven numbers: 16 and 36? Wait 16 is even (yes),36 is even. Others are odd. So count is 2. Output is4—not matching.  \nSo that's not it.  \nMaybe the count of primes:  \n7 is prime, 16 not, 3 is prime, 36 not, 15 not. Prime counts are 7 and3.

Let me look for relationships. Let me start by focusing on the first set of inputs:\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nMaybe it's pairwise operations? Or maybe taking numbers and applying some function.\n\nAlternatively, it might involve some formula involving indices or the sum, product, something.\n\nWait, often such puzzles use functions involving the sum or differences.\n\nFor instance, the first input list: numbers are [11, 196, 5,64,7]. Let me compute.\n\nSuppose we calculate something like (11, 196, 5,64,7) → Output 8.\n\nLet me see if 1+ something comes? Hmm no.\n\nMaybe summing indices but not sure. Wait another approach: consider each output is related to numbers somehow.\n\nWait Output1 is 8, Input1 uses 11, 196,5,64,7; let's see if we can relate them:\n\nCompute numbers: 11, 196,... Maybe sqrt(196) =14, 64 is 8 squared.\n\nWait 11 is perhaps  the difference? Or add something.\n\nWait input: 11,196,5,64,7\n\nIf it's the difference between 11 and 7: 4. But output is 8; 4*2=8.\n\nMaybe something multiplied by 2?\n\nWait let me test:\n\n11 -7 =4; 4*2=8 so perhaps subtract last two numbers? Wait first two numbers being subtracted:\n\nWait perhaps output is (1+something).\n\nWait let's make a hypothesis.\n\nTry Output1= sqrt( something).\n\nsqrt(196)=14; 14 - (something else)+11? 14 - something: 14 -6=8; input has numbers like 11, 196,... etc. Let's check:\n\nLet me check if output is related to 196 minus 116? 196- something? Wait the input includes 6 and 7.\n\nWait perhaps product of 11 and 7 minus  something: (11*7)=77; 77 minus something is 8: 69 something? No.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's the sum of two consecutive numbers?\n\nLooking at output is 8. Let me look at other outputs:\n\nOutput2: Input is 9,36,13,400,25; output6\n\nLet me try Output = number found in the input? Output is 6, seems small.\n\nMaybe 9 + something? Let me check:\n\nIf output is sum indices? The position-wise? Maybe the number of letters or something. Wait another approach is more likely, think about possible transformation per the outputs.\n\nLooking for a pattern across all outputs:\n\nOutputs are 8,6,18,4,2 for inputs varying. Each single output number. Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, look if these outputs follow an arithmetic or geometric progression? 8,6,18,4,2: Doesn't seem regular.\n\nAlternatively, think each output relates to the count or relationship between pairs or something like index of output being the sum divided by something of numbers?\n\nWait  output numbers:\n\n8, 6, 18, 4,2. Maybe relating each number to the count or something\n\nAnother thought: perhaps for each list Input, an arithmetic mean? Mean Input?\n\nCompute for first Input: sum of numbers: 11+196+5+64+7=  11+196=207, 207+5=212, 212+64=276, 276+7=283\n\n283 / number of elements? 5 numbers: 283/5≈56.6 not 8.\n\nOutput is 8 not close.\n\nLet me think product: 11*196*5*64*7.\n\nCompute this: 11*196=2156, 2156*5=10780, 10780*64=690,2... Wait over the top, maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively consider the difference between the largest and smallest number perhaps.\n\nFirst input numbers:11,196,5,64,7. Min 5, Max 196. 196 -5=191. 191 something not 8.\n\nMaybe floor something? 191/23something. Not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach, output 1 is 8, which is result from  perhaps  sqrt(somethings). First Input includes 64, which is 8 squared. Output is 8.\n\nWait 64 is part of the input, maybe take sqrt(64)=8 and that's your output.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIs the output the square root of one of the numbers or something.\n\nSecond Input: 9, 36,13,400,25. Output:6.\n\nLooking at numbers:36 is square6², sqrt(36)=6. Output is6 so maybe Output is sqrt of a number, perhaps 36 is in input. Let's see output is6. This could fit.\n\nThird input:17,6,19,324,15 → Output18. 324 is18², sqrt(324)=18. So output is 18. Maybe it is sqrt(324).\n\nFourth input is 3,81,11,16,21 → Output4. 81 is9², sqrt is9, but output is4. Not matching. Maybe sum digits: 3+81=84; 8+ something?\n\nFifth input 35,225,27,4,41 → Output2. 225 is15²; sqrt(225)=15. Output is2; not matching 15.\n\nWait the output is 18 is sqrt(324), 6 is probably sqrt(36), output 4: let's see 16 is 4² or sqrt(16)=4. Maybe it's sqrt of the third number?

Let me think about possible operations.  \nSo perhaps it's something like the number of something with specific properties in the input numbers.  \nFor instance, sum of proper divisors, or digits.  \nOr maybe it's the number of divisors but let me check output values.  \nNot obvious yet.  \nLet me maybe look at the first pair: input 13, 144, 7, 4, 21 with output 2. Maybe it's counting the prime numbers? Let me check:  \n13 is prime; 144 not. 7 is prime, 4 is composite, 21 composite.  \nBut output is 2, let's see... Maybe the number of primes? How many primes are there? 13 and 7 are primes. So that's two, which matches the output. Let me check the next.  \nIf count the primes among the numbers:  \n35 is 5*7, composite  \n225 is composite, 49 is 7 squared, composite  \n64 composite, 11 is prime.  \nSo only one prime here (11), but the output is 8. Hmm, doesn't match. Maybe a different approach.  \nAlternatively, the outputs might relate to exponents or something.  \nLet me try the number of digits, but let me count.  \nWait, output 2 is much lower than expected.  \nAnother approach: maybe it's floor of the square root or something.  \nLet's see:  \nWait 13 sqrt is about 3.6..., floor is3, not 2. Maybe floor of square root of numbers:  \nsqrt(13)=3.6→3; sqrt(144)=12; sqrt(7)=2.64→2; sqrt(4)=2; sqrt(21)=4.58→4. Maybe adding those floors: 3+12+2+2+4=23, not equal to output 2.  \nNot useful.  \nAlternatively sum the digits.  \n13->1+3=4;144->1+4+4=9; 7->7;4->4; 21->2+1=3: Sum would be 4+9+7+4+3=25? No, output is2. Doesn't align.  \nAnother idea: Maybe it's the number of divisors minus something?  \nNumber of divisors:  \nNumber like input numbers: 13 is prime, divisors 2, so d(13)=2  \n144: number of divisors: let's see prime factors 144 is 12^2= (2^4 *3^2); exponents 4,2, so (4+1)(2+1)=15 divisors  \n7 is prime, divisors=2  \n4 is 2^2, divisors=3  \n21 is 3*7, divisors=4  \nTotal sum: 2+15+2+3+4=26, not matching output2.  \nNope.  \nMaybe minimum number of something?  \nOutput is 2. Maybe counting the number of 1s but numbers seem big.  \nWait let's consider numbers in another way: exponents or differences perhaps.  \nWait another idea: Could it be related to how many squares or cubes are in the numbers? Let me see.  \n13: Not square or anything.  \n144 is 12 squared  \n7: Not  \n4=2^2  \n21= not  \nMaybe the largest square? Like 144 is 12^2, and count something.  \nBut only one largest square is 144, output 2—doesn't make.  \nLet me try a different approach. Let me see other pairs:  \nThese outputs and input numbers... Maybe it's related to the number of common factors or something.  \nLet me think what operations can take a list of numbers to a single output.  \nMaybe it's counting the number of prime numbers in the input numbers.  \nLet's test:  \nFirst input:13 is prime? Yes; 144 non prime; 7 prime;4 non;21 non. So number of primes here is 13 and7: total2. Output is2. That matches.  \nSecond Input:35 non(prime);225 non;49 (7², but still7 prime);64 non;11 is prime. So number of primes:49 is 7² but still has7 prime;11 is prime. Let's count: numbers are35,225,49,64,11. Primes:  \nWait the definition is - perhaps count the number of prime numbers in the input integers, even if the exponents.  \nInput:35: prime? No, it's composite;225: composite;49: composite;64: composite;11: prime. So primes: only11. Output is8, so doesn't match counting primes.  \nWait maybe sum the count of primes and something else maybe the count repeated?  \nWait this way getting stuck, let me try different approach.  \nThe outputs for: Op1→2 Op2→8 Op3→6 Op4→10 Op5→4 Could it be sum of (number of letters in number words?)  \nLike \"13\" eleven letters? \"twelve\" something but 13 being thirteen maybe8 letters but not too sure.  \nAlternatively, sum of numbers:  \nBut13,144, etc, but it's more likely formula.  \nWait the output could be the number of letters in 'numbers'.</think> The instruction is: Maybe the number of something specific.
