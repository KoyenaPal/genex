Let’s check the first one.  \nInput: Roses are red (A), violets are blue (B), sugar is sweet (C), and so are you (D).  \nHmm, that’s AABB? Or maybe ABAB?  \nWait, Roses are red (A), violets are blue (B), sugar is sweet (C), and so are you (D).  \nThe traditional rhyme is \"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you.\"  \nThe rhyme is AABB: A is red, B is blue, C is sweet, D is you.  \nWait, but that’s not a rhyme.  \nWait, maybe the structure is not about rhyme but about the pattern of the lines.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain nouns or verbs with others.  \nFor example, in the first input, \"Roses are red\" becomes \"Cats are black\", so roses → cats, red → black.  \nViolets → dogs, blue → brown.  \nSugar → birds, sweet → can fly.  \n\"and so are you\" → \"all around town.\"  \nSo \"you\" becomes \"town\".  \nHmm, that might not follow a clear substitution.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to create a new poem with the same structure but different content.</think> The instruction is: \"Rewrite the given set of statements with a different subject and context, maintaining similar structure and rhyme.\" \n\nEach input-output pair follows a similar transformation"

Input: A sentence about a perfect sunny day leading to going outside. The output is about a peaceful night with the moon and stars, suggesting staying in.  \n2. Rain and children playing in puddles become snow and puppies in winter.  \n3. Flowers in the garden turn into cookies in the kitchen.  \n4. A bird in a tree at evening becomes a fish in the sea.  \n5. A nursery rhyme about numbers becomes something about colors in a zoo.\n\nHmm, the first thought is that there's some kind of transformation happening between the inputs and outputs.  \nLet me analyze each pair to see what changes occur.  \nLooking at the first pair: The input mentions the sun, clear sky, perfect day, and going outside.  \nThe output talks about the moon (which is opposite to the sun), stars, peaceful night, and staying.  \nSo maybe the instruction is to invert certain elements. Like day to night, sun to moon, activities to their opposites?  \nSecond input: Raindrops, puddles, children splashing.  \nOutput is snowflakes, winter (so cold vs rain's wet), puppies playing.  \nSo rain to snow, which is a precipitation type opposite?  \nOr maybe weather opposites.  \nThird input: Garden, flowers, colors, perfume.  \nOutput is kitchen, cookies, flavors.  \nSo nature to cooking?  \nFlowers to cookies?  \nMaybe transforming natural scenes into domestic settings.  \nFourth input: Bird in a tree, singing, evening star.  \nOutput is fish in the sea, waves, ocean floor.  \nSo birds to fish, trees to sea?  \nOr maybe different habitats.  \nFifth input: Nursery rhyme numbers to colors in a zoo.  \nNumbers to colors, and maybe the setting shifts from a home scene to a zoo.  \n\nAnother angle: Maybe each line of the input is being transformed into a line of the output, but not word-for-word.  \nLet's check line by line.  \nFor example, first input's lines: \"The sun is bright\" becomes \"The moon is white\" – so sun to moon, bright to white.  \nThen \"the sky is clear\" becomes \"the stars appear\" – sky clear might lead to stars appearing.  \n\"Today is such a perfect day\" becomes \"tonight is such a peaceful way\".  \nSo day to night, perfect day to peaceful night.  \n\"Let's go outside and play\" becomes \"to rest our heads and stay\".  \nSo going outside to staying inside.  \nSo it's like a transformation from day to night, and activities opposite.  \n\nSimilarly, second input: Rain to snow, puddles to snowflakes, children to puppies, playing to barking.  \n\nThird input: flowers to cookies, garden to kitchen, bloom to loom (maybe a play on words?), sweet perfume to flavors.  \n\nFourth input: bird to fish, tree to sea, singing to swimming, songs to graceful movement, evening star to ocean floor.  \n\nFifth input: numbers to colors, rhyme structure to zoo-related.  \n\nAnother thought: Maybe each element is being replaced with its antonym or related concept.  \nFor example, sun (day) → moon (night).  \nRain → snow.  \nBird → fish.  \nFlowers → cookies.  \nNumbers → colors.  \nSo perhaps the instruction is to replace each noun with its antonym or related concept in a different context.  \nBut how does this apply to the entire sentence?  \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about transforming the scene into its opposite or a contrasting scenario.  \nFor example, each line's subject and activity are swapped with another.  \n\nLet me see the structure of the inputs and outputs.  \nThe first input has four parts, each separated by commas.  \nThe output also has four parts with commas.  \nThe same structure.  \nSo perhaps each part is transformed individually.  \nLet's take the first input's parts:  \n1. The sun is bright.  \n2. The sky is clear.  \n3. Today is such a perfect day.  \n4. Let's go outside and play.\n\nThe output:  \n1. The moon is white.  \n2. The stars appear.  \n3. Tonight is such a peaceful way.  \n4. To rest our heads and stay.\n\nSo each part is being altered.  \nFor example, \"sun\" to \"moon\", \"bright\" to \"white\", \"sky\" to \"stars\", \"clear\" to \"appear\",  \n\"today\" to \"tonight\", \"perfect day\" to \"peaceful way\", \"go outside and play\" to \"rest our heads and stay\".  \nSo the instruction might be to replace each noun with its antonym or a related concept, adjusting adjectives and verbs to fit the new context.  \n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs seem to mirror the inputs but in a different setting (day vs night, garden vs kitchen, etc.), with some rhyming or alliteration.  \nLet's check the rhyming.  \nFor example, the first output: \"The moon is white, the stars appear, tonight is such a peaceful way, to rest our heads and stay.\" The words \"white\" and \"appear\" don't rhyme, but \"way\" and \"stay\" do.  \nThe second output: \"Snow flakes call, winter's norm, puppies dash and bark with spree.\" \"Call\" and \"norm\" don't rhyme, but \"dash\" and \"spree\" maybe not.  \nThe third: \"cookies loom, flavors rich and warm consume.\" Loom and consume – no rhyme.  \nFourth: \"dancing waves from shore to shore, by the sandy ocean floor.\" Rhyming shore/shore and floor.  \nFifth: \"Red blue color my zoo, green white paint the sight, dark bright make it right.\" Colors and sight, right.  \nHmm, maybe not consistent.  \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to create a parallel structure where each element is replaced with a similar-sounding word.  \nFor instance, \"sun\" to \"moon\", \"bright\" to \"white\", \"sky\" to \"stars\", \"clear\" to \"appear\",  \n\"today\" to \"tonight\", \"perfect day\" to \"peaceful way\", \"go outside\" to \"rest our heads\", \"play\" to \"stay\".  \nThe words are similar in sound or meaning.  \nSo the instruction might be to substitute each noun with its antonym or a related word, adjusting adjectives and verbs to fit the new context.  \n\nAnother observation: The outputs often end with a verb phrase that's a contrast to the input's.  \nFor example, \"go outside and play\" becomes \"rest our heads and stay\".  \nSimilarly, \"children splash and laugh\" becomes \"puppies dash and bark\", which are active actions but with different subjects.  \nThe third input's output changes \"bloom\" to \"loom\", which is a homophone, and \"perfume\" to \"consume\", which are rhyming words.  \nSo maybe the instruction includes replacing words with homophones or rhymes.  \nBut that seems too vague.  \n\nBut in the first example, \"today\" becomes \"tonight\", so changing \"today\" to \"tonight\" directly.  \nBut in the second input, \"Rain drops fall\" becomes \"Snow flakes call\". So maybe replacing the type of precipitation.  \nThe second part of the input, \"children splash and laugh with glee\" becomes \"puppies dash and bark with spree\".  \nSo children to puppies, splashing to dashing, laughing to barking.  \nSo maybe animals that are typically associated with certain seasons or times.  \nThe third input: \"garden flowers bloom\" becomes \"kitchen cookies loom\".  \nBloom to loom, which is a homophone, and \"perfume\" to \"consume\", which are rhyming words.  \nSo scents to tastes.  \nThe fourth input: \"Little bird upon the tree\" becomes \"Little fish within the sea\".  \nSo bird to fish, tree to sea.  \nThe fifth input: \"One two buckle my shoe\" becomes \"Red blue color my zoo\".  \nNumbers to colors, and the action of buckling to coloring.  \nAlso, \"shut the door\" to \"paint the sight\", \"pick up sticks\" to \"make it right\".</think> The instruction is: Transform each part of the input sentence by substituting nouns and verbs with their opposite counterparts in a different context, such as changing \"sun\" to \""

The user provided five input-output examples where each input is a poem or a sentence about something, and the output is another poem with similar structure but different content.  \nLet me look at each pair carefully.  \nFirst, let's analyze the first input-output pair.  \nThe input describes a man from Peru who dreamed of a kangaroo, and the output is about a cat from Maine.  \nBoth have a similar structure: \"There once was a [animal] from [place], who [verb phrase], [action], [action], and [result].\"  \nLooking at the second example: the input is about a funny old bear who loved to dance, and the output is about a clever young fox.  \nThe structure is similar again.  \nThe third input is a rabbit in a garden, output is a horse in a meadow.  \nFourth: mouse vs bird.  \nFifth: ocean vs mountain.  \nBut what's the exact rule? Let me check the rhymes.  \nThe first input's rhyme scheme is AABBA.  \nThe output's rhyme scheme is also AABBA.  \nFor example, input lines 1: Peru (A), kangaroo (A), start (B), heart (B), true (A).  \nOutput: Maine (A), rain (A), sound (B), pain (A).  \nWait, no, let me check again.  \nInput lines: \"Peru\", \"kangaroo\", \"start\", \"heart\", \"true\".  \nRhyme scheme: A, A, B, B, A.  \nOutput : \"Maine\", \"rain\", \"sound\", \"pain\", \"dream had come true\" which is \"true\" again.  \nSo output's rhyme is A, A, B, B, A.  \nSo the structure is maintained.  \nSimilarly, other outputs follow the same rhyme pattern.  \nBut how exactly? Let's see the first input starts with \"There once was a man from Peru\", output starts with \"There once was a cat from Maine\".  \nSo replacing \"man\" with \"cat\", \"Peru\" with \"Maine\".  \nThen \"who dreamed of a kangaroo\" becomes \"who loved to dance in the rain\".  \nSo the second line's verb phrase changes.  \nThe third line: \"he woke with a start\" becomes \"she twirled around, without a sound\".  \nThe fourth line: \"clutched his beating heart\" becomes \"then dried off without any pain\".  \nThe last line: \"and realized his dream had come true\" becomes \"and realized his dream had come true\".</think> The instruction is: \"There once was a man from Peru, who dreamed of a kangaroo, he woke with a start, clutched his beating heart,"

Both are vehicles, one flying, the other sailing.  \nThe second input is dandelion seeds (which float) and the output is maple keys, which also spin in the air.  \nSo maybe the instruction was to come up with a poem that parallels the input's theme but with a different object or concept.  \nLooking at the third input: bicycle wheels spinning, output is skateboard rolling. Both are related to movement, but different modes of transport.  \nThe fourth input is a picnic blanket, output is a beach towel. Both are items used outdoors, but different settings.  \nThe fifth input is a hammock, output is a porch swing. Both are things that swing or sway, but in different locations.  \nHmm, so the instruction might be to take the first input (which is a poem) and generate a poem that uses a similar structure but replaces the central object or activity with a related one.  \nLet me check the structure.  \nEach input is four lines, and the outputs also four lines.  \nThe rhyming scheme seems to be AABB for each quatrain.  \nFor example, input 1: \"soars up high\" and \"cloudy sky\" rhyme; \"wind's reply\" and \"floats on by\" rhyme.  \nThe outputs follow the same pattern.  \nSo maybe the instruction was to write a poem that has the same rhyme scheme and structure as the input but with a different subject.  \nBut more specifically, each output seems to replace the main noun from the input with another related noun.  \nLike paper airplane → wooden sailboat, dandelion seeds → maple keys, bicycle wheels → skateboard, picnic blanket → beach towel, hammock → porch swing.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform the input poem by changing the subject to another related object while keeping the structure.  \nLet me check if there are more clues.  \nFor example, the first input mentions \"racing through the cloudy sky,\" and the output talks about \"dancing like it's feeling brave.\"  \nThe verbs change from \"races\" to \"dances,\" but the overall movement idea remains.  \nSimilarly, the second input's \"floating on the breeze\" becomes \"twirling without any care.\"  \nSo maybe the instruction was to rewrite the poem using a different object but maintaining the same poetic elements—rhyme, meter, and the theme of movement or action.  \nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all start with a noun phrase (wooden sailboat, maple keys, skateboard, etc.), followed by actions that mirror the input's verbs but in a different context.  \nFor example, \"rides the wave\" vs. \"soars up high.\"  \nThe outputs also seem to keep the same number of syllables per line.  \nLet me count syllables for the first input and output.  \nInput 1: \"Paper airplane soars up high\" (7 syllables), \"racing through the cloudy sky\" (7), \"carried by the wind's reply\" (7), \"watching as it floats on by\" (8).  \nOutput 1: \"Wooden sailboat rides the wave\" (7), \"dancing like it's feeling brave\" (7), \"rocking in the water's cave\" (7), \"memories that time will save\" (8).  \nSo the syllable count matches.  \nThe outputs have the same number of syllables per line as the inputs.  \nSo the instruction might require maintaining the same syllable count and rhyme scheme while changing the subject to a related item.  \nLet me check if there's a pattern in the substitutions:  \n- Paper airplane (air) → Wooden sailboat (water)  \n- Dandelion seeds (plants) → Maple keys (trees)  \n- Bicycle wheels (ground) → Skateboard (ground)  \n- Picnic blanket (grass) → Beach towel (sand)  \n- Hammock (sway) → Porch swing (swing)  \nSo each substitution moves from one element (sky, air, plants, ground, shade) to another (water, trees, ground, sand, swing).  \nNot sure if there's a direct pattern, but maybe the instruction was to replace the main object with another object that moves in a different environment but in a similar way.  \nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to write a poem that uses the same structure but changes the subject to a different object that shares a similar dynamic or purpose.  \nFor instance, all outputs are about objects that move freely (sailboat, maple keys, skateboard, etc.), so maybe the instruction was to write a poem about a different object that also moves freely, keeping the same structure.  \nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take the first line's subject and replace it with another object that can move in a similar way or serve a similar purpose.  \nFor instance, a paper airplane flies, so a sailboat sails. A dandelion seed floats, so a maple key spins. A bicycle wheel spins, so a skateboard rolls. A picnic blanket is spread, so a beach towel is laid out. A hammock sways, so a porch swing moves.  \nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to create a poem that \"mirrors\" the input's structure and theme but with a different subject.</think> The instruction is: \"Write a poem about a moving object, using different subjects while maintaining the same structure and rhyme scheme as the given examples.\"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Input: Tiger (predator, night) Output: Eagle (predator, day)  \n2. Waterfall (water feature, night? ) Output: Mountain stream (water feature, day?)  \n3. Telescope (looking up) vs Microscope (looking down)  \n4. L ighthouse (sea) vs Campfire (land)  \n5. Dragonfly (insect) vs Hummingbird (bird)  \n\nFor example, if the input is about a tiger in the night, the output is about an eagle in the day.  \nIf the input is about a waterfall, the output is about a mountain stream, which is a different water feature.  \nThe third pair is about telescopes vs microscopes, which are opposites in terms of scale.  \nThe fourth pair is lighthouse vs campfire, both sources of light but different contexts.  \nThe fifth pair is dragonfly vs hummingbird, both flying insects but different types.</think> The instruction is: \"An eagle soaring through the day, with feathers of brown, white, and grey, searching for its golden prey, gracefully flying in its flight.\""
