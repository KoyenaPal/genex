For first: 13,144,7,4,21 output 2.  \nmaybe count of squares? 144 is 12^2. 7 not. 4 is 2^2. 13,21 not. So squares count=2 maybe? Actually 144 and 4 are squares => count=2. That matches output 2.  \nNext: 35,225,49,64,11. Squares: 225=15^2,49=7^2,64=8^2. That's 3 squares. Output is 8 not 3.  \nMaybe sum of square roots? sqrt225=15, sqrt49=7, sqrt64=8 sum=30. output 8 not 30.  \nMaybe number of prime numbers? Let's test: 35 composite,225 composite,49 composite,64 composite,11 prime => count 1->output8 no.  \n\nMaybe output is sum of digits of squares? Not.  \n\nLet's analyze other rows: 27,10,43,36,33. Squares: 36 only. count=1 output6 not1.  \n\nRow4: 39,169,25,100,31. Squares: 169 (13^2),25(5^2),100(10^2). count=3 output10.  \n\nRow5: 17,121,45,16,23. Squares:121(11^2),16(4^2). count=2 output4.  \n\nPattern: output maybe sum of square roots of square numbers? For row1 roots:12+2=14 -> output2 maybe sum digits 1+4=5 no.  \nRow2 roots:15+7+8=30 -> output8 maybe digits sum 3+0=3 no.  \nRow3 roots:6 -> output6 matches.  \nRow4 roots:13+5+10=28 -> output10 maybe digits 2+8=10?? no.  \n\nMaybe output equals count of prime numbers? We tried.  \n\nMaybe output equals count of letters in something? hmm.  \n\nCheck if output equals count of even numbers? Row1 evens:144,4,21? 21 odd. So 2 evens->output2 matches.  \nRow2 evens:225 odd,49 odd,64 even,35 odd,11 odd =>1 even -> output8 no.  \n\nMaybe output equals number of prime factors? Not.  \n\nCheck maybe output equals number of letters when write numbers in words? 13=thirteen(8 letters). 144=one hundred forty-four (?), 7=seven (5),4=four (4),21=twenty one (??). Maybe sum maybe 2? unclear.  \n\nMaybe output equals the difference between largest and smallest?

Check second: numbers: 47, 196, 23, 36, 17. 196’s √ is 14, 36 √6. Output is 6. So output equals √ of number that is perfect square? Which is 36 √6. Check third: 81 √9, 64 √8 → output 8.
