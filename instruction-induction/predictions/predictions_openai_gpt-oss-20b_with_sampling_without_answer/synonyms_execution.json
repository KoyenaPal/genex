Not obvious. Commend means praise or approval. Remember?? maybe 'to commend someone' = 'to praise someone. 'remember' sounds like 'remember', maybe 'recall praise'?? Maybe 'commend' -> 'remember' because 'to commend' = 'to recommend'? 'recommend' similar to 'remember'? But 'recommend' synonyms: 'commend'. 'remember' synonyms: 'recall'. Hmm 'record' no. 'remember' maybe a mistake? Wait could be 'remem-...' I'm trying to see a pattern: Maybe instruction: transform a word to a synonym that is shorter? Not: excessively -> too (shorter). leadership -> leading (maybe more specific). art -> prowess (synonym). recommend -> remember?? No.\n\naccomplished -> complete.
