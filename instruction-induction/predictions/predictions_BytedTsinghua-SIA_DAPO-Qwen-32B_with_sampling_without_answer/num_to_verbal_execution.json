The number is separated into thousands and hundreds.\n2. For numbers greater than or equal to 1000, it starts with expressing the thousands part followed by comma and then the rest.\n3. When the hundreds place is more than 0, we use \"hundred and\" if there are any tens or units, or just \"hundred\" if it ends in \"00\".\n4. No \"and\" is inserted after the thousands or hundreds if the number is composed only of thousands and units or tens without a hundreds place.\n\nNow let me write the instruction for this task.\n\nInstruction: Convert the given number (in numeral form) to its corresponding written form in English, using the appropriate rules for expressing thousands, hundreds, and tens/units, including the use of commas and \"and\" where necessary.\n\nLet's apply this instruction to a new input to demonstrate.\n\nWe will convert 6840 into words step by step:\n\n1. Separate the number into thousands and the rest.\n   - Thousands part: 6\n   - The hundreds, tens and units part: 840.\n\nNow we convert each part:\n\nCombining these parts together using the rule that we use a comma between the thousands and the rest, and if the number after the thousands is above zero, we add \"and\" appropriately for the structure,\n\nIf you had another number, let's say 1600, here's how you would apply the rule.\n\n- We have 1 thousand and 600.\n\nWe will combine them. For numbers ending in \"00,\" after the thousands, no \"and\" is required between thousands and the following number.\n\nGiven the rule from the inputs such as \"4047\" resulting in \"four thousand and forty-seven\", we can see numbers have special treatment.\n\nFinally, let's take one more number, such as 2005.\n\n- The number has the thousands part as 2 (two thousand)\n- The remaining part is 005, which is just \"five.\"\n\nTo conclude, the instruction is to convert numbers to their written English form, observing the placement of commas, \"and,\" and ensuring proper naming conventions for thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.</think> The instruction is: Convert the given numeral into its written English form. Make sure to use commas and the word \"and\" where appropriate to match typical English number reading conventions"
