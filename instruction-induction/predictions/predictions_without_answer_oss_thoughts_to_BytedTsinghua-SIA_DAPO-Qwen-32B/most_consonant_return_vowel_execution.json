We have 5 items each. Output numbers: 1,3,4,2,3. We need to find rule. Let's analyze each list.\n\nList1: apple, banana, orange, grape, cherry. Output 1. Maybe count of letters that are vowels? Let's compute: apple(2 vowels a e), banana(3 a a a), orange(3 o a e), grape(2 a e), cherry(2 e e). Total vowels 2+3+3+2+2=12. Not 1.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that are repeated? Not.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that are unique across all words? Not.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that are common to all words? Let's check: common letters across all words: apple, banana, orange, grape, cherry. Intersection? apple letters: a,p,l,e. banana: b,a,n. orange: o,r,a,n,g,e. grape: g,r,a,p,e. cherry: c,h,e,r,r,y. Intersection: only 'a'? apple has a, banana has a, orange has a, grape has a, cherry does not have a. So none. So 0.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that appear in all words? 0.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that appear in at least two words? Let's compute for list1: letters across words: apple: a,p,l,e. banana: b,a,n. orange: o,r,a,n,g,e. grape: g,r,a,p,e. cherry: c,h,e,r,r,y. Count letters that appear in at least two words: a appears in apple, banana, orange, grape.

The friend outputs a number for each list of five words. The numbers vary: 4,3,4,4,2. Likely count of something common among words. Maybe number of letters that are vowels? Let's test: \"complicated\" has vowels: o,i,a,e? Actually complicated: o,i,a,e? Wait letters: c o m p l i c a t e d. Vowels: o,i,a,e =4. \"sophisticated\": o,i,a,i,e =5? Actually s o p h i s t i c a t e d: vowels o,i,i,a,e =5. \"concentrated\": o,e,e,a,e =5. \"integrated\": i,e,i,a,e =5. \"coordinated\": o,o,i,a,e =5. So not all 4. So output 4 maybe count of words that have exactly 4 vowels? Let's check: \"complicated\" has 4 vowels. Others have 5. So only 1 word with 4 vowels. Output 4 not 1. So not that.\n\nMaybe number of letters that are symmetrical? Or number of letters that are repeated? Let's analyze each list.\n\nList1: complicated, sophisticated, concentrated, integrated, coordinated. Output 4. Maybe count of words that contain the letter 'c'? All have c? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated yes, coordinated yes. That's 5. Not 4.\n\nMaybe count of words that contain letter 't'? All have t? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated yes, coordinated yes. 5 again.\n\nMaybe count of words that have more than 10 letters? Let's count lengths: complicated (11), sophisticated (13), concentrated (12), integrated (10), coordinated (10). So 3 words >10? Actually 3 words >10: complicated, sophisticated, concentrated. Output 4. Not.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have at least one double letter? \"coordinated\" has 'oo', \"concentrated\" has 'nn'? Actually 'concentrated' has 'nn'? No. \"integrated\" no double. \"complicated\" no double. \"sophisticated\" no double. So only 1. Not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'a'? All have a? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated yes, coordinated yes. That's 5, not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'e'? All have e? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated yes, coordinated yes. 5.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'i'? All have i? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated yes, coordinated yes. 5.\n\nSo output 4 maybe count of words that have letter 'c' but not 'coordinated'? Wait 'coordinated' has c? yes. So 5.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'o'? All have o? complicated yes, sophisticated yes, concentrated yes, integrated no 'o', coordinated yes. So 4. That matches output 4. Let's test with second list: beautiful, powerful, colorful, wonderful, peaceful. Count words with letter 'o': beautiful no 'o', powerful yes, colorful yes, wonderful yes, peaceful no 'o'. That's 3. Output 3. Good! Third list: dictionary, vocabulary, necessary, secretary, temporary. Count words with 'o': dictionary yes, vocabulary yes, necessary no, secretary no, temporary no. That's 2, but output 4. So fails.\n\nMaybe letter 'a'? Count words with 'a': dictionary no, vocabulary yes, necessary yes, secretary yes, temporary yes. That's 4. Output 4. Good! So maybe rule: count words containing letter 'a'? Let's test first list: complicated has a, yes; sophisticated has a, yes; concentrated has a, yes; integrated has a, yes; coordinated has a, yes. That's 5, not 4. So fails.\n\nMaybe letter 'e'? Count words with 'e': dictionary yes, vocabulary no, necessary yes, secretary yes, temporary no. That's 3, not 4.\n\nMaybe letter 'i'? Count words with 'i': dictionary yes, vocabulary no, necessary no, secretary no, temporary no. That's 1, not 4.\n\nMaybe letter 'o' again? For third list: dictionary has o, yes; vocabulary has o, yes; necessary no; secretary no; temporary no. That's 2, not 4.\n\nSo not letter presence.\n\nMaybe count of words that have letter 'a' or 'e' or 'i' etc? Let's analyze each list.\n\nList1 output 4. Which words maybe share a property? Let's examine each word's number of distinct letters? Or maybe number of letters that are symmetrical vertically? Hard.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that are common between all words? Let's find common letters across all five words in list1. Let's compute intersection: complicated letters: c o m p l i c a t e d. Sophisticated: s o p h i s t i c a t e d. Concentrated: c o n c e n t r a t e d. Integrated: i n t e g r a t e d. Coordinated: c o o r d i n a t e d. Intersection: letters present in all: Let's find: 'c' appears in all? yes. 'o' appears in all? yes. 't' appears in all? yes. 'e' appears in all? yes. 'd' appears in all? yes. 'a' appears in all? yes. 'i' appears in all? yes? integrated has i, yes. coordinated has i, yes. concentrated has i? no. So 'i' not in all. 'n' appears in all? no. So intersection letters: c, o, t, e, d, a. That's 6 letters. Output 4 not 6.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters that appear in at least 4 words? Let's count each letter frequency across words. But output 4 maybe number of letters that appear in exactly 4 words? Let's test quickly: letter 'c' appears in all 5. 'o' appears in all 5. 't' appears in all 5. 'e' appears in all 5. 'd' appears in all 5. 'a' appears in all 5. So 6 letters appear in all 5. So not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have more than 10 letters? For list1: complicated 11, sophisticated 13, concentrated 12, integrated 10, coordinated 10. So 3 words >10. Output 4. Not.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have at least one double letter? Only coordinated has 'oo', maybe also 'concentrated' has 'nn'? Actually 'concentrated' has 'nn'? No. So 1. Not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'c' at the start? None start with c? Actually complicated starts with c, yes. sophisticated starts with s. concentrated starts with c. integrated starts with i. coordinated starts with c. So 3. Not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'c' somewhere? All 5. Not 4.\n\nMaybe output is number of words that have letter 'o' somewhere? 4 (all except integrated). That matches list1. List2: beautiful (no o), powerful (o), colorful (o), wonderful (o), peaceful (no o). That's 3. Output 3. List3: dictionary (o), vocabulary (o), necessary (no o), secretary (no o), temporary (no o). That's 2. Output 4.
