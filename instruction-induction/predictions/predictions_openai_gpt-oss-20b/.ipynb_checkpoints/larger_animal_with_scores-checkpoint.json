But poodle is not a bird, elk is not a bird, so both not birds. So rule fails.\n\nCould be choose the one that is not a bird or fish? But poodle is not a bird or fish, elk is not a bird or fish.

Elk is larger than poodle. So output elk. Good.\n\nNow pair 5: hummingbird (bird) vs chimpanzee (mammal). Choose mammal: chimpanzee. Good.\n\nSo the rule fits all.\n\nBut is there any other rule that could produce same outputs? For example, choose the one that is not a bird or fish or invertebrate? That would pick chamois, sperm whale, cougar, elk, chimpanzee. But for pair 4, both not birds or fish or invertebrates.

So we will output the instruction.\n\nBut we need to consider the instruction might be something else. Let's double-check if there is any other pattern: maybe choose the animal that is not a bird or fish or amphibian or reptile or invertebrate. That would pick chamois, sperm whale, cougar, elk, chimpanzee. But pair 4 fails. So no.\n\nMaybe choose the animal that is not a bird or fish or amphibian or reptile or invertebrate or insect.
