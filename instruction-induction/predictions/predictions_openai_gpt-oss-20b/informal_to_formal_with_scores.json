The outputs are more formal, more elaborate, sometimes using synonyms, sometimes changing structure. Let's analyze each pair.\n\n1. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a transformation: question to a more formal question. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" -> \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the instruction might be \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal way, using more formal vocabulary and structure.\" The output uses \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a more formal way of asking if the speaker should accompany the other. So yes.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is also a more formal expression of gratitude. So \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style.\"\n\n3. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This is a more formal version: \"can't\" -> \"cannot\", \"stand\" -> \"tolerate\". So again, rewrite in a more formal style.\n\n4. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" This is a more formal way: \"got\" -> \"understood\". So again, rewrite in a more formal style.\n\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" This is a more formal relative pronoun: \"I met\" -> \"whom I met\". So again, rewrite in a more formal style.\n\nThus the instruction is likely: \"Rewrite the following sentence in a more formal style.\" Or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone.\" Or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal way.\" The instruction might also include \"Use more formal language\" or \"Use more formal vocabulary.\" The instruction might be \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal

The outputs are paraphrases, more formal, more elaborate. They change wording: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" -> \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Slightly more formal. \"I think that this is interesting.\" -> \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" \"The whole story was made up.\" -> \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"See you tonight.\" -> \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" \"Do you want me to go with you?\" -> \"Shall I accompany you?\" So instruction likely: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal way\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal manner\" or \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style, using more sophisticated vocabulary.\" The outputs also use synonyms: whole->entire, made up->fabricated, see you->look forward to meeting you, do you want me to go with you?->Shall I accompany you? So instruction: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style, using more sophisticated vocabulary.\" So answer: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style.\" Let's produce that.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style, using more sophisticated vocabulary and phrasing.<|return|>",
