Observing mapping: English to Spanish? cloth->trapo (Spanish word for cloth is \"tela\" or \"trapo\" meaning rag). stunt->proeza (Spanish for stunt is \"proeza\" or \"hazaña\"). violence->violencia same. group->grupo same. explosion->explosión same. So instruction likely: translate English word to Spanish, but use a specific form? For cloth, they used \"trapo\" instead of \"tela\". For stunt, \"proeza\" instead of \"hazaña\". So maybe instruction: \"Translate the word into Spanish, but if there are multiple translations, choose the one that is a noun meaning a specific type of object or action.\" Or maybe \"Translate into Spanish, but use the word that is a noun that is a synonym but not the most common.\" But the instruction might be: \"Translate the word into Spanish, but if the word has multiple translations, choose the one that is a noun that is a synonym but not the most common.\" But we need to produce the instruction. The instruction likely: \"Translate the following English word into Spanish, using the most common noun translation.\" But cloth->tela is common, but they used trapo. So maybe instruction: \"Translate into Spanish, but use the word that is a noun that is a synonym but not the most common.\" But why choose trapo? Maybe because the friend is Spanish speaker and uses \"trapo\" for cloth? But \"trapo\" is more like rag. But maybe the instruction: \"Translate into Spanish, but use the word that is a noun that is a synonym but not the most common.\" But for violence, they used violencia same. For group, grupo same. For explosion, explosión same. So only cloth and stunt had alternative translations.
