So instruction likely: \"Translate the English word into German, but if the German word is the same as English, keep it.\" But layout->Einteilung is not direct translation; layout in German is \"Layout\" or \"Anordnung\". But they gave \"Einteilung\" meaning classification. So maybe instruction: \"Translate the word into German, but if the word is a noun that is also used in German, keep it.\" But layout is not same. So maybe instruction: \"Translate the word into German, but if the word is a noun that is also used in German, keep it.\" But layout is not same. So maybe instruction: \"Translate the word into German, but if the word is a noun that is also used in German, keep it.\" That would keep console, propaganda. But layout is not same, so translate. trait->Eigenschaft. baptism->Taufe. So instruction: \"Translate the English word into German, but if the word is also used in German, keep it.\" That seems plausible. But maybe instruction: \"Translate the word into German, but if the word is a noun that is also used in German, keep it.\" That matches.
