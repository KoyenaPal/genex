I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the inputs into outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 29 29, Output: 58\n2. Input: 20 68, Output: 88\n3. Input: 43 51, Output: 94\n4. Input: 37 49, Output: 86\n5. Input: 5 8, Output: 13\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLooking at the first pair: Input (29, 29) gives Output 58. Let's see possible operations:\n\n- Sum: 29 + 29 = 58. That works here.\n- Maybe a + b? Let's check the next ones.\n\nSecond input: (20, 68) gives 88. Let's see: 20 + 68 = 88. That also works.\n\nThird input: (43, 51) gives 94. 43 + 51 = 94. Yep, same result.\n\nFourth input: (37, 49) gives 86. Let's check: 37 + 49 = 86. Yes, that works too.\n\nFifth input: (5, 8) gives 13. 5 + 8 = 13. Perfect, that also works.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all outputs:\n\n1. 29 + 29 = 58 ✔️\n2. 20 + 68 = 88 ✔️\n3. 43 + 51 = 94 ✔️\n4. 37 + 49 = 86 ✔️\n5. 5 + 8 = 13 ✔️\n\nSo it seems consistent. Maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 29*2 = 58? Wait, 29*2 is 58, but second input: 20* something? 20*4.4=88? Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 29 and 29 make 2929, but 2929 is way bigger than 58. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, subtracting? 29 - 29 = 0, no. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 29*2=58, yes, 2*29=58. Let's check the next input: 20 and 68. 20* something? 20*4.4=88? Doesn't fit a simple pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two numbers multiplied by something? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 29 +29 =58, output is 58. So maybe it's just the sum.\n\nSecond input: 20 +68=88, which is the output. Third: 43 +51=94, which is the output. Fourth: 37 +49=86, which is the output. Fifth:5 +8=13, which is the output.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers in each input.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably to add the two numbers given.\n\nLet me just verify each:\n\n1. 29 +29 =58 ✅\n2. 20 +68=88 ✅\n3. 43 +51=94 ✅\n4. 37 +49=86 ✅\n5. 5 +8=13 ✅\n\nYes, all match. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: take the two numbers and add them together.\n\nSo the instruction is probably \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible pattern. Maybe it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's check the last one: 5 and 8 sum to 13, which is correct. 5+8=13.\n\nSo yes, it's consistently the sum.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an operation, it's the sum of the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the rule is a + b = c.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

So, we have four pairs:\n\n1. Input: 52 68, Output: 120\n2. Input: 61 96, Output: 157\n3. Input: 14 95, Output: 109\n4. Input: 12 96, Output: 108\n5. Input: 26 58, Output: 84\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. 52 68 → 120\n2. 61 96 → 157\n3. 14 95 → 109\n4. 12 96 → 108\n5. 26 58 → 84\n\nHmm, let's consider possible operations. Maybe it's something like multiplication or addition or some formula.\n\nLet me look for a pattern. Maybe it's a function of the two numbers a and b resulting in some combination.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=52, b=68 → c=120\n2. a=61, b=96 → c=157\n3. a=14, b=95 → c=109\n4. a=12, b=96 → c=108\n5. a=26, b=58 → c=84\n\nLet me try different operations:\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a sum: a + b? 52+68=120. Hey, that's the first output! Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 61 + 96 = 157, which matches the second output. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 14 + 95 = 109, which matches the third output. Fourth input: 12 + 96 = 108, which is the fourth output. Fifth input: 26 + 58 = 84. Wait, 26 + 58 is indeed 84. So all these outputs match the sum of the two numbers!\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify:\n\nFirst input: 52 + 68 = 120, which is the output. Second: 61 + 96 = 157, correct. Third: 14 + 95 = 109, correct. Fourth: 12 + 96 = 108, correct. Fifth: 26 + 58 = 84, correct.\n\nSo it seems the instruction is simply adding the two input numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \"sum the two numbers.\"\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 52*68 = 3536, which is not 120. So nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 52*68=3536, which is way larger than 120. Not likely.\n\nWhat about a formula like a^b or something? 52^something? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by b minus something. Let's try:\n\nFor first input: 52*68 = 3536. 3536 minus something? 3536 - 2336 = 120? Wait, 3536 - 120* something? Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if it's a combination like a squared plus b or something.\n\n52^2 = 2704, 68^2=4624. 2704 + 4624 is way more than 120. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n120, 157, 109, 108, 84.\n\nIs there another relation? Maybe it's a function like a* something plus b* something.\n\nLet me consider linear combination: c = p*a + q*b.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor first input: 52p + 68q = 120\n\nSecond: 61p + 96q = 157\n\nThird: 14p +95q = 109\n\nFourth: 12p +96q = 108\n\nFifth:26p +58q =84\n\nWe can try solving these equations to find p and q.\n\nBut this might take time. Let's try the first two equations:\n\nEquation 1: 52p +68q = 120\n\nEquation 2:61p +96q =157\n\nLet me solve for p and q.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 61 and equation 2 by 52:\n\nWait, maybe use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 61:\n\n52*61 p +68*61 q = 120*61\n\n3172p + 4148q = 7320\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 52:\n\n61*52 p +96*52 q =157*52\n\n3172p + 4992q = 8164\n\nSubtract first modified equation from the second:\n\n(3172p + 4992q) - (3172p + 4148q) = 8164 -7320\n\n(0p) + 844q = 844\n\nThus 844q = 844 => q=1\n\nThen plug back into equation 1:\n\n52p +68*1=120\n\n52p +68=120\n\n52p=52\n\np=1\n\nSo p=1, q=1. Let's check if this works for the third input:\n\n14*1 +95*1= 14+95=109. Which matches the output. Good.\n\nCheck fourth input:12*1 +96*1=108. Output is 108. Correct.\n\nFifth input:26*1 +58*1=26+58=84. Output is 84. Correct.\n\nWow! So the formula is c = a + b. Because p=1 and q=1, so c = 1*a +1*b = a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\nFirst input:52 +68=120. Correct.\n\nSecond:61+96=157. Correct.\n\nThird:14+95=109. Correct.\n\nFourth:12+96=108. Correct.\n\nFifth:26+58=84. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum them.

Input: 12 50, Output: 62\n5. Input: 23 23, Output: 46\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLooking for a pattern between a, b and c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=13, b=79, c=92\n2. a=36, b=36, c=72\n3. a=3, b=89, c=92\n4. a=12, b=50, c=62\n5. a=23, b=23, c=46\n\nI need to find a function or rule that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst, let's look for a simple arithmetic operation. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else.\n\nLet me check if it's a sum: a + b? Let's see:\n\n1. 13 +79=92. Oh! That's the first output. So 13+79=92.

Also matches.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 13 +79 = 92 ✔️\n2. 36 +36 =72 ✔️\n3. 3 +89=92 ✔️\n4. 12 +50=62 ✔️\n5. 23 +23=46 ✔️\n\nWow, all outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's a different combination like a multiplied by something or b multiplied or something else.\n\nLet me check multiplication:\n\n1. 13*79=1027, which is not 92. So no.\n\nSubtraction: 79-13=66 ≠92? Wait, 92 is bigger. Maybe 13* something? 13*7=91, close but not 92.\n\nAlternatively, 79 - something? 79 - 13* something? Maybe 13*7=91, plus 1 is 92. But that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, 13* something plus something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a function like a multiplied by b divided by something? Let's check:\n\n1. 13*79=1027, divided by something? 1027 / something =92. 1027 / 11.3 something, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, 13* something else. 13*7=91, close to 92. Maybe 13*7 +1=92. But then input b is 79, not 7. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a + b - something. 13 +79=92, so maybe it's just a + b. That works for all.\n\nLet me check the second input: 36 +36=72, which is the output. Third input: 3 +89=92, same as first. Fourth:12 +50=62, which is 62. Fifth:23 +23=46.

I have four input-output pairs:\n\n1. Input: 69 95, Output: 164\n2. Input: 30 36, Output: 66\n3. Input: 4 43, Output: 47\n4. Input: 6 70, Output: 76\n5. Input: 50 70, Output: 120\n\nI need to find the instruction or rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. 69 and 95 give 164\n2. 30 and 36 give 66\n3. 4 and 43 give 47\n4. 6 and 70 give 76\n5. 50 and 70 give 120\n\nHmm, let's consider possible operations. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, something else.\n\nLet me look for a pattern. Maybe it's a function f(a, b) = something.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFirst pair: 69 and 95 → 164\n\nSecond: 30 and 36 → 66\n\nThird: 4 and 43 → 47\n\nFourth: 6 and 70 →76\n\nFifth:50 and70→120\n\nLet me try different operations:\n\nFirst idea: Maybe a + b? Let's check:\n\n69 +95 = 164. Hey, that's the first output! 69 +95 is indeed 164. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 30 +36 =66. Output is 66. So 30+36=66. That works too.\n\nThird input: 4 +43=47. Output is 47. So 4+43=47. That works.\n\nFourth input:6 +70=76. 6+70=76. Yes, output is 76. So far, so good.\n\nFifth input:50 +70=120. 50+70=120. Output is 120. Perfect.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all outputs match the sum of the two inputs.\n\nLet me list all:\n\n1. 69 +95 = 164 → Output is 164. Correct.\n2. 30 +36 =66 → Output is66. Correct.\n3. 4 +43=47 → Output is47. Correct.\n4. 6 +70=76 → Output is76. Correct.\n5. 50 +70=120 → Output is120. Correct.\n\nSo it seems the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else. Maybe multiplication? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 69*95=6555, which is not 164. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 95-69=26≠164. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 69* something? 69*2.36≈164? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a linear combination: a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me denote output = k*a + m*b.\n\nLet me set up equations for the first case:\n\nFor input a=69, b=95, output=164:\n\n69k +95m =164\n\nSecond input: a=30, b=36, output=66:\n\n30k +36m=66\n\nThird input: a=4, b=43, output=47:\n\n4k +43m=47\n\nFourth input: a=6, b=70, output=76:\n\n6k +70m=76\n\nFifth input: a=50, b=70, output=120:\n\n50k +70m=120\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 69k +95m =164\n\n2. 30k +36m =66\n\n3. 4k +43m =47\n\n4. 6k +70m =76\n\n5. 50k +70m =120\n\nLet me try solving the first two equations to find k and m.\n\nEquation 2: 30k +36m =66\n\nWe can simplify it by dividing both sides by 6:\n\n5k +6m =11. Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nEquation 1: 69k +95m =164\n\nLet me solve equation 2a for k:\n\n5k = 11 -6m\n\nk = (11 -6m)/5\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n69*( (11 -6m)/5 ) +95m =164\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n69*(11 -6m) + 475m = 820\n\nCompute 69*11 = 759, 69*(-6m)= -414m\n\nSo 759 -414m +475m =820\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n759 + (475m -414m)=759 +61m=820\n\n61m=820 -759=61\n\nThus m=1\n\nThen from equation 2a: 5k +6*1=11 →5k=5→k=1\n\nSo k=1, m=1\n\nLet me check if this works for the third equation:\n\n4k +43m =4*1 +43*1=47. Yes, 4+43=47. Correct.\n\nFourth equation:6k +70m=6*1 +70*1=76. Correct, since 6+70=76.\n\nFifth equation:50k +70m=50*1 +70*1=120. Correct, 50+70=120.\n\nSo yes! The rule is simply a + b. So the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify all outputs:\n\nFirst input:69 +95=164. Correct.\n\nSecond:30+36=66. Correct.\n\nThird:4+43=47. Correct.\n\nFourth:6+70=76. Correct.\n\nFifth:50+70=120.

Let's check:\n\n1. 21 + 65 = 86. Hey, that's exactly the output! 21 + 65 = 86. So first pair gives 86, which matches.\n\n2. 55 + 60 = 115. Output is 115. That works too.\n\n3. 41 + 46 = 87.

Maybe multiplication or something else.\n\nCheck another possibility: Maybe a multiplied by something or b multiplied.\n\nBut let's test:\n\nFor first input: 21* something + something else? 21*4 + something? 21*4=84, 84 +2=86. Maybe 4*b - something? Wait, 21* something plus b?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, 21 and 65 adding gives 86. 21* something? 21*4=84, plus 2 is 86. Maybe 4*b - something? 4*65=260, which is not 86. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe c = a + b - something.\n\n21 +65 = 86, which is equal to b? 65? No, 86 is not 65.

Maybe 21* something else.\n\nWait, 21*4=84, plus 2 is 86. Maybe 4*21 + 2? But 2 is b? Wait, b is 65 here? No, b is 65.\n\nWait, maybe it's a function like c = 2a + b?
