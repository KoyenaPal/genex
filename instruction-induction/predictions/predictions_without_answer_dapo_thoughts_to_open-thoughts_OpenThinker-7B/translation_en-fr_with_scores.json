This is correct.  \n- \"promoter\" in English translates to \"promoteur\" in French. This is correct.  \n- \"trim\" in English translates to \"assiette.\" This seems incorrect. \"Trim\" should translate to something like \"émondage\" or \"couper\" depending on the context, but \"assiette\" means \"plate.\" It appears there might be a mistake here.  \n- \"kiss\" in English translates to \"baiser\" in French. This is correct.  \n- \"anatomy\" in English translates to \"anatomie\" in French. This is correct.\n\nIt seems there's an anomaly with the word \"trim.\" If we assume that the friend made a mistake with \"trim,\" the instruction likely involves translating English words to French.\n\nLet's try to find the correct translation for \"trim\" and then provide the instruction.\n\nNow, let's apply this instruction to the new input: \"system.\"<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Translate each English word into its French equivalent**.  \n\nFor the input \"system\", the French translation is **système**.  \n\n**",
