Let's see:\n\n1. Input: \"I am anxious for you to arrive on time.\" [t] Output: \"to time\" which is a phrase from the sentence: \"to arrive on time\" but output is \"to time\" missing \"arrive on\". So maybe they removed words that contain the letter t? Wait \"to time\" contains t. The words \"to\" and \"time\" both contain t. The phrase \"to arrive on time\" includes \"to\" and \"time\". They removed \"arrive on\". So maybe they keep words that start with t? \"to\" starts with t, \"time\" starts with t. That matches.\n\n2. Input: \"Confiscate any liquor.\" [c] Output: \"confiscate\". Words starting with c: \"Confiscate\" and \"any\" and \"liquor\" - only \"Confiscate\" starts with c. So output \"confiscate\". Good.\n\n3. Input: \"We peered around the room.\" [a] Output: \"around\". Words starting with a: \"around\". Good.\n\n4. Input: \"Why did you kill Pegasus?\" [k] Output: \"kill\". Words starting with k: \"kill\". Good.\n\n5. Input: \"Susan found every book she had been looking for at Borders.\" [l] Output: \"looking\". Words starting with l: \"looking\".
