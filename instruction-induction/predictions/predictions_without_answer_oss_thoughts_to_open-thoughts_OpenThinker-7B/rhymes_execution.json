Let's check: stand → demand. Not an anagram. stand + d? stand + d = dstand? No. stand → demand: add ‘d’ and change letters? Let’s see.\n\nstand to demand: add ‘d’, change s to m? Not sure.\n\npig → dig: change p to d. So maybe replace first letter with the next letter in the alphabet? p→q? No. p→d is not next. pig → dig: change p to d, keep i g. So maybe replace first letter with the letter 12 positions earlier? p(16)→d(4) is –12. stand to demand: s(19)→d(4) is –15. Not consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: replace first letter with ‘d’ and keep the rest? stand→dand? No.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Replace the first letter with the letter that comes after it in the alphabet, and remove the last letter”? Let’s test: stand: s→t, remove last letter: tand? Not demand.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Take the input word, add a letter to the beginning, then rearrange to form a new word that is a synonym of the input”? stand → demand: demand is a synonym of stand? No.\n\nMaybe the new prefix is the first letter of the suffix? For stand: suffix 'and', first letter a. But new prefix is dem? Not.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Take the input word, replace the first letter with the first letter of the word ‘demand’ if the input starts with a consonant, else with m.”<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **\"Replace the first letter with 'd' if the input starts with a vowel, otherwise replace it with the next letter in the alphabet.\"**\n\n"

Actually invitation vs station: both end with 'tion'. invitation → station: remove 'invi' and add 's'?  \nmusician->composition: both end 'tion', musician vs composition: musician → composition: replace 'mu' with 'composi'?  \nname->game: replace 'n' with 'g'?  \ncake->shake: add 'sh' before 'ake'.  \nMaybe instruction: \"Replace the first letter with the next letter in alphabet\"? collect: c->d? no.  \nMaybe \"Add a letter to the beginning to form a new word ending with same suffix\"? collect->connect: connect starts with con, collect starts with col.

For “cave” → “behave” replace “c” with “b”, but also add “h” after? Actually “behave” is “be” + “have”. “cave” is “c” + “ave”.
