That is original string reversed? \"computer\" reversed is \"retupmoc\". Output is \"pmocretu\" which is not full reverse.  \nLet's analyze: \"computer\" letters: c o m p u t e r. Output:0 p (index3),1 m (2),2 o (1),3 c (0),4 r (7),5 e (6),6 t (5),7 u (4). So output is first half reversed then second half reversed? Actually split into two halves: first half \"comp\" reversed \"pmoc\". second half \"uter\" reversed \"retu\". Then concatenate: \"pmoc\" + \"retu\" = \"pmocretu\". Yes.  \nCheck \"data\": input \"data\" length4. First half \"da\" reversed \"ad\". Second half \"ta\" reversed \"at\". Concatenate \"ad\"+\"at\"=\"adat\". matches.  \n\"world\": length5. First half? For odd length, maybe first half floor(n/2)=2? \"wo\" reversed \"ow\". Second half \"rld\" reversed \"dlr\". Concatenate \"ow\"+\"dlr\"=\"owdlr\" but output is \"rowdl\". Let's try splitting differently: maybe first half ceil(n/2)=3? \"wor\" reversed \"row\". second half \"ld\" reversed \"dl\". Concatenate \"row\"+\"dl\"=\"rowdl\" matches.  \nSo rule: split string into two halves (first half is ceil(n/2) characters, second half is remaining floor(n/2)), reverse each half individually, then concatenate.  \nCheck \"algorithm\": length9. Ceil(9/2)=5 first half \"algor\" reversed \"rogla\". second half \"ithm\" reversed \"mhti\". Concatenate \"rogla\"+\"mhti\"=\"rogla mhti\" but output is \"oglarimht\". Wait output \"oglarimht\". Let's compute: first half \"algor\" reversed \"rogla\". second half \"ithm\" reversed \"mhti\". Combined \"rogla\"+\"mhti\"=\"rogla mhti\". Not match. So maybe they split differently: first half floor(n/2)=4? For length9, floor=4 first half \"algo\" reversed \"ogla\". second half \"rithm\" reversed \"mhtir\". Concatenate \"ogla\"+\"mhtir\"=\"oglamhtir\". Output \"oglarimht\". Not match.  \nMaybe they split into two halves of equal length except one char moved? Let's analyze mapping again: output letters correspond to input indices: 3,2,1,0,4,5,8,7,6. So pattern: first 4 indices reversed 0-3, then 4,5, then 8,7,6. So they reversed first half of length floor(n/2)=4, kept 4,5 unchanged, reversed last half floor(n/2)=3. That seems like they reversed first floor(n/2) letters, reversed last floor(n/2) letters. For odd length, middle two? But there are 9 letters, middle index 4. They kept indices 4 and 5 unchanged? Actually index5 is 'i', index4 is 'r'. They kept 'r','i' as is. So rule: For odd length, keep middle two letters unchanged, reverse first floor(n/2) letters, reverse last floor(n/2) letters. For even length, reverse both halves.  \nCheck \"world\" length5: floor(5/2)=2. First 2 letters reversed: \"wo\"->\"ow\". Middle two letters? indices 2 and 3: 'r','l' kept? They are 'r','l' in output? Output \"rowdl\": letters: r o w d l. That is not \"ow\"+\"rl\"+\"dl\"? Let's compute: first 2 reversed \"ow\". middle two indices 2,3: 'r','l' kept as 'r','l'. last 2 reversed: 'ld' reversed 'dl'. Concatenate: \"ow\"+\"rl\"+\"dl\"=\"owrldl\". Not match. So rule fails.  \nLet's analyze \"world\" mapping: output indices: 2,0,1,4,3. So pattern: first 3 letters reversed? indices 0-2 reversed: w o r -> r o w. Then last 2 reversed: l d -> d l. So they reversed first ceil(n/2)=3, then reversed last floor(n/2)=2. That matches earlier rule for even length. So for odd length, they reversed first ceil(n/2) and last floor(n/2). For \"algorithm\" length9: ceil(9/2)=5 first half reversed: a l g o r -> r o g l a. Output first 5 letters: o g l a r. That's not same. So maybe they reversed first ceil(n/2)-1? Let's compute: first 4 reversed: a l g o -> o g l a. That matches first 4 letters of output. Then middle letter index4 'r' moved to end of first part? Output first 5 letters: o g l a r. So they appended 'r' at end. Then last 4 reversed: i t h m -> m h t i. Output last 4 letters: i m h t. That's 'i' from middle? Wait 'i' is index5. They moved 'i' to start of last part. So pattern: For odd length, reverse first ceil(n/2)-1 letters, then middle letter, then reverse last ceil(n/2)-1 letters? Let's test: For length9, ceil-1=4. Reverse first 4: a l g o -> o g l a. Then middle letter index4 'r' appended: gives o g l a r. Then reverse last 4: i t h m -> m h t i. Append: gives o g l a r m h t i. But output is o g l a r i m h t. So they placed<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Reverse the first half of the string (rounded up) and the second half (rounded down), while keeping the middle character(s) in place if"
