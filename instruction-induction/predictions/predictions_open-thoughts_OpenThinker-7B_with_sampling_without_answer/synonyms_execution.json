    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: excessively\nOutput: too\n\nInput: leadership\nOutput: leading\n\nInput: art\nOutput: prowess\n\nInput: commend\nOutput: remember\n\nInput: accomplished\nOutput: complete\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the instruction could be that led to these input-output pairs. The user provided five examples where each input word is transformed into another output word. Let me start by analyzing each pair to see if there's a common pattern or rule.\n\nFirst pair: Input \"excessively\" becomes \"too\". Hmm. Let's break down both words. Excessively has 'excessive' as its base, but the output is just 'too'. Wait, maybe it's about removing certain letters or parts? Excessively has 10 letters. Too is 3. Not sure. Maybe looking at the meaning? Excessively means in excess, so perhaps the instruction is related to antonyms or synonyms? But \"too\" isn't a direct antonym. Alternatively, maybe it's about syllables or prefixes/suffixes.\n\nSecond pair: Leadership to leading. Leadership ends with \"-ship\", which usually forms nouns like leader + ship. The output is leading, which might be part of a verb. Maybe stripping off the suffix? Leadership becomes leading by removing '-ship'? That makes sense. So maybe the rule is to remove the suffix \"-ship\" from nouns? But wait, \"art\" becomes \"prowess\". Art doesn't have \"-ship\", so that contradicts. So that idea might not hold.\n\nThird pair: Art to prowess. Art is a noun. Prowess is also a noun. How are they connected? Prowess comes from \"prosperity\" or \"skill\". Maybe it's a synonym? But the first example isn't a synonym. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to take the root word and add a prefix or something. Not sure.\n\nFourth pair: Commend to remember. Commend means to praise or recommend. Remember is about recalling. Not obvious connection here. Maybe the instruction is to reverse the letters? Excessively reversed is 'cssixxte' which isn't too. Leadership reversed is 'desipilade' which isn't leading. So probably not reversal.\n\nFifth pair: Accomplished to complete. Accomplished is a past participle of accomplish, and complete is similar but not exactly the same. Maybe removing the suffix \"-ed\"? But accomplished becomes complete by dropping \"-ed\"? That would mean the rule is removing the past tense suffix. But then \"commend\" becomes \"remember\"—no, commend is present tense. Wait, commend (to praise) vs remember (to recall). Doesn't fit. Also, art becomes prowess, which isn't dropping a suffix.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be working. Let's look for other patterns. Let's check the outputs again:\n\nexcessively → too: Maybe the first three letters? Excessively starts with 'ex', but too is shorter. No. Or maybe the last three letters? Excessively ends with 'sely', but too is too short. Not matching.\n\nLeadership → leading: Maybe about the root before the suffix. So perhaps taking the root before the suffix. But art doesn't have a suffix. Hmm.\n\nCommend → remember: Let's think about possible transformations. Maybe changing the verb to a noun? Commend is a verb, remember is a verb. Not helpful. Art → prowess: Art is a noun, prowess is a noun. Maybe the instruction is to replace the noun with a related noun. But how does leadership become leading?\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to take the word and remove the last syllable. Excessively has syllables ex-ces-si-ly. Removing the last syllable (ly) gives exces, but output is too. Not helpful.\n\nLeadership: Li-der-ship. Removing \"ship\" gives leader, but output is leading. Not matching.\n\nCommend: Com-mend. Output is remember. No connection.\n\nArt: Ar-t. Output is prowess. No.\n\nAccomplished: A-com-ple-ished. Removing \"-ed\" gives accomplished, but output is complete. So maybe removing the past tense suffix \"-ed\"? But how does that apply to \"commend\" which ends with \"-ed\"? It would become \"com\", which isn't \"remember\". Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to take the word and add a suffix or prefix. For example, \"excessively\" → \"too\": If you drop \"ex-\" from \"excessive\", you get \"cessive\", but \"too\" is different.\n\nLeadership → remove \"-ship\" → \"leader\", but output is \"leading\". Not helpful.\n\nArt → no obvious suffix. Maybe remove the vowel? Art becomes prwss (prowess). No.\n\nCommend → remove \"-d\" → \"commen\",<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Remove the suffix \"-ed\"** from the input word and append the remaining stem with \"remember\". \n\nLet's verify each input-output pair:\n\n"

    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: opportunity\nOutput: chance\n\nInput: submit\nOutput: state\n\nInput: boring\nOutput: slow\n\nInput: summation\nOutput: addition\n\nInput: confluence\nOutput: meeting\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction could be based on the given input-output pairs. So, the friend was given an instruction and five inputs, each resulting in a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer that instruction.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a pattern or relationship between the input word and its output. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: opportunity → Output: chance  \n2. Submit → State  \n3. Boring → Slow  \n4. Summation → Addition  \n5. Confluence → Meeting  \n\nHmm. Let's start with the first pair. \"Opportunity\" becoming \"chance.\" Opportunity is a noun meaning a favorable circumstance, while chance is also a noun meaning an opportunity. Wait, but \"chance\" can also mean probability. Maybe the instruction is to find synonyms? But then, let's check other pairs.\n\nSecond input: Submit becomes State. Submitting something like a form would result in a state (like submitted). Or maybe \"submit\" as a verb means to present for consideration, and the output is \"state\" as in the condition? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"submit\" is being transformed into a synonym of \"submit\"? But \"state\" isn't a synonym of \"submit.\"\n\nThird pair: Boring → Slow. Boring is an adjective describing something monotonous; slow is an adjective meaning not fast. Maybe the instruction is to replace adjectives with their antonyms? But \"boring\" vs. \"slow\" aren't direct antonyms. Boring could imply lack of interest, while slow is about pace. Not exactly opposites.\n\nFourth: Summation → Addition. Summation is the act of adding numbers, so addition is the process. So here, the output is a synonym of the input. So perhaps the instruction is to replace the input word with its synonym?\n\nFifth: Confluence → Meeting. Confluence is a coming together of streams, but a meeting is a gathering. Hmm. Not sure. Unless it's a different kind of synonym or a different type of word association.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the fourth pair. Summation is a noun, addition is a noun. So they're synonyms. Similarly, \"confluence\" and \"meeting\" – but confluence is more about joining, while meeting is a gathering. Maybe the friend is replacing nouns with words related to them but not exact synonyms. Or perhaps the instruction is to find the part of speech of the input and map it to another part of speech?\n\nLooking back at the first pair: opportunity (noun) → chance (noun). Same part of speech. Second: submit (verb) → state (noun). Third: boring (adj) → slow (adj). Fourth: summation (noun) → addition (noun). Fifth: confluence (noun) → meeting (noun). So in four out of five cases, the part of speech is preserved. Only the second pair changes from verb to noun. Hmm. So maybe the instruction is to convert the input word into its synonym, preserving part of speech where possible, but sometimes changing parts of speech?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to take the input word and replace it with a word that has a similar meaning but belongs to a different category. For example, opportunity is replaced with chance (same category), submit might be replaced with state (different category?), but wait, submit is a verb, state is a noun. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, summa- is the root of both summation and addition. So maybe the friend was instructed to take the root of the word. Let's check:\n\nSummation: summa + tion → summa is Latin for total, so summation is about totaling. Addition: add + ition. So if the instruction was to drop the suffix and take the root, but that doesn't directly give the outputs. Because \"summa\" vs \"add\" doesn't match the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend was instructed to find the antonym. But \"opportunity\" antonym is maybe \"obstacle,\" not \"chance.\" \"Boring\" antonym is \"interesting,\" not \"slow.\" So that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at the fifth pair: confluence → meeting. Confluence is a coming together of streams, but a meeting is a gathering. Maybe the instruction is to replace technical terms with everyday words. Confluence is a technical term, meeting is more common.\n\nBut the third pair: boring (adjective) → slow (adjective). Maybe the instruction is to describe the input using a different adjective. For example, \"boring\" implies monotony, which could relate to \"slow.\" But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, let's think about the second pair again: submit → state. Submit is a verb meaning to present for consideration. State can be a noun meaning a condition or a political entity. If you submit something, you put it into a state. So maybe the instruction is to replace the verb with the resulting state. Like, submitting leads to a state (as in the condition after submission). That could be the case.\n\nSimilarly, for \"confluence,\" which is a noun (a coming together of streams), the output is \"meeting\" (noun). Confluence refers to a confluence of ideas or events, maybe leading to a meeting. Or perhaps \"confluence\" is a place where streams meet, so the output is \"meeting\" as in gathering. Not sure.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n1. Opportunity → chance: same part of speech, synonyms. So maybe synonym replacement.  \n2. Submit → state: submit leads to a state (submitted state).  \n3. Boring → slow: maybe adjectives describing a similar aspect, but not exact synonyms. Perhaps \"boring\" implies \"slow\" in some contexts.  \n4. Summation → addition: Summation is the process of adding, so the output is \"addition.\"  \n5. Confluence → meeting: confluence refers to the coming together, so meeting is the result.\n\nBut how do these fit under a single instruction? Let's consider possible instructions.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- Synonym replacement: But then why does \"submit\" become \"state\" instead of \"present\"? Because \"submit\" and \"state\" aren't synonyms. So that might not fit all cases.\n\n- Antonym: Doesn't fit well except maybe \"opportunity\" and \"chance\" if \"chance\" is considered the opposite in some contexts. But that's not a standard antonym.\n\n- Replacing with the part of speech root: Like taking the root and adding a suffix. For example, \"opportunity\" → \"oppor-\" + \"tunity\" → maybe not helpful.\n\n- Converting to a related term: Submitting leads to a state. Boring leading to slow. Confluence leading to meeting. Summation to addition. So maybe the instruction is to replace the input word with a word that is related through a cause-effect relationship.\n\nLet me analyze each input-output:\n\n1. Opportunity → chance: Both are nouns, synonyms. So maybe synonym replacement. But \"chance\" can mean opportunity, but also luck. So maybe the friend was told to replace the word with its synonym, which could vary based on context. But \"opportunity\" and \"chance\" are synonyms. So maybe that's the case.\n\n2. Submit → state: Submitting causes something to enter a state. So the output is the resulting state.\n\n3. Boring → slow: Boring describes something tedious, which can feel slow. So perhaps the output is a synonym related to the feeling of boredom.\n\n4. Summation → addition: Summation is the process of adding, so addition is the result.\n\n5. Confluence → meeting: Confluence is the coming together, so meeting is the outcome.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take the input word and replace it with a homophone or a word with a similar pronunciation. But \"opportunity\" and \"chance\" don't sound alike. \"Submit\" and \"state\" don't either. \"Boring\" and \"slow\" have some phonetic similarity but not enough.\n\nAnother angle: Could it be replacing with a homonym? For example, \"opportunity\" sounds like \"open for profit\" (but that's not helpful). \"Submit\" sounds like \"stutter\"? No. \"Boring\" sounds like \"bo-ring\", but not sure. \"Summation\" sounds like \"sum-ma-tion\". Not helpful. \"Confluence\" sounds like \"con-fluence\". Maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: Think about the roots of the words. \"Opportunity\" comes from \"opportunity,\" \"submit\" comes from Latin \"sub\" + \"mittere\" (to send), \"boring\" from \"borne\" + \"-ing\" (past participle of bear), \"summation\" from \"sum\" + \"mation\", \"confluence\" from \"con\" + \"fluere\" (to flow).\n\nNot sure if that helps. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the outputs:\n\n1. chance (synonym)  \n2. state (resulting condition)  \n3. slow (related to experience)  \n4. addition (synonym)  \n5. meeting (place of confluence)\n\nWait, but how does this tie into a single instruction? Let's think about the verbs and their outputs:\n\n- Submit (verb) → state (noun)  \n- Boring (adj) → slow (adj)  \n- Summation (noun) → addition (noun)  \n- Confluence (noun) → meeting (noun)\n<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Replace each input word with a synonym or a concept closely associated through a cause-effect relationship**. \n\n### Analysis:\n- **opportunity → chance"
