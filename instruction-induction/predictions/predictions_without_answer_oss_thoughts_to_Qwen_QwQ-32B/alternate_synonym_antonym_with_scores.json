Actually child vs kid synonyms but maybe opposite? But kid is same. But maybe “child” replaced with “kid” but not opposite. But “outside” → “indoors.” “correct” → “right” (synonym). “answer” → “solution” (synonym). “found” → “lost.” So pattern: replace some words with antonyms or synonyms? Let’s analyze each pair:\n\n1. Input: The happy child played outside.  \n   Output: The sad kid played indoors.  \n   Mapping: happy→sad (antonym). child→kid (synonym). played→played (same). outside→indoors (antonym). So some words replaced with antonyms, some synonyms.\n\n2. He found the correct answer.  \n   Output: He lost the right solution.  \n   Mapping: He→He (same). found→lost (antonym). the→the (same). correct→right (synonym). answer→solution (synonym). So pattern: replace some words with antonyms, some with synonyms.\n\n3. The expensive car runs smoothly.  \n   Output: The cheap vehicle runs roughly.  \n   Mapping: The→The. expensive→cheap (antonym). car→vehicle (synonym). runs→runs. smoothly→roughly (antonym). So again.\n\n4. She turned left at the corner.  \n   Output: She turned right at the intersection.  \n   Mapping: She→She. turned→turned. left→right (antonym). at→at. the→the. corner→intersection (synonym). So pattern: replace some words with antonyms, some with synonyms.\n\n5. The full moon was bright.  \n   Output: The empty satellite was dim.  \n   Mapping: The→The. full→empty (antonym). moon→satellite (synonym). was→was. bright→dim (antonym).\n\nThe examples show that some words are replaced with synonyms (child→kid, answer→solution, car→vehicle, corner→intersection, moon→satellite). Others replaced with antonyms (happy→sad, outside→indoors, found→lost, smoothly→roughly, full→empty, bright→dim).</think> The instruction is: For each sentence, replace certain words with their antonyms or synonyms to create a contrasting meaning.
