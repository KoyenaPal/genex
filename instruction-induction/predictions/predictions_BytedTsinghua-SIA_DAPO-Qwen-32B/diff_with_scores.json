It seems like we need to find a pattern or rule that transforms the given pairs of numbers into the output.\n\nLet's analyze the given input-output pairs:\n\n1. Input: 58, 29\n   Output: 29\n\n2. Input: 88, 20\n   Output: 68\n\n3. Input: 94, 43\n   Output: 51\n\n4. Input: 86, 37\n   Output: 49\n\n5.

We have the following input-output pairs:\n\n1. Input: $(120, 52)$, Output: $68$\n2. Input: $(157, 61)$, Output: $96$\n3. Input: $(109, 14)$, Output: $95$\n4. Input: $(108, 12)$, Output: $96$\n5. Input: $(84, 26)$, Output: $58$\n\nLet's try to derive a formula for the output $z$ based on the inputs $x$ and $y$. We'll test a few possible formulas.\n\nOne common approach is to check if the output can be expressed as a simple arithmetic operation involving $x$ and $y$. Let's test the formula $z = x - y$.\n\nFor the first input-output pair $(120, 52)$ and output $68$:\n\\[ z = 120 - 52 = 68. \\]\nThis matches the output.\n\nFor the second input-output pair $(157, 61)$ and output $96$:\n\\[ z = 157 - 61 = 96. \\]\nThis matches the output.\n\nFor the third input-output pair $(109, 14)$ and output $95$:\n\\[ z = 109 - 14 = 95. \\]\nThis matches the output.\n\nFor the fourth input-output pair $(108, 12)$ and output $96$:\n\\[ z = 108 - 12 = 96. \\]\nThis matches the output.\n\nFor the fifth input-output pair $(84, 26)$ and output $58$:\n\\[ z = 84 - 26 = 58. \\]\nThis matches the output.\n\nSince the formula $z = x - y$ works for all the given input-output pairs, the instruction appears to be to subtract the second number from the first number.\n\nThus, the instruction is: \"Subtract the second number from the first number.\"\n\nSo the formula is $z = x - y$.\n\nTo confirm:\n\n- For $(120, 52)$: $120 - 52 = 68$. Correct.\n- For $(157, 61)$: $157 - 61 = 96$. Correct.\n- For $(109, 14)$: $109 - 14 = 95$. Correct.\n- For $(108, 12)$: $108 - 12 = 96$. Correct.\n- For $(84, 26)$: $84 - 26 = 58$.
