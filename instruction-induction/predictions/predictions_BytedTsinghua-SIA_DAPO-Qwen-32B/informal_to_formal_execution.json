Input: \"See you tonight.\"\n   Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n   - Transformation: Changed the casual expression to a more formal and anticipatory statement.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\"\n   Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   - Transformation: Changed the expression of thanks into a more formal and polite statement.\n\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\"\n   Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - Transformation: Replaced the colloquial phrase \"made up\" with the more formal word \"fabricated.\"\n\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\n   Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - Transformation: Changed the casual expression \"can't tell the difference\" to the more formal \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\"\n   Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - Transformation: Changed the sentence structure from active voice to passive voice and used a synonym (\"various\" for \"many\").\n\nFrom these transformations, it seems that the instruction involves rephrasing the sentences in a more formal or sophisticated manner, often changing the structure or using more formal vocabulary.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely is: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone.<|endoftext|></think> \nRewrite the sentence in a more formal tone.<|endoftext|>"

Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\n   Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\"\n   Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - This is a passive voice transformation and rephrasing: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\n3. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\n   Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - This involves a significant rephrasing: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now\" is transformed into a suggestion form, \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\n4. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the change is from \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" making a slight adjustment to the grammatical structure.\n\n5. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\"\n   Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - This involves both a synonym change (\"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated\") and a slight rephrasing.\n\nBased on these examples, the instruction likely involves paraphrasing sentences to either make them more formal, change their structure (e.g., from active to passive voice), or use synonyms.\n\nThe instruction could be something like: \"Rewrite the sentence in a different but equivalent form, possibly making it more formal or changing its structure.\"\n\nNow, let's come up with a new input and apply this instruction.\n\nNew Input: \"She quickly finished her homework.\"\n\nTo rewrite this sentence following the pattern from the examples:\n\n1. We could change the structure.\n2. We could use synonyms.\n3. We could make it more formal.\n\nLet's try a few options:\n\nOption 1: \"Her homework was quickly finished by her.\"\n- This changes the sentence to passive voice.\n\nOption 2: \"She completed her homework rapidly.\"\n- This uses a synonym for \"quickly\" (i.e., \"rapidly\").\n\nOption 3: \"She finished her homework in a swift manner.\"\n- This uses a different way to express \"quickly.\"\n\nAmong these options, let's choose the one that best fits the style of the given examples.\n\nOutput: \"Her homework was quickly finished by her.\"\n\nSo the output for the new input \"She quickly finished her homework\" would be:\n\nOutput: \"Her homework was quickly finished by her.\"<|endoftext|></think> \nThe output for the new input \"She quickly finished her homework\" is: \"Her homework was quickly finished by her.\"<|endoftext|>"
