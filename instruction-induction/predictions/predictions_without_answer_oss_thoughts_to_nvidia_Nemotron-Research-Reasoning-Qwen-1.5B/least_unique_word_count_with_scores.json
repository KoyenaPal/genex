Not.  \n\nMaybe output is number of items that share a property?  \nFor first list, maybe number of animals that are mammals? cat, dog, elephant are mammals (3). That matches output 3.  \nSecond list: tree, flower, grass, plant, garden. Which are plants? All are plants? But output 4. Maybe number of items that are plants but not trees? tree is tree, flower, grass, plant are plants, garden is not a plant. So 4.  \nThird list: computer, phone, tablet, keyboard, mouse. Which are electronic devices? All 5. Output 5.  \nFourth: mountain, river, ocean, desert, forest. Which are natural features? All 5. Output 5.  \nFifth: happy, sad, angry, excited, calm. Which are emotions? All 5. Output 3? But all 5 are emotions.  \n\nSo maybe output is number of emotions that are negative? sad, angry = 2. Not 3.  \nMaybe number of emotions that are positive? happy, excited, calm = 3. That matches output 3.  \nSo rule: count positive emotions.
