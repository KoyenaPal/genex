Actually apple reversed is \"elppa\". Yes.  \nFor second, output \"elcitrA\" which is \"A\" + \"tricle\"? Wait \"article\" reversed is \"elcitra\". But output is \"elcitrA\" with capital A at end. So maybe they reversed the word and capitalized first letter?  \nFor \"article\" reversed is \"elcitra\". They output \"elcitrA\" capital A at end.  \nFor \"train\" reversed is \"niart\". Output \"elcycib\" not match. Wait \"bicycle\" reversed is \"elcycib\". Yes output matches reversed \"bicycle\".  \nSo they pick one word from list? Which one?  \nFor first list, apple reversed.  \nFor second list, article reversed but capitalized last letter?  \nFor third list, bicycle reversed.  \nFor fourth list, blue reversed.  \nFor fifth list, Monday reversed.  \nSo rule: pick the word that is alphabetically first? Let's check: list1: grape, cherry, strawberry, banana, apple. Alphabetical order: apple, banana, cherry, grape, strawberry. They output apple reversed.  \nList2: magazine, article, newspaper, journal, book. Alphabetical: article, book, journal, magazine, newspaper. They output article reversed.  \nList3: train, bicycle, motorcycle, truck, car. Alphabetical: bicycle, car, motorcycle, train, truck. They output bicycle reversed.  \nList4: yellow, purple, red, green, blue. Alphabetical: blue, green, purple, red, yellow. They output blue reversed.  \nList5: Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Thursday, Tuesday. Alphabetical: Friday, Monday, Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday. They output Monday reversed.  \nBut why capital A? In article reversed, last letter A capitalized. Maybe they preserve original capitalization? Original article is lowercase. But output has capital A. So maybe they capitalize the first letter of the reversed word? For apple reversed \"elppa\" all lowercase. For article reversed \"elcitra\" but they capitalized last letter? Wait maybe they capitalize the first letter of the original word? For article, first letter 'a' becomes 'A' at end after reversal. For apple, original 'a' lowercase, so remains lowercase. So inconsistent. Maybe they capitalize the first letter of the original word if it is a proper noun? Monday is capitalized, reversed \"yadnoM\" capital M at end. So they preserve capitalization of first letter of original word, moving it to end. For apple, original 'a' lowercase, so remains lowercase. For article, original 'a' lowercase, remains lowercase. So why output \"elcitrA\"? Wait maybe a mistake?</think> The instruction is: Reverse the order of the words and capitalize the first letter of the last word. Let me verify:\n\n1.

Output: tekca j. That seems like maybe take last letters? Let's check: shoes -> e, socks -> s, shirt -> t, pants -> s, jacket -> t. That would be e s t s t. Not match. Maybe reverse each word? shoes->sehos, socks->skcso, etc. Not.  \n\nMaybe take first letters reversed? shoes s, socks s, shirt s, pants p, jacket j => s s s p j. Not.  \n\nOutput tekca j: maybe \"jacket\" reversed is \"tekca\".  \nYes jacket reversed is tekca.  \nThen space then j? Wait output \"tekca j\" with extra j. That could be \"tekca\" then space then \"j\".  \nCould be \"jacket\" reversed then space then first letter of first word? First word shoes first letter s? No j.  \nMaybe first letter of last word? jacket j.  \nSo output is last word reversed plus space then first letter of last word. For second: drums reversed smurd, first letter of drums d.
