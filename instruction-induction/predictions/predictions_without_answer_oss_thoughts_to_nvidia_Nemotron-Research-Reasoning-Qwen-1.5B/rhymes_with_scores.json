Let's check: stand → demand. Not an anagram. stand + d? stand + d = dstand? No. stand → demand: add ‘d’ and change letters? Let’s see.\n\nstand to demand: add ‘d’, change s to m? Not sure.\n\npig → dig: change p to d. So maybe replace first letter with the next letter in the alphabet? p→q? No. p→d is not next. pig → dig: change p to d, keep i g. So maybe replace first letter with the letter 12 positions earlier? p(16)→d(4) is –12. stand to demand: s(19)→d(4) is –15. Not consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: replace first letter with ‘d’ and keep the rest? stand→dand? No.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Replace the first letter with the letter that comes after it in the alphabet, and remove the last letter”? Let’s test: stand: s→t, remove last letter: tand? Not demand.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Take the input word, add a letter to the beginning, then rearrange to form a new word that is a synonym of the input”? stand → demand: demand is a synonym of stand? No.\n\nMaybe the new prefix is the first letter of the suffix? For stand: suffix 'and', first letter a. But new prefix is dem? Not.\n\nMaybe the instruction: “Take the input word, replace the first letter with the first letter of the word ‘demand’ if the input starts with a consonant, else with m.”</think> The instruction is: \"Take the input word and replace its first letter with 'd' if it's a consonant, else replace with 'm'.\" Let's",

Actually invitation vs station: both end with 'tion'. invitation → station: remove 'invi' and add 's'?  \nmusician->composition: both end 'tion', musician vs composition: musician → composition: replace 'mu' with 'composi'?  \nname->game: replace 'n' with 'g'?  \ncake->shake: add 'sh' before 'ake'.  \nMaybe instruction: \"Replace the first letter with the next letter in alphabet\"? collect: c->d? no.  \nMaybe \"Add a letter to the beginning to form a new word ending with same suffix\"? collect->connect: connect starts with con, collect starts with col.

Actually “cave” → “behave” is “c” replaced by “b”, “a” same, “v” replaced by “h”, “e” same. Not simple.  \n\nMaybe instruction: “Add a letter to the beginning to make a word that rhymes with the input”? Not.  \n\nCheck: “snow” → “so” remove “n” and “w”. “relation” → “station” remove “rel” and add “st”? “mess” → “less” replace “m” with “l”. “sick” → “quick” replace “s” with “qu”.  \n\nSeems pattern: replace first letter with another letter to form new word. For “cave” → “behave” replace “c” with “b”, but also add “h” after? Actually “behave” is “be” + “have”. “cave” is “c” + “ave”. So replace “c” with “b” and add “h” after “b”? “snow” → “so” remove “n” and “w”. “relation” → “station” remove “rel” with “st”. “mess” → “less” replace “m” with “l”. “sick” → “quick” replace “s” with “qu”.  \n\nSo instruction maybe: “Replace the first letter(s) of the input with the first letter of the word ‘be,’ then insert an ‘h’ immediately after that new first letter, and keep the rest of the original word unchanged.” Not.</think> The instruction is: \"Replace the first letter of the input word with the first letter of the word 'be' and append 'h'.\" \n\nWait, let's",
