Let's try to find the pattern here.\n\nFor each set of input words, let’s analyze them:\n\n1. `rat, computer, keyboard, mouse, monitor`\n\n2. `ox, tractor, farm, field, barn`\n\n3. `tiger, jungle, tree, vine, canopy`\n\n4. `rabbit, carrot, garden, lettuce, cabbage`\n\n5. `dragon, castle, knight, sword, shield`\n\nAnd their corresponding outputs are: 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 respectively.\n\nNotice that the outputs are perfect squares: \\(1 = 1^2\\), \\(4 = 2^2\\), \\(9 = 3^2\\), \\(16 = 4^2\\), and \\(25 = 5^2\\).\n\nTo find a pattern, let’s look at the words in the context of how they might be associated or related to each other and to some common theme or measure.\n\nOne possible approach is to count the number of vowels in all words of each input set and then perform some operation on the total number of vowels.\n\nLet's count the vowels in each set of words and see if we can detect a pattern.\n\n### Set 1: rat, computer, keyboard, mouse, monitor\n- rat: a (1 vowel)\n- computer: o, u, e (3 vowels)\n- keyboard: e, o (2 vowels)\n- mouse: o, u, e (3 vowels)\n- monitor: o, i, o (3 vowels)\n\nTotal number of vowels: \\(1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12\\).\n\nNow let's take the square root of the output for this set, which was 1 (which corresponds to \\(1^2\\)). Therefore, if there's a pattern where the output is a square, the base number for the square might relate to the vowels somehow.\n\n### Set 2: ox, tractor, farm, field, barn\n- ox: o (1 vowel)\n- tractor: a, o (2 vowels)\n- farm: a (1 vowel)\n- field: i, e (2 vowels)\n- barn: a (1 vowel)\n\nTotal number of vowels: \\(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7\\).\n\nThe output for this set is 4 (\\(2^2\\)).\n\n### Set 3: tiger, jungle, tree, vine, canopy\n- tiger: i, e (2 vowels)\n- jungle: u, e (2 vowels)\n- tree: e, e (2 vowels)\n- vine: i, e (2 vowels)\n- canopy: a, o (2 vowels)\n\nTotal number of vowels: \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10\\).\n\nThe output for this set is 9 (\\(3^2\\)).\n\n### Set 4: rabbit, carrot, garden, lettuce, cabbage\n- rabbit: a, i (2 vowels)\n- carrot: a, o (2 vowels)\n- garden: a, e (2 vowels)\n- lettuce: e, u, e (3 vowels)\n- cabbage: a, e (2 vowels)\n\nTotal number of vowels: \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11\\).\n\nThe output for this set is 16 (\\(4^2\\)).\n\n### Set 5: dragon, castle, knight, sword, shield\n- dragon: o, a (2 vowels)\n- castle: a, e (2 vowels)\n- knight: i, e (2 vowels)\n- sword: o (1 vowel)\n- shield: i, e (2 vowels)\n\nTotal number of vowels: \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9\\).\n\nThe output for this set is 25 (\\(5^2\\)).\n\nLet us now tabulate the total number of vowels for each set and compare with the given outputs:\n\n| Set                    | Vowel Count | Output (Square) | Root of Output |\n|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| rat, computer, ... | 12           | 1               | 1              |\n| ox, tractor, ...      | 7            | 4               | 2              |\n| tiger, jungle, ...    | 10           | 9               | 3              |\n| rabbit, carrot, ...   | 11           | 16              | 4              |\n| dragon, castle, ...   | 9            | 25              | 5              |\n\nLet's denote the total vowels as \\(V\\) for each set and the output square number as \\(S^2\\), where \\(S\\) is the root of the output.\n\nThe outputs given were 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25. So the roots are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. These correspond to the set numbers themselves since they appear in order.\n\nLet's see if we can find a pattern relating the total number of vowels (V) to the output.\n\nWe have the following data points for our analysis:\n\n1. Set 1: \\(V_1 = 12\\), \\(S_1 = 1\\)\n2. Set 2: \\(V_2 = 7\\), \\(S_2 = 2\\)\n3. Set 3: \\(V_3 = 10\\), \\(S_3 = 3\\)\n4. Set 4: \\(V_4 = 11\\), \\(S_4 = 4\\)\n5. Set 5: \\(V_5 = 9\\), \\(S_5 = 5\\)\n\nLet's try to create an equation relating \\(V\\) and \\(S\\). Let's look for a potential rule where\n\n\\[ S = f(V).\\]\n\nIf we list the relations between the vowel totals and the roots of the outputs, we have:\n\n- For the first set: \\(12\\) vowels gives \\(S = 1\\)\n- For the second set: \\(7\\) vowels gives \\(S = 2\\)\n- For the third set: \\(10\\) vowels gives \\(S = 3\\)\n- For the fourth set: \\(11\\) vowels gives \\(S = 4\\)\n- For the fifth set: \\(9\\) vowels gives \\(S = 5\\)\n\nSeeing that the outputs are squares of consecutive integers and ordered by the sets, let's check if there’s any offset relationship. We will try to find a function like \\(V = f(S) + c\\) or something that could link them.\n\nLet's take the formula\n\n\\[ S = a \\cdot V + b \\]\n\nand plug in some points to try and determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nFor the first set: \\(12a + b = 1\\).\n\nFor the second set: \\(7a + b = 2\\).\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first one:\n\n\\[ (12a + b) - (7a + b) = 1 - 2 \\]\n\\[ 5a = -1\\]\n\\[ a = -\\frac{1}{5}.\\]\n\nNow plug in \\(a = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) back into one of the equations, say \\(12a + b = 1\\):\n\n\\[12(-\\frac{1}{5}) + b = 1\\]\n\\[-\\frac{12}{5} + b = 1.\\]\n\\[b = 1 + \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{17}{5}. \\]\n\nSo the potential formula is \n\n\\[ S = - \\frac{1}{5} V + \\frac{17}{5}.\\]\n\nLet's test this formula with the other sets:\n\nFor the third set: \\( V_3 = 10.\\)\n\nUsing our formula: \n\n\\[ S_3 = -\\frac{1}{5}(10) + \\frac{17}{5} = -2 + \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{-10 + 17}{5} = \\frac{7}{5}.\\]\n\nThis gives us \\( S = \\frac{7}{5},\\) which is incorrect because \\(S_3 = 3.\\). Clearly this linear relationship isn't correct.\n\nLet's try another approach — maybe the answer has something to do with the rank or position.\n\nObserving the relationship between the outputs and the positions:\n\nThe first set gave an output 1.\nThe second set gave 4.\nThe third set gave 9.\nThe fourth set gave 16.\nThe fifth set gave 25.\n\nThis seems to correspond to the squares of consecutive integers. Let's denote the sets by their positions \\(i (1 to 5)\\), and see if the number of vowels has any relationship with the position and the square.\n\nLet's assume the output is $i^2,$ where i denotes the set number.\n\nNow we will find a potential function like the sum of the vowels minus something gives the square of the set number.\n\nLet's define the function in another way. Let's use the following trial approach:\n\n\\[S^2 = (some function of total vowels) \\]\n\nLet's consider the pattern based on position i and number of vowels.\n\nIf \\(V_i\\) denotes the number of vowels for the $i^{th}$ set, here</think> The instruction is: **Calculate the sum of the number of vowels in the given words for a set and then determine the corresponding output which follows a pattern of perfect squares."

The outputs appear to be perfect squares (36, 49, 64, 81, 100 which correspond to the squares of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 respectively).\n\nTo determine the pattern, we need to find a relationship between the input sets of words and the output numbers.\n\nLet's try using the number of letters in each word from the inputs:\n\nFor the first input - \"snake, grass, rock, desert, sand\":\n- \"snake\" has 5 letters.\n- \"grass\" has 5 letters.\n- \"rock\" has 4 letters.\n- \"desert\" has 6 letters.\n- \"sand\" has 4 letters.\n\nNow sum up the number of letters:\n\\[ 5 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24. \\]\nIt appears we might need to take the square root of the output and see if it matches something related to the sum or some other characteristic.\n\nSince the output is 36, which is \\(6^2\\), let’s check if this 6 has any relationship to the sum (24).\n\nNotice that:\n\\[ \\sqrt{36}=6. \\]\n\nIf we look for a possible connection between the sum (24) and 6, one possibility is dividing the sum by 4:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{4} = 6. \\]\n\nLet's test this pattern with the other inputs.\n\nFor the second input - \"horse, saddle, bridle, stable, hay\":\n- \"horse\" has 5 letters.\n- \"saddle\" has 6 letters.\n- \"bridle\" has 6 letters.\n- \"stable\" has 6 letters.\n- \"hay\" has 3 letters.\n\nThe sum of these letters is:\n\\[ 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 26. \\]\nThe output for this set is 49, which is \\(7^2\\).\n\nUsing our potential pattern, we divide 26 by 4:\n\\[ \\frac{26}{4} = 6.5. \\]\n\nIt seems we might need to round the number or use some other related approach. Let’s check if it makes sense to round \\(6.5\\) to the nearest integer:\n\\[ \\text{Rounded}(6.5) = 7. \\]\n\nIt matches since the output corresponds to $7^2 = 49$. So the pattern seems to hold.\n\nFor the third input - \"goat, mountain, cliff, grass, meadow\":\n- \"goat\" has 4 letters.\n- \"mountain\" has 7 letters.\n- \"cliff\" has 5 letters.\n- \"grass\" has 5 letters.\n- \"meadow\" has 6 letters.\n\nThe sum of the letters is:\n\\[ 4 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 27.\\]\n\nThe output for this set is 64, which is \\(8^2\\).\n\nUsing the pattern:\n\\[ \\frac{27}{4} = 6.75.\\]\nRound this to the nearest integer:\n\\[ \\text{Rounded}(6.75) = 7.\\]\n\nIt looks like we got to 7, but that would correspond to 49 (not 64). So it seems like the approach of dividing by 4 and checking the result is not quite right yet.\n\nLet's try another approach: calculating the average number of letters and then taking the closest perfect square output. \n\nLet's try the sum of letters divided by the number of words (which is always 5), so:\n\nFor the first input (\"snake, grass, rock, desert, sand\"):\nTotal letters = $24$, \nNumber of words = 5.\nThe average length of the words is:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8.\\]\nIf we round 4.8 to the nearest integer, we get 5, and $5^2 = 25$, which doesn't match 36.\n\nFor the second input (\"horse, saddle, bridle, stable, hay\"), the total sum of letters is 26, \nso the average is \n\\[ \\frac{26}{5} = 5.2. \\]\nIf we round 5.2 to the nearest integer, we get 5, and $5^2 = 25$, which again doesn’t match 49.\n\nIt seems this isn't the correct approach.\n\n**Next, we try a different method: adding up the sum of letters and finding some operation on that sum.**\n\nFor \"snake, grass, rock, desert, sand\", we found the sum of letters is $24$. The output is 36. Let's see what mathematical operation we can do to link $24$ to $36$. \n\\[ \\]\n\nOne hypothesis could be: $\\sqrt{\\text{Output}} = f(\\text{Sum of letters})$.\n\nLet's denote the sum of letters for the $n^\\text{th}$ input as $S_n$, and let's denote the given output as $O_n = k_n^2,$ where $k_n$ is some integer related to the sum.\n\nFor the first input:\n$S_1 = 24.$\nGiven output is $O_1 = 36$, and $\\sqrt{36} = 6.$\n\nLet’s assume a linear function connecting the sum of letters to the square root of the output, i.e.,\n$\\sqrt{O_n} = m \\cdot S_n + c$.\n\nBut since we have multiple data points, let’s try another simpler relationship, like dividing and rounding, but let's approach systematically.\n\nLet's look at each input's sum of letters and the output, and try some operations:\n\n- **First input:** $snake, grass, rock, desert, sand$\n  - Sum of letters: $5+5+4 +6 +4 = 24.$ \n  - Output: 36. \n  - $\\sqrt{36}=6.$\n\n- **Second input:** $horse, saddle, bridle, stable, hay$\n  - Sum of letters: $5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 26.$\n  - Output: 49. \n  - $\\sqrt{49} = 7.$\n\n- **Third input:** $goat, mountain, cliff, grass, meadow$\n  - Sum of letters: $4 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 6 =27.$\n  - Output: 64. \n  - $\\sqrt{64} = 8.$\n\n- **Fourth input:** $monkey, banana, tree, branch, swing$\n  - Sum of letters: $6 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 27.$\n  - Output: 81.\n  - $\\sqrt{81} = 9.$\n\n- **Fifth input:** $rooster, farm, egg, coop, feather$\n  - Sum of letters: $7 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 25.$\n  - Output: 100. \n  - $\\sqrt{100} =10.$\n\nWe have the following data points:\n\n| Input | Sum of Letters | Output | $\\sqrt{\\text{Output}}$ |\n|-------|----------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| 1st   | 24             | 36     | 6                     |\n| 2nd   | 26             | 49     | 7                     |\n| 3rd   | 27             | 64     | 8                     |\n| 4th   | 27             | 81     | 9                     |\n| 5th   | 25             | 100    | 10                    |\n\n\nLet's denote the sum of letters as $S$ and $\\sqrt{\\text{Output}}$ as $k$.\n\nFrom the table data points, we have:\n1. For the first input: $(S_1 = 24, k_1 = 6),$\n2. For the second input: $(S_2 = 26, k_2 = 7),$\n3. For the third input: $(S_3 = 27, k_3 = 8),$\n4. For the fourth input: $(S_4 = 27, k_4 = 9),$\n5. For the fifth input: $(S_5 = 25, k_5 = 10).$\n\nTo find a pattern between the sum of letters $S$ and $\\sqrt{\\text{Output}} (= k),$ let's calculate differences:\n\n- For the first pair (24, 6): If we assume a relationship $k = mS + n,$\nplug in the values for the first input:\n\\[ 6 = m(24)+ n.\\]\nThis gives us our first equation: \n(1) $24m + n = 6.$\n\nUsing the second pair (26, 7):\n\\[ 7 = m(26) + n.\\] \nThis gives us our second equation: \n(2) $26m +n =7.$\n\nLet's solve these simultaneous equations (1) and (2). \nSubtract equation (</think> The instruction is: to find a pattern that connects the sum of the letters in the five words in each dataset to a perfect square output.\n\nNow subtract equation (1)"

It doesn’t seem like it directly corresponds to 81 through any common operations.\n\nLet's try counting consonants:\n\nFor camera, lens, monkey, tripod, flash:\n\n- Camera: c, m, r (3 consonants)\n- Lens: l, n, s (3 consonants)\n- Monkey: m, n, k, y (4 consonants)\n- Tripod: t, r, p, d (4 consonants)\n- Flash: f, l, s, h (4 consonants)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18.\n\nNow, let's see if the relation to 81 can come from 18:\n\n\\(18^2 = 324,\\)\nor\n18 * 4.5 = 81.\n\nLet's try the sum of consonants squared and see if it fits the other sets as well.\n\n\n\nFor the next input:\n\n\"office, printer, rooster, scanner, shredder\"\n\n- Office: o, i, e (3 vowels)\n- Printer: i (1 vowel)\n- Rooster: o, o, e (3 vowels)\n- Scanner: a, e (2 vowels)\n- Shredder: e (1 vowel)\n\nTotal number of vowels is: 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nNow let's count consonants for the same input:\n\n- Office: f, c (2 consonants)\n- Printer: p, r, n, t (4 consonants)\n- Rooster: r, s, t, r (4 consonants)\n- Scanner: s, c, n, r (4 consonants)\n- Shredder: s, h, r, d, r (5 consonants)\n\nAdding the consonants:\n\n2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 19\n\nLet's check if 19 fits somehow into the output 100.\n\nIt doesn't seem like \\(19^2 = 361\\) equals 100.\n\nNow let's try summing up the total number of letters for this input:\n\n\"office (5), printer (7), rooster (7), scanner (7), shredder (8).\"\n\nTotal number of letters: \\(5+7 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 34\\).\n\nLet's look at the next input: \"bathroom, shower, dog, toilet, sink.\"\n\nCounting the letters:\n\n- Bathroom = 8 letters\n- Shower = 6 letters\n- Dog = 3 letters\n- Toilet = 6 letters\n- Sink = 4 letters\n\nTotal number of letters = 8 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 27 letters.\n\nThe output is 121.\n\nFor the next input \"classroom, whiteboard, pig, marker, chalk\":\n\nCounting the letters:\n\n- Classroom = 9 letters\n- Whiteboard = 9 letters\n- Pig = 3 letters\n- Marker = 5 letters\n- Chalk = 4 letters\n\nTotal number of letters = 9 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 30 letters.\n\nThe output for this input is 144.\n\nAnd lastly the input \"playground, swing, rat, slide, seesaw\":\n\nCount the letters:\n\n- Playground = 9 letters\n- Swing = 5 letters\n- Rat = 3 letters\n- Slide = 5 letters\n- Seesaw = 6 letters\n\nTotal number of letters = 9 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 28 letters.\n\nThe output for this last input is 1.\n\nLet’s now look at the total number of vowels and total number of consonants for each set, and see if there’s a pattern.\n\nFor \"camera, lens, monkey, tripod, flash\":\n\nVowels:\n\n- camera: a, e (2)\n- lens: e (1)\n- monkey: o, e (2)\n- tripod: o (1)\n- flash: a (1)\n\nTotal vowels = \\(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7.\\)\n\nConsonants = Total Letters - Total Vowels\n\nTotal letters = \\(6 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 27\\).\n\nTotal consonants = \\(27 - 7 = 20.\\)\n\nFor \"office, printer, rooster, scanner, shredder\":\n\nVowels:\n\n- office: o, i, e (3)\n- printer: i (1)\n- rooster: o, o, e (3)\n- scanner: a, e (2)\n- shredder: e (1)\n\nTotal vowels = \\(3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\\).\n\nTotal Letters:\n5 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 34\n\nTotal consonants = 34 - 10 = 24\n\nFor the set \"bathroom, shower, dog, toilet, sink\":\n- Vowels:\n  - Bathroom: a, u, o (3)\n  - Shower: o, e (2)\n  - Dog: o (1)\n  - Toilet: o, i (2)\n  - Sink: i (1)\n\nTotal vowels = 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9\n\nTotal letters = 8 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 27.\n\nTotal consonants = 27 - 9 = 18.\n\nFor \"classroom, whiteboard, pig, marker, chalk\":\n- Vowels:\n  - Classroom: a, o, o (3)\n  - Whiteboard: i, e, o, a (4)\n  - Pig: i (1)\n  - Marker: a, e (2)\n  - Chalk: a (1)\n\nTotal vowels = (3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1) = 11\n\nTotal letters = 9 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 30\n\nTotal consonants = 30 - 11 = 19.\n\nFor the input \"playground, swing, rat, slide, seesaw\":\n- Vowels:\n  - Playground: a, o (2)\n  - Swing: i (1)\n  - Rat: a (1)\n  - Slide: i (1)\n  - Seesaw: e, e, a (3)\n\nTotal vowels = (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3) = 8.\n\nTotal letters = 9 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 28\nTotal consonants = 28 - 8 = 20.\n\nNow let’s check if the square of total vowels, consonants or the total number of letters have a relation to the outputs:\n\n- For the input \"camera, lens, monkey, tripod, flash\":\n  - Total letters = 27\n  - Total vowels = 7.\n  - Total consonants = 20\n\n  Possible square relations: \n\n  \\( \\text{total letters squared}</think> The instruction is: **You need to calculate the sum of the squares of the number of vowels in each word of the given list and then add these squares.

the sum of the number of distinct vowels in each word and sum them across the set.\n\nFor \"workshop, hammer, rabbit, saw, chisel\":\n\n- workshop: distinct vowels are 'o': 1\n- hammer: distinct vowels are 'a': 1\n- rabbit: distinct vowels are 'a', 'i': 2\n- saw: distinct vowels are 'a': 1\n- chisel: distinct vowels are 'i', 'e': 2\n\nNow, sum the number of distinct vowels: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.\n\nAgain, we take the square: 7^2 = 49, clearly incorrect since the output is 16.\n\nLet's try a slightly different approach: sum the number of vowels for each word and take the square root of the given output and see if we can derive a pattern.\n\nFor the input \"market, vendor, tiger, scales, basket,\" we got 9:\nTotal number of vowels = 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nFor the given output 9, $\\sqrt{9} = 3.$\n\nLet's check if this pattern continues:\n\nFor the input \"workshop, hammer, rabbit, saw, chisel\":\n\nCount the number of vowels in each:\n- workshop: 'o', 'o' -> 2 vowels.\n- hammer: 'a' -> 1 vowel.\n- rabbit: 'a', 'i' -> 2 vowels.\n- saw: 'a' -> 1 vowel.\n- chisel: 'i', 'e' -> 2 vowels.\n\nNow add these up:\n\n2 (workshop) + 1 (hammer) + 2 (rabbit) + 1 (saw) + 2 (chisel) = 8\n\nThis should mean the output should be $8^2= 64$, not 16.\n\nIt doesn't seem to work.\n\nLet's now try the method involving the number of distinct vowels across the entire input set.\n\nFor the first set \"market, vendor, tiger, scales, basket\":\n\n- distinct vowels in market: 'a', 'e' -> {a, e}.\n- distinct vowels in vendor: 'e', 'o' -> {e, o}.\n- distinct vowels in tiger: 'i' -> {i}.\n- distinct vowels in scales: 'a', 'e' -> {a, e}.\n- distinct vowels in basket: 'a', 'e' -> {a, e}.\n\nCombining the distinct vowels across all the words:\n\n- From market: {a, e}\n- From vendor: {e, o}\n- From tiger: {i}\n- From scales: {a, e}\n- From basket: {a, e}.\n\nThe distinct vowels across the whole set are the union of these sets:\n\n{a, e} $\\cup$ {e, o} $\\cup$ {i}$\\cup${a, e}$\\cup${a, e}.\n\nBy combining these: {a, e, i, o}. \n\nSo there are 4 distinct vowels in total across the set.\n\nLet's try squaring this number: $4^2 = 16,$ which does not match the output 9.\n\nLet's try the second set \"workshop, hammer, rabbit, saw, chisel\":\n\n- distinct vowels in workshop: 'o' -> {o}.\n- distinct vowels in hammer: 'a' -> {a}.\n- distinct vowels in rabbit: 'a', 'i' ->{a, i}.\n- distinct vowels in saw: 'a' -> {a}.\n- distinct vowels in chisel: 'i', 'e' -> {i, e}.\n\nTake the union of all these sets of distinct vowels:\n\n{ o } $\\cup { a } $\\cup$ {a, i} $\\cup$ {a} $\\cup$ {i, e}.\n\nNow, combine them step by step:\n\n- { o }\n- $\\cup$ {a} = {o, a}\n- $\\cup$ {a, i} = {o, a, i}\n- $\\cup$ {a} = {o, a, i} (no new vowels)\n- $\\cup$ {i, e} = {o, a, i, e}.\n\nSo the distinct vowels set is $\\{o, a, i, e\\}$, which has 4 vowels.\n\nTaking the square: $4^2 = 16.$\n\nThis matches the output 16.\n\nLet’s now try the remaining sets using this method.\n\nFor the third input: \"village, house, dragon, neighbor, community\":\n\nDistinct vowels in:\n\n- \"village\": 'i', 'e' -> {i, e}.\n- \"house\": 'o', 'u' -> {o, u}.\n- \"dragon\": 'a', 'o' -> {a, o}.\n- \"neighbor\": 'e', 'i', 'o' -> {e, i, o}.\n- \"community\": 'u', 'i', 'e' -> {u, i, e}.\n\nNow take the union of these sets:\n\n1.
