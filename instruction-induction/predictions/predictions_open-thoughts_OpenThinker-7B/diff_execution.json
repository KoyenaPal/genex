So, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to reverse-engineer the rule that connects each input pair to the output. Let me start by listing out all the given data points.\n\nFirst, the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. Input: 58 29 → Output: 29\n2. Input: 88 20 → Output: 68\n3. Input: 94 43 → Output: 51\n4. Input: 86 37 → Output: 49\n5. Input: 13 5 → Output: 8\n\nHmm. Let's look at each input pair and see if there's a pattern between them and the output. Maybe it's a mathematical operation or some combination of operations on the two numbers in the input.\n\nLet me list the inputs and outputs again:\n\n1. (58,29) → 29\n2. (88,20) → 68\n3. (94,43) → 51\n4. (86,37) → 49\n5. (13,5) → 8\n\nLooking at the first input pair: 58 and 29. The output is 29. That suggests that maybe the second number in the input is the output. But wait, let's check the others. For example, the second input is 88 and 20, output is 68. If we take the second number (20) and do something with it, like subtract from the first number (88-20=68), that gives the output. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nCheck the first input: 58 -29 =29. Oh! That works. Let's verify with the other inputs.\n\nSecond input: 88 -20 =68. Correct.\n\nThird input:94 -43=51. Yes, matches the output.\n\nFourth input:86-37=49. Correct.\n\nFifth input:13-5=8. Exactly the output.\n\nSo, the instruction seems to be \"Subtract the second number from the first number.\" That would explain all the output pairs. Let me double-check each one:\n\n1. 58-29=29 ✔️\n2. 88-20=68 ✔️\n3. 94-43=51 ✔️\n4. 86-37=49 ✔️\n5. 13-5=8 ✔️\n\nAll of them fit. So the instruction must be to subtract the second input value from the first. That's straightforward. I don't see any other possible operations that could fit here. For example, adding, multiplying, or combining digits. Let's see if there's another way, but the subtraction seems to work perfectly.

Hmm, so there are five input-output pairs here. Let me list them again to get a clear view.\n\nFirst pair: Input is 120 and 52, Output is 68.\nSecond: 157 and 61 → 96.\nThird: 109 and 14 → 95.\nFourth: 108 and 12 → 96.\nFifth: 84 and 26 → 58.\n\nI need to find a relationship between each pair of numbers (the two numbers in the input) and the single number in the output. Let's start by looking at each input-output pair individually and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with the first one: 120 and 52 make 68. Let's think about possible operations. Maybe subtraction? 120 - 52 = 68. Oh, wait! That works. Let me check the next ones.\n\nSecond pair: 157 - 61 = 96. Yep, that's exactly the output. Third pair: 109 -14=95. Fourth: 108-12=96. Fifth: 84-26=58. All of these results match the outputs given. So, does this mean the instruction was simply subtract the two numbers?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If all the outputs are just the difference between the two inputs, then yes. But maybe there's a twist. Let me verify each calculation again.\n\nFirst input: 120 -52. 120 minus 50 is 70, minus 2 more is 68. Correct. Second: 157-61. 157-60=97, minus 1 is 96. Third: 109-14. 109-10=99, minus 4=95. Fourth: 108-12=96. Fifth: 84-26=58. All correct. So the pattern seems to be straightforward subtraction.\n\nBut wait, why would the friend write such a simple instruction? Maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. Are there any other possible operations that could result in these outputs? For example, addition, multiplication, division, or some combination.\n\nLet's test another possibility. Suppose the instruction was to add the two numbers and then divide by something. Let's see:\n\nFirst pair: (120+52)=172. If divided by 2.5, that's 68.8, which isn't 68. Not matching. Second pair: 157+61=218. Divided by 2.27... not 96. Doesn't work. So addition followed by division doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about multiplication? 120*52=6240. No way that gives 68. Similarly, 157*61 is way larger than 96. So no.\n\nDivision: 120/52 ≈2.307, not 68. 157/61≈2.557. Nope. So division isn't it.\n\nSubtraction seems to fit perfectly. Let me check if there's any case where subtraction might not work. For example, if the second number is larger than the first. Wait, in the third input, 109-14=95. All the inputs have the first number larger than the second. So subtraction is valid here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take the smaller number and subtract it from the larger one. Which is essentially what subtraction does when the order is correct. Since all inputs have the first number larger than the second, subtracting them gives the correct output.\n\nSo, the instruction is likely \"Subtract the second number from the first number.\" Therefore, the output is simply the difference between the two input values.\n\nBut let me check once more to ensure there's no alternative interpretation. For example, maybe the instruction involved some other operation like modulo or bitwise operations. Let's see:\n\nTake the first pair: 120 mod 52. 52*2=104, 120-104=16. 16 mod 52 is 16. Not 68. Doesn't fit. Second pair: 157 mod 61. 61*2=122, 157-122=35. 35 mod 61 is 35. Not 96. So no.\n\nBitwise operations? Let's see. For example, XOR. 120 in binary is 01111000, 52 is 00110100. XOR gives 01001100 which is 76. Not 68. Doesn't match. OR: 01111100 is 124. Not 68. AND: 00110000 is 48. Not 68. So bitwise operations don't seem to fit.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to take the average of the two numbers and round to the nearest integer. Let's check:\n\nFirst pair: (120+52)/2=86. Not 68. Second: (157+61)/2=109. Not 96. So no.\n\nOr perhaps the sum of the digits? Let's see. For 120 and 52: 1+2+0 +5+2=10. Not 68. 157+61:1+5+7+6+1=19. Not 96. So no.\n\nHmm. What about concatenation? Like writing the two numbers together and then doing something. For example, 12052. But how would that relate to 68? Not obvious. Or maybe the last two digits? 120 ends with 20, 52 ends with 52. Not sure. Doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take the first number minus the second, but only if the first is greater than the second. Which is exactly what subtraction does here. Since all inputs have the first number larger than the second, subtraction works.\n\nAnother angle: Could the instruction involve some other mathematical operation applied to both numbers before subtracting? For example, multiply the first by something and subtract the second. Let's see:\n\nLooking for constants a and b such that a*first + b*second = output. Let's set up equations for the first two pairs.\n\nFor first pair: 120a +52b=68\nSecond pair:157a +61b=96\n\nWe can solve this system. Let's subtract the first equation multiplied by (96/68) from the second equation. Wait, maybe better to use substitution.\n\nFrom first equation: 120a =68 -52b → a=(68-52b)/120\n\nPlug into second equation:\n\n157*(68-52b)/120 +61b=96\n\nMultiply through by 120 to eliminate denominator:\n\n157*(68-52b) +61b*120=96*120\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n157*68 = 10616\n\n157*(-52b) = -8164b\n\n61b*120=7320b\n\nSo total left side: 10616 -8164b +7320b =10616 -844b\n\nRight side: 11520\n\nSo equation: 10616 -844b =11520\n\nSubtract 10616: -844b=904\n\nDivide by -844: b= -904/844 ≈-1.068\n\nNot an integer. So this approach may not work unless there's a specific ratio. Since the outputs are integers, maybe a and b are fractions. But this seems complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose the instruction was to compute (first - second) * k, where k is some constant. Let's see:\n\nFor first pair: (120-52)*k=68 →68k=68 →k=1. Then check second pair: (157-61)*1=96. Yes, that works. Third pair: (109-14)*1=95. Correct. Fourth: (108-12)*1=96. Fifth: (84-26)*1=58. All correct. So this also fits. So the instruction could be \"subtract the second number from the first and multiply by 1\", which is just subtraction.\n\nTherefore, the simplest explanation is that the instruction was to subtract the second input from the first input.

So, we have five input-output pairs, and the friend followed some rule to get those outputs from the inputs. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given pairs again to see if there's any obvious pattern:\n\n1. Input: 92 13 → Output: 79\n2. Input: 72 36 → Output: 36\n3. Input: 92 3 → Output: 89\n4. Input: 62 12 → Output: 50\n5. Input: 46 23 → Output: 23\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking at each pair individually and see if there's a mathematical operation or transformation that connects them.\n\nStarting with the first pair: 92 and 13 become 79. Let's subtract them: 92-13=79. Oh! That works here. Let me check the others.\n\nSecond pair: 72-36=36. That's exactly the output. So that's another subtraction. Interesting. Third pair: 92-3=89. Again, subtraction gives the output. Fourth pair: 62-12=50. Yep, same result. Fifth pair: 46-23=23. Also subtraction. Wait a minute, so in all cases, the output is the difference between the two numbers? Let me verify again.\n\nFirst input: 92-13=79 ✔️\nSecond: 72-36=36 ✔️\nThird: 92-3=89 ✔️\nFourth: 62-12=50 ✔️\nFifth: 46-23=23 ✔️\n\nAll of these outputs match the difference of the two numbers. So maybe the instruction was \"Subtract the second number from the first.\" But wait, let me make sure there's no other possible interpretation. Sometimes, instructions can be more complex, like modulo operations or something else. Let me check if there's any case where subtraction doesn't hold.\n\nLooking back at all pairs, subtraction seems consistent. For example, 72-36=36, which is exactly the output. 92-3=89, which matches. All others also fit. So perhaps the simplest answer is subtraction. But let me think again—could there be another operation?\n\nWait, let's consider if the instruction might involve some other operation. For instance, maybe the first number minus the second, but only when certain conditions are met. But in all cases, it's just straightforward subtraction. Let me check if any of the outputs could be achieved through another method. For example, maybe the first number divided by the second, rounded down? Let's test that.\n\nTake the first pair: 92/13 ≈7.07, floor is 7. Not 79. Doesn't work. Second pair:72/36=2. Not 36. Third pair:92/3≈30.66→30. Not 89. So that's not it.\n\nWhat about addition? First pair:92+13=105≠79. No. Second pair:72+36=108≠36. Nope. Multiplication: 92*13=1196≠79. Definitely not. So subtraction seems the only viable option.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a different way to interpret the inputs. Are the inputs two numbers, and the output is their difference? Yes. But maybe the instruction is phrased differently. For example, \"Subtract the second number from the first,\" which would give the same result as the difference. Alternatively, \"Compute the absolute difference between the two numbers,\" but since all outputs are positive (assuming inputs are positive), absolute value isn't necessary here.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the instruction involves some other operation, but the examples all fit subtraction. Let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe the first number minus the second, but only if the first is larger than the second. But in all cases, the first number is larger than the second. So that's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to subtract the second number from the first, but then add something else. But in all cases, the output is exactly the difference. So that's not needed.\n\nWait, let's check the third input: 92 3 → 89. 92-3=89. Correct. Fourth input:62-12=50. Correct. Fifth:46-23=23. Correct. So all outputs are simply the first number minus the second. Therefore, the instruction must be to subtract the second number from the first.\n\nBut let me double-check once more. Suppose the instruction was \"Subtract the second number from the first,\" which would directly lead to the outputs given. There's no other plausible operation that fits all these pairs.

So we have five input-output pairs here. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. Input: 164 69 → Output: 95\n2. Input: 66 30 → Output: 36\n3. Input: 47 4 → Output: 43\n4. Input: 76 6 → Output: 70\n5. Input: 120 50 → Output: 70\n\nHmm. The instruction is probably some mathematical operation or combination of operations applied to the two numbers in each input pair. Let's start by looking at each pair and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's note that all outputs are single-digit numbers except for the last one, which is 70. Wait, no—the first output is 95, which is two digits. Wait, but the outputs given are 95, 36, 43, 70, 70. So some are two-digit, others are one-digit. That might complicate things. But maybe the instruction involves combining the two numbers into a single number, then performing some operation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a digit-wise operation. Let's check each input-output pair.\n\nLet's take the first pair: 164 and 69. The output is 95. Let's see what could happen here. Maybe subtract the two numbers? 164 - 69 = 95. Oh! That works for the first pair. Let's check the others.\n\nSecond input: 66 and 30. 66 - 30 = 36. Which matches the output. Third input: 47 - 4 = 43. That's correct. Fourth input: 76 - 6 = 70. Correct. Fifth input: 120 - 50 = 70. Also correct. Wait a minute, so all these outputs are just the result of subtracting the second number from the first. So the instruction was \"Subtract the second number from the first.\" But wait, let's verify again.\n\nYes, for each input pair (a, b), the output is a - b. Let's check all:\n\n1. 164 - 69 = 95 ✔️\n2. 66 - 30 = 36 ✔️\n3. 47 - 4 = 43 ✔️\n4. 76 - 6 = 70 ✔️\n5. 120 - 50 = 70 ✔️\n\nAll of them match. So the instruction must be to subtract the second number from the first. That seems straightforward. But why did the user present this as a problem? Maybe there's a trick here. Let me double-check if there's any other possible interpretation.\n\nWait, sometimes in such puzzles, the numbers might be concatenated instead of subtracted. For example, 164 and 69 concatenated would be 16469, but that doesn't lead to 95. Alternatively, maybe adding the digits? Let's see:\n\nFor 164 and 69: 1+6+4 + 6+9 = 11 + 15 = 26. Not 95. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying the digits? 1*6*4=24, 6*9=54. No. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers minus something. Let's see:\n\nFor 164 + 69 = 233. 233 - 138 = 95. Hmm, not sure where 138 comes from. Doesn't seem systematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the difference between the two numbers when they are treated as numbers in some base. For example, if the numbers are in base 10, but perhaps converted to another base first. Let's test that.\n\nTake 164 and 69. If we convert them to base 10, subtract, that's 95. But if we convert them to another base, say base 16, but that seems complicated. Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the product of the two numbers modulo something. Let's check:\n\n164 * 69 = 11316. 11316 mod 118 = 11316 / 118 = 95.5... So remainder 95. Wait, 118 * 95 = 11230. 11316 - 11230 = 86. Not 95. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers divided by something. For example, 164 + 69 = 233. 233 / 2.5 = 93.2, not 95. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the average of the two numbers rounded to the nearest integer. 164 +69=233/2=116.5 → 117, which isn't 95. So no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction involves some other operation on the digits. For example, take the digits of the two numbers, combine them in some way. Let's look at the first input: 164 and 69. The digits are 1,6,4 and 6,9. Maybe concatenate them in some order. 16469 → 16469 - 69 = 163990? No, that's not 95. Alternatively, maybe add the digits of both numbers. 1+6+4 +6+9=26. Not 95.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the squares of the digits. For 164: 1² +6² +4²=1+36+16=53. For 69:6²+9²=36+81=117. 53+117=170. Not 95. Doesn't work.\n\nHmm. So subtraction seems to fit all cases. Let's check the fifth input: 120 and 50. 120-50=70. Correct. So yes, the instruction is to subtract the second number from the first. Therefore, the answer should be \"Subtract the second number from the first.\"\n\nBut wait, the problem says the friend read the instruction and wrote the outputs. So the instruction is likely a simple mathematical operation. Since all the outputs are indeed the result of a - b, where a is the first number and b is the second, then that's the instruction.\n\nI think that's the solution.

So, we have five input-output pairs, and each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. The goal is to find the rule that transforms the pair (a, b) into c.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given pairs:\n\n1. Input: 86 21 → Output: 65\n2. Input: 115 55 → Output: 60\n3. Input: 87 41 → Output: 46\n4. Input: 141 61 → Output: 80\n5. Input: 52 5 → Output: 47\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking at each input and output and see if there's a pattern. Maybe it's a mathematical operation between the two numbers. Let's consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, or some combination.\n\nLet me check each input-output pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair: 86 and 21. The output is 65. Let's see:\n\nIf we subtract them: 86 - 21 = 65. Oh! That works for the first pair. Let's check the others.\n\nSecond pair: 115 - 55 = 60. That matches the output. Third pair: 87 - 41 = 46. Also matches. Fourth pair: 141 - 61 = 80. Yep, that's correct. Fifth pair: 52 - 5 = 47. Exactly the output. \n\nWait a minute, so the instruction might be \"Subtract the second number from the first.\" But let me double-check each pair to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst input: 86-21=65 ✔️  \nSecond: 115-55=60 ✔️  \nThird: 87-41=46 ✔️  \nFourth: 141-61=80 ✔️  \nFifth: 52-5=47 ✔️  \n\nAll of them check out. So the instruction is simply subtracting the second input value from the first. That seems straightforward. But wait, maybe there's another way to look at it? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, could it be something else? For example, maybe adding the digits of the two numbers? Let's test that.\n\nTake the first input: 86 and 21. Sum of digits: 8+6 + 2+1 = 14+3=17. Not 65. Doesn't work.\n\nOr maybe multiplying the two numbers? 86*21=1806, which is way larger than 65. No.\n\nWhat about concatenating the two numbers? 8621 vs 65. Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the difference between the two numbers. Wait, but in the first case, 86-21=65. Then 115-55=60, etc. So yes, that's exactly the same as subtracting the second from the first. So this seems to fit all cases.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible operation. For example, maybe modulo. Let's see:\n\nTake 86 mod 21. 21*4=84, so 86-84=2. 2 mod 21 is 2. Not 65. Doesn't work.\n\nHow about division? 86 divided by 21 is approximately 4.095, not 65. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers minus something. Let's see:\n\nFor the first pair: 86+21=107. 107-42=65. But why 42? Not obvious. Let's check others:\n\n115+55=170. 170-110=60. Hmm, 110 is 55*2. But 55*2=110. So 170-110=60. Then third pair: 87+41=128. 128-82=46. 82 is 41*2. Fourth pair: 141+61=202. 202-140=62. But output is 80. Doesn't fit. So that approach doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product plus something. 86*21=1806. 1806 + (something) =65. No, that's impossible.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the output is related to the digits of the numbers. For example, take the first digit of the first number and add it to the last digit of the second number. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 8 (first digit of 86) + 1 (last digit of 21) =9. Not 65. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the digits of both numbers. First input: 8+6+2+1=17. Not 65. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers minus the product of their digits. Let's check:\n\nFirst pair: 86+21=107. Product of digits: 8*6*2*1=96. 107-96=11. Not 65. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers minus the sum of their digits. For first pair: 86+21=107. Sum of digits: 8+6+2+1=17. 107-17=90. Not 65.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers divided by something. Let's see:\n\nFirst pair: 107 / something =65. 107/65≈1.646. Not an integer. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the average of the two numbers multiplied by something. 86+21=107. 107/2=53.5. 53.5 * something=65. 65/53.5≈1.216. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the first number minus the second, then multiplied by something. Like (a - b)*k = c. Let's see:\n\nFor first pair: 65 = (86-21)*k → k=65/65=1. So k=1. Then check other pairs:\n\nSecond pair: 115-55=60. 60*1=60. Correct. Third pair: 87-41=46. 46*1=46. Correct. Fourth pair: 141-61=80. 80*1=80. Correct. Fifth pair:52-5=47. 47*1=47. Correct. So this seems to fit all pairs. Therefore, the instruction is to subtract the second number from the first.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the friend read the instruction and wrote the outputs. So the instruction must be clear. If the instruction was \"Subtract the second number from the first,\" then that would explain all the outputs. But maybe there's another way to phrase it. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is \"Compute the difference between the two numbers,\" which would also mean subtracting the second from the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is written in a different language, but since the user is in English, that's unlikely. So the most straightforward answer is that the instruction is to subtract the second input number from the first.\n\nBut let me just confirm once more. All pairs fit the subtraction model. So unless there's a trick or a hidden step, this seems solid. I don't see any other possible operations that would fit all these pairs. So the answer should be subtracting the second number from the first.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **subtract the second number from the first**. This can be verified by checking each input-output pair:\n\n1. \\(86 - 21 = 65\\)  \n2. \\(115 - 55 = 60\\)  \n3. \\(87 - 41 = 46\\)  \n4. \\(141 - 61 = 80\\)  \n5. \\(52 - 5 = 47\\)  \n\nEach output matches the result of subtracting the second input value from the first. Thus, the systematic process confirms the solution. \n\n**Answer:** Subtract the second input number from the first.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"
