Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? Let's check each example:\n\n1. Original is casual (\"See you\"), output is more formal and uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\".\n2. \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So replacing \"thanks\" with \"assistance\", adding \"much appreciated\".\n3. \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\". Both mean not true, but \"fabricated\" is more formal.\n4. \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So changing the phrasing from negative to neutral, using \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't\".\n5. \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\". Here, \"many\" is replaced with \"various\", which is a synonym but more formal.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. Let's verify each example against this hypothesis.\n\n1. Original is casual. Output uses \"look forward to\" (polite) instead of \"see you\".\n2. \"Thanks\" is replaced with \"Your assistance\", which is more formal. \"Much appreciated\" adds emphasis.\n3. \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (formal).\n4. \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\" (more polite and less direct).\n5. \"many approaches\" → \"various approaches\" (synonym, more formal).\n\nAnother possible angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more positive or appreciative tone. For example, the second input's output is more positive than the original. But the first input's output is also more formal but not necessarily positive. However, the third input's output is more formal but not positive. The fourth and fifth examples don't seem to add positivity, just formality.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about converting present tense to past? Let's check:\n\nOriginal 3: \"was made up\" → output \"was fabricated\". Both are past tense. So no, that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs or phrases with synonyms. For example, \"considered\" in input 5 becomes \"various approaches were considered\" – but that's a slight change in structure. Wait, input 5's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"considered\" remains, but \"many\" is replaced with \"various\".\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts. Let's see:\n\n- \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal)\n- \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance\" (more formal)\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (same meaning, more formal)\n- \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (less direct, more formal)\n- \"considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\" (replacing \"many\" with \"various\", which is a synonym but more formal)\n\nYes, this seems consistent. So the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. Alternatively, it could be about converting the input into a more positive or appreciative tone, but looking at all examples, the primary change seems to be formality rather than positivity.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to make the output more positive by rephrasing. For example, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is slightly more positive. Similarly, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is more positive. However, the other examples don't fit this pattern as well. For instance, \"See you tonight\" becomes a more formal greeting, but not necessarily positive. So maybe the main focus is on formality rather than positivity.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about converting the input into a more indirect or euphemistic expression? For example, \"made up\" is a direct way to say something isn't true, whereas \"fabricated\" is a more formal term. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" is direct, while \"find it hard to distinguish\" is more indirect. But this seems like a secondary aspect compared to formality.\n\nPutting it all together, the most consistent instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. This aligns with all the examples provided. Therefore, the instruction was likely something along the lines of \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite tone,\" or \"Convert the input into a more formal expression by replacing informal terms with their more formal counterparts.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, typically by replacing informal or direct expressions with their more formal equivalents. This transformation emphasizes politeness, formality, and clarity.

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nWait, so the output is replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and changing \"stand\" to \"tolerate\". But why? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using synonyms. Let's check another pair to see if this holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the output changes \"considered\" to \"were considered\" and adds \"various\" before approaches. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into passive voice and add descriptive adjectives where possible. Let's check the third pair.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like a completely different structure. The original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea to do anything, but the output is a suggestion to take no action. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a positive suggestion, possibly using formal language. That makes sense. The output is more formal and uses \"it is suggested\" instead of a direct statement.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the output replaces the relative pronoun \"I\" with \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to convert the relative pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\" in cases where it refers to the subject. But wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. However, the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. Wait, that might not make sense. Unless the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of a preposition. Let me check the original input. The original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom\". That seems odd unless there's a preposition involved. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why does the output have \"whom\"? That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts, but that doesn't align with the output here. Hmm, maybe this pair isn't following the same rule as the others. Let me hold onto that thought and check the fifth pair.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHere, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So again, synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms. But then why does the fourth pair involve changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? That seems inconsistent. Unless the instruction was more complex, combining multiple transformations.\n\nWait, looking back at the fourth pair: the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\". But in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. However, the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. This suggests that perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition. But in this case, there's no preposition. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition that I missed. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" No preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the input-output pair, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the context. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use the objective case whenever possible, regardless of the preposition. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that would change the meaning. For example, \"I met\" becomes \"me met\", which is grammatically incorrect. So that can't be right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a question, but the outputs don't look like questions. Let's see. First output is a statement, second is a statement, third is a suggestion, fourth is a statement, fifth is a statement. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common transformations. Let's list the changes:\n\n1. Input: \"can't stand\" → Output: \"cannot tolerate\"\n   - Synonym replacement: \"can't\" vs \"cannot\", \"stand\" vs \"tolerate\"\n\n2. Input: \"considered many approaches\" → Output: \"various approaches were considered\"\n   - Passive voice conversion (\"considered\" → \"were considered\") and addition of \"various\"\n\n3. Input: \"don't think it's a good idea to do anything\" → Output: \"it is suggested that no action should be taken\"\n   - Replacing the original statement with a suggestion, changing the structure entirely\n\n4. Input: \"lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → Output: \"lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\"\n   - Changing \"I\" to \"whom\"\n\n5. Input: \"whole story was made up\" → Output: \"entire story was fabricated\"\n   - Synonym replacement: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n\nSo, the first, third, and fifth pairs involve synonym replacement. The second involves passive voice and adjective addition. The fourth involves changing the relative pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\". \n\nNow, the challenge is to find a single instruction that could cover all these transformations. Let's think about possible instructions.\n\nPossibility 1: The instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a more formal or standard version. For example, replacing contractions, changing verb tenses, adding adjectives, etc. But the fourth pair doesn't fit this, as it's about changing the relative pronoun.\n\nPossibility 2: The instruction was to convert each sentence into a different type of sentence structure. For example, the first pair is a contraction to a full form, the second is active to passive, the third is a suggestion, the fourth is changing pronouns, the fifth is synonym replacement. But this seems too vague.\n\nPossibility 3: The instruction was to apply specific transformations based on certain criteria. For example, replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\", changing \"I\" to \"me\" or \"whom\", converting to passive voice, etc. But how?\n\nLooking at the fourth pair again: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". If the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition, but in this case, there's no preposition. Unless the original input had a preposition that was removed. Wait, maybe the input was different. Let me check again. The user provided the input as \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? This is puzzling. Maybe there's a typo in the input-output pair. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that would make the sentence \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful,\" which is grammatically incorrect. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a question, but the outputs don't look like questions. For example, the first output is a statement, not a question. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the possible instruction that could lead to all these outputs. Let's think about possible transformations:\n\n- For the first pair: replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and \"stand\" with \"tolerate\".\n- Second pair: passive voice and adding \"various\".\n- Third pair: rephrasing into a suggestion.\n- Fourth pair: changing \"I\" to \"whom\".\n- Fifth pair: synonym replacement.\n\nHmm. The fourth pair is the only one that involves changing the relative pronoun. So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a different type of clause, such as turning it into a relative clause with a different pronoun. But why \"whom\" specifically? Unless the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of a verb. Wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. That doesn't fit unless there's a preposition involved. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition that was omitted. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? This is confusing. Maybe the input was different.

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to determine what the initial instruction was. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied to each input to get the output.\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, let's analyze each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\n- The original sentence starts with \"I think...\" and the output changes it to \"It is my opinion that...\". So here, the subject is shifted from \"I\" to \"It\", and the verb phrase is rephrased using \"is my opinion that\".\n\nSecond input-output:\n- Original is a question starting with \"Do you...\", and the output is a more formal version using \"Shall I accompany you?\". The structure here is changing the question into a suggestion phrased as a third-person imperative.\n\nThird input:\n- \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object \"what you said\" is simplified to \"you\".\n\nFourth input:\n- \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" The adjective \"fire\" is replaced with a more elaborate description. \"Fire\" is slang for something really good, so the output uses a more formal equivalent.\n\nFifth input:\n- \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The original is a negative statement about not being able to differentiate, and the output rephrases it using \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's categorize possible instruction types:\n\n1. **Rephrasing for Formality**: Some outputs seem more formal. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" or \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\". But not all inputs are made more formal—like the third input where \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", which might be more direct but not necessarily formal.\n\n2. **Replacing Slang/Colloquialisms**: The fourth input's \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\", which is a more standard adjective. Similarly, maybe other informal expressions are being converted to more formal terms.\n\n3. **Changing Sentence Structure**: The first input changes the subject and adds \"my opinion\", while the second input changes the question into a suggestion phrased as a command. The fifth input changes the negative structure into a different phrasing.\n\nWait, but the third input doesn't change the structure much. It just replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". Maybe that's a simplification rather than a structural change.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in the outputs. For example, \"think\" becomes \"opinion\", \"want\" becomes \"accompany\", \"got\" becomes \"understood\", \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good\", \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. Let's check:\n\n- First input: Changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" could be seen as making it more formal. Similarly, the second input's \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a more polite way to ask for permission or agreement. Third input: \"I got what you said\" is a bit informal; replacing with \"I understood you\" is more direct but maybe less formal. Fourth input: \"fire\" is slang, replaced with a more descriptive term. Fifth input: \"can't tell the difference\" is rephrased into a more formal expression.\n\nBut some of these don't fit the \"formal\" category. For example, the third input's output is more direct but not necessarily formal. So maybe the instruction isn't strictly about formality.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: \"fire\" is slang for excellent. The output uses \"incredibly good\", which is a more standard way to express high quality. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal or slang expressions with more formal or standard equivalents.\n\nSimilarly, the first input's output uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\", which might be considered more formal. The second input's output is a more polite way to ask someone to go along. The fifth input's output is a more formal way to express difficulty distinguishing.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents. Alternatively, it could be to translate the input into a more formal register, adjusting vocabulary and sentence structure accordingly.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" – formal rephrasing.\n2. \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" – polite request.\n3. \"I got...\" → \"I understood...\" – more direct but maybe slightly more formal.\n4. \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with standard adjective.\n5. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – formal rephrasing.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The instruction likely asked the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction could be to convert questions into statements or vice versa, but looking at the examples, only the second input is a question, and its output is a statement. However, the first input is a statement becoming another statement, third is a statement to another statement, fourth is a statement to another statement, fifth is a statement to another statement. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make each input more assertive. For example, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\", which is more assertive. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a suggestion rather than a question. \"I got...\" becomes \"I understood...\", which is more direct. \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\", which is a stronger assertion. \"Can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a more formal way of expressing inability.\n\nSo the key here is that the instruction required the friend to rephrase each input into a more assertive or formal version, possibly replacing informal expressions with more standard ones. Therefore, the original instruction was likely something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version**, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents. This explains the observed transformations across all input-output pairs:\n\n1. **Formalization**:  \n   - \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" (assertive rephrasing).  \n   - \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (polite suggestion).  \n\n2. **Slang Replacement**:  \n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (standard adjective).  \n\n3. **Directness and Formality**:  \n   - \"I got...\" → \"I understood...\" (slightly more direct).  \n   - \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (formal rephrasing).  \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>",

    "instruction_outputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: Do you want me to go with you?\nOutput: Shall I accompany you?\n\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out the instruction that the friend used to generate these outputs from the inputs. Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see what transformation or rule was applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Let's break that down. The original question is in the second person, asking if the speaker should go along. The output is a more formal version using \"Shall\" and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into more polite or formal statements, replacing certain verbs and adjusting the sentence structure.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the output is a more elaborate way of expressing gratitude. Instead of a simple \"thanks\", it's expanded into a longer sentence that emphasizes the value of the help received. So perhaps the instruction involves converting expressions of thanks into more detailed or formal expressions of appreciation.\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This seems like a direct translation but with a slight change in wording. \"Can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction is to replace informal phrases with their more formal equivalents, especially when expressing inability to endure something.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the original statement is a concise way of saying they understood. The output is a more active voice and uses \"understood\" instead of \"got what you said\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase affirmative statements into more formal or direct expressions of comprehension.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" The main change here is the addition of \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". The original uses a relative clause without specifying the relative pronoun, while the output uses \"whom\" to make it more formal. So maybe the instruction is to add relative pronouns (like \"whom\") to make the sentences more formal or grammatically correct according to certain rules.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, the instruction might be to convert the given input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check each case again:\n\n1. Question to more formal question with \"Shall\" and rephrasing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you\".\n2. Gratitude expressed as a longer, more elaborate sentence.\n3. Informal \"can't stand\" replaced with \"cannot tolerate\".\n4. Concise \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\" for clarity.\n5. Removing the relative clause's ambiguity by adding \"whom\".\n\nWait, but the fifth input's output adds \"whom\", which changes the grammar. So maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more formal by adding specific relative pronouns where appropriate. But why only in the fifth case? Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using different structures and vocabulary. For example:\n\n- Convert questions into more formal interrogative forms.\n- Expand short expressions of gratitude into longer, more appreciative statements.\n- Replace informal verb phrases with their more formal counterparts.\n- Use more formal or direct expressions for agreement or understanding.\n- Add relative pronouns to clarify relationships in clauses.\n\nBut looking at the fifth example, the original doesn't have any relative clause issues. The output adds \"whom\" to the relative clause \"I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to ensure that all relative clauses use the correct relative pronoun, even if the original didn't specify. For example, in the fifth input, the original uses \"I met yesterday\" without a relative pronoun, but the output adds \"whom\" to make it explicit. That could be part of making the sentence more formal by adhering to strict grammar rules.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely involves transforming each input into a more formal version by applying several rules:\n\n1. Convert questions into more polite or formal interrogative forms (e.g., replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany\").\n2. Expand expressions of gratitude into more elaborate or formal statements (e.g., \"much appreciated\" instead of \"thanks\").\n3. Replace informal verb phrases with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n4. Rephrase affirmative statements into clearer or more direct expressions (e.g., \"I understood you\" instead of \"I got what you said\").\n5. Ensure that relative clauses use the correct relative pronoun (e.g., adding \"whom\" in the fifth example).\n\nAdditionally, the fifth example might also involve making the sentence more formal by specifying the relative pronoun, which wasn't present in the original. So the instruction could include both grammar corrections and style adjustments.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to follow a pattern of increasing formality and specificity. For instance, the first output uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", which is a more formal verb choice. The second output uses \"assistance\" and \"appreciated\" which are more formal terms. The third uses \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\", which is a bit more formal. The fourth uses \"understood\" instead of \"got\", which is more direct. The fifth adds \"whom\" to clarify the relative clause.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite version by rephrasing questions, expanding expressions of gratitude, replacing informal verb phrases with their formal equivalents, rephrasing affirmative statements for clarity, and ensuring grammatical correctness by adding relative pronouns where necessary.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth example's output doesn't just add \"whom\"; it changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So the instruction might specifically require adding the relative pronoun \"whom\" in such cases. However, in the original input, the relative clause was \"I met yesterday\", which is a valid relative clause without a pronoun. Adding \"whom\" makes it more formal. So perhaps the instruction includes a rule to add \"whom\" whenever the relative clause refers to the subject of the main clause.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to always use the relative pronoun \"whom\" in such clauses to make them more formal. But that would be a stylistic choice rather than a grammatical correction. However, in standard English, \"whom\" is often omitted in modern usage, so adding it could be seen as making the sentence more formal.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction is likely to transform each input into a more formal version by applying these various stylistic and grammatical adjustments. Therefore, the instruction given to the friend was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite expression, possibly including changes in verb form, sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar (like adding relative pronouns) to enhance formality.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Question Handling**: Convert questions into more polite or formal interrogative forms.

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. So the instruction must have been something like \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone\" or similar. But wait, looking at the outputs, there are different transformations. Let me check each pair again.\n\nFirst input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So here, the question is changed from present tense (\"do\") to past tense (\"be able to accomplish\"), and the phrasing is more formal. The second input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the first-person perspective is replaced with a more formal \"it is my opinion\". Third input: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" vs. \"entire\", and \"made up\" vs. \"fabricated\"—both are synonyms but more formal. Fourth input: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This changes the informal greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. Fifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Again, changing the question structure and using more formal terms like \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\".\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Alternatively, maybe it's about converting questions into statements or changing tenses. Wait, but not all outputs are just formalizing. For example, the third input is a synonym substitution without changing formality. The fourth input changes the greeting into a more formal expression. The fifth input changes the question structure and uses a more formal verb (\"accompany\" vs. \"want me to go\"). \n\nLooking at the outputs, some are more about politeness (like \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want...\"), others are about formality (changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), and some are about rephrasing questions into statements or different structures. But the common thread seems to be that the outputs are more formal or polite versions of the inputs. However, the third input's output is a synonym but not necessarily more formal. Wait, \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their more formal equivalents while maintaining the meaning. But then why does the second input change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\"? That's a structural change rather than just a word replacement. Similarly, the fourth input changes \"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\", which is a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite or formal version, possibly involving changing the sentence structure, replacing contractions, or using more formal language. Let's see:\n\n- First input: Change \"can you\" to \"would you be able to accomplish\", which is more formal and uses \"be able to\" instead of \"can\".\n- Second input: Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", which is a more formal way of expressing personal belief.\n- Third input: Synonym substitution with \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" as more formal terms.\n- Fourth input: Change the informal greeting \"See you\" into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n- Fifth input: Change the question \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\", which is a more formal way of asking for permission or assistance.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite manner, possibly by restructuring the sentence, replacing contractions, or using more formal vocabulary.\" Alternatively, it might specifically ask to convert questions into statements or use more polite phrasing. But looking at the outputs, the second and fifth examples involve changing the sentence structure entirely (from first-person statements to third-person statements, and from questions to statements). The first example changes \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\", which is a more formal structure. The third example is a synonym substitution. The fourth example changes the greeting into a more formal expression. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve various transformations depending on the context.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some are more about politeness (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\"), others about formality (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"). The second input's output is a structural change from first-person to third-person. The fourth input's output is a complete rephrasing of the greeting. So maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more polite or formal, which can include various methods like changing the subject, using more formal language, or restructuring the sentence.\n\nBut how to formulate the instruction that would lead to all these outputs? Let's consider possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version.\"\n2. \"Rearrange each sentence into a more polite or formal structure.\"\n3. \"Rephrase each input using more formal language, including synonyms and sentence structure changes.\"\n4. \"Polite your responses by using more formal expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements or use more formal phrasing. For example, the first input is a question, and the output is a statement. The fifth input is a question, and the output is a statement. The second input is a statement, and the output is a statement. The fourth input is a greeting, and the output is a statement. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, regardless of the original type. But the third input's output is a synonym, not a statement. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, the third input's output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" which is a synonym but still a statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, possibly using synonyms. But the second input's output is a structural change from first-person to third-person. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve various transformations like changing subject, using more formal language, or rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs often start with \"Would you be able to...\" or \"It is my opinion...\", maybe the instruction was to turn questions into statements or use more formal expressions. But the first input is a question, and the output is a statement. The fifth input is a question, and the output is a statement. The second input is a statement, and the output is a statement. The fourth input is a greeting, and the output is a statement. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, which could involve changing the subject, using more formal language, or rephrasing.\n\nBut the third input's output is a synonym, not a statement. So maybe the instruction was broader: to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could include various transformations. For example, changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\" (formal), changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" (more formal), changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\" (more formal), changing \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\" (more formal), and changing \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\" (more formal).\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely was something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language and structure.\" Alternatively, it could be more specific, such as \"Convert each question into a statement using more formal phrasing,\" but that doesn't account for all the examples. Another possibility is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could involve various methods like synonym substitution, changing sentence structure, or using more formal language.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, some are more about changing the subject (e.g., \"It is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\"), others are about changing the verb form (e.g., \"be able to\" instead of \"can\"), and others are about rephrasing greetings. So the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve any combination of these techniques.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, the second input's output starts with \"It is my opinion\", which is a common way to express a personal belief in a more formal tone. The fifth input's output is a question turned into a statement using \"Shall I...\", which is a polite way to offer help. The first input's output uses \"Would you be able to\", which is a more formal way of asking if someone can do something. The fourth input's output is a greeting transformed into a statement of anticipation. The third input's output is a synonym substitution with more formal terms.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language and structure.\" This would encompass all the transformations observed. Alternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like \"Convert each question into a statement using more formal phrasing,\" but that doesn't explain the other examples. For instance, the second input is a statement, and the output is also a statement but more formal. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. The<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>",
