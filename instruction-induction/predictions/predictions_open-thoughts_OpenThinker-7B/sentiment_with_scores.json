The user provided five input-output pairs where each input is a sentence or phrase, and the output is either \"positive\" or \"negative\". My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would lead someone to assign these outputs based on the inputs.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the relationship between each input and its corresponding output. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Input 1: \"The film is small in scope, yet perfectly formed.\" Output: positive.**\n   - The key here is the contrast between \"small in scope\" and \"perfectly formed\". Even though the scope is small, the execution is excellent. So maybe the instruction is looking for phrases that highlight quality despite limitations, leading to a positive assessment.\n\n2. **Input 2: \"The title, alone, should scare any sane person away.\" Output: negative.**\n   - The title is so bad that it scares people away. So the instruction might be looking for language that indicates a strong negative reaction, possibly due to something alarming or off-putting.\n\n3. **Input 3: \"Video games are more involving than this mess.\" Output: negative.**\n   - Comparing video games favorably to \"this mess\" implies that the subject (whatever \"this mess\" refers to) is poor quality. So the instruction might detect comparisons where the subject is unfavorably compared to something else, leading to a negative output.\n\n4. **Input 4: \"Assured, glossy and shot through with brittle desperation.\" Output: positive.**\n   - The words \"assured\" and \"glossy\" are positive, but \"brittle desperation\" seems negative. However, the overall output is positive. Maybe the instruction considers the dominant tone or the balance of positive vs. negative elements. Here, \"assured\" and \"glossy\" might outweigh the negative part, leading to a positive assessment.\n\n5. **Input 5: \"Gets better after Foster leaves that little room.\" Output: positive.**\n   - The phrase suggests that the quality improves when a certain element (Foster leaving a room) happens. So the instruction might look for indications of improvement or resolution of issues, leading to a positive outcome.\n\nNow, putting these together, what common thread connects all these inputs? Let's think about possible instruction types:\n\n- **Sentiment Analysis:** But the outputs don't strictly follow positive/negative word counts. For example, Input 4 has both positive and negative words but is still positive. So maybe it's not just about individual words but the overall tone or context.\n\n- **Critical Evaluation:** The inputs seem to be critical reviews. The outputs indicate whether the review is positive or negative. Let's check if that fits.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n- Input 1: Despite being small in scope, the film is well-made → Positive.\n- Input 2: Title is so bad it scares people → Negative.\n- Input 3: Compared to video games, this is worse → Negative.\n- Input 4: Assured and glossy, even with desperation → Positive.\n- Input 5: Improves when Foster leaves → Positive.\n\nSo the instruction might be to determine if a review is positive or negative based on the overall critical perspective. But how?\n\nAnother angle: The outputs could be based on specific keywords or phrases that signal a positive or negative judgment. For example, \"scare...away\" (Input 2) is a strong negative indicator. \"Perfectly formed\" (Input 1) is a clear positive. \"More involving than this mess\" (Input 3) uses \"mess\" as a negative term, implying the subject is worse. \"Shot through with brittle desperation\" (Input 4) might be a mixed phrase, but the overall tone is positive. \"Gets better\" (Input 5) suggests improvement, which is positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to identify if the text contains a recommendation or endorsement. For example, if the text implies that the subject is worth watching/reading, it's positive; otherwise, negative. But Input 3 says \"more involving than this mess,\" which doesn't explicitly recommend it but compares unfavorably to video games, which might be seen as a negative.\n\nWait, but in Input 3, the output is negative. The input says \"Video games are more involving than this mess.\" So the \"mess\" is the subject, and the comparison is unfavorable. So the instruction might be to detect when the subject is unfavorably compared to something else, leading to a negative output.\n\nSimilarly, Input 2's title scaring people away is a negative reaction, hence negative output.\n\nInput 1's contrast between small scope and perfect formation leads to a positive because the execution is good despite limitations.\n\nInput 4's \"assured, glossy\" are positives, even with the negative part, so maybe the instruction looks for the presence of certain positive adjectives or phrases.\n\nInput 5's improvement after a change is positive.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to classify the text as positive or negative based on the following criteria:\n\n- If the text contains phrases indicating a strong negative reaction (like \"should scare any sane person away\"), output negative.\n\n- If the text highlights the quality despite limitations (\"small in scope, yet perfectly formed\") → positive.\n\n- If the text unfavorably compares the subject to something else (e.g., \"this mess\" vs. video games), output negative.\n\n- If the text uses positive adjectives like \"assured,\" \"glossy,\" even if there's a negative element, output positive.\n\n- If the text mentions improvement (\"gets better after...\"), output positive.\n\nBut how to formalize this into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to determine if the review is positive or negative by evaluating the overall sentiment, considering factors like critical praise, unfavorable comparisons, recommendations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to identify if the text expresses a positive or negative opinion based on specific keywords or phrases. For example:\n\n- Look for phrases like \"perfectly formed,\" \"assured,\" \"glossy,\" \"gets better,\" which signal positivity.\n\n- Look for phrases like \"scare...away,\" \"mess,\" \"desperation,\" which signal negativity.\n\nBut the problem is that some phrases can be ambiguous. For instance, \"shot through with brittle desperation\" might be a metaphor, but in context, it's part of a critical review. Similarly, \"small in scope\" could be neutral, but combined with \"perfectly formed,\" it becomes positive.\n\nAnother approach: The instruction might involve checking for the presence of certain positive or negative indicators. For example:\n\n- If the text contains \"perfectly formed,\" \"assured,\" \"glossy,\" \"improves,\" \"better,\" then positive.\n\n- If the text contains \"scare,\" \"mess,\" \"desperation,\" \"sane person away,\" then negative.\n\nBut how to structure this into a coherent instruction?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to evaluate the text for critical reception, considering factors like the reviewer's opinion, the use of superlatives, comparisons, and the overall tone.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples:\n\nInput 1: The film is small in scope, yet perfectly formed. Output: positive. The key here is the contrast between \"small\" and \"perfectly formed,\" suggesting that despite its limitations, it's well-executed. So maybe the instruction is to look for phrases that highlight quality despite constraints, leading to a positive assessment.\n\nInput 2: Title alone scares people away. Output: negative. The title is so bad it's alarming, leading to a negative review.\n\nInput 3: Video games are more involving than this mess. Output: negative. The \"mess\" is the subject, and the comparison is unfavorable, so the review is negative.\n\nInput 4: Assured, glossy and shot through with brittle desperation. Output: positive. The positive adjectives (\"assured,\" \"glossy\") outweigh the negative part, leading to a positive.\n\nInput 5: Gets better after Foster leaves that little room. Output: positive. Improvement is seen as a positive aspect.\n\nSo the instruction might involve several criteria:\n\n1. Check for phrases indicating strong negative reactions (e.g., \"scare any sane person away,\" \"mess,\" \"desperation\").\n\n2. Check for contrasts where the subject is praised despite limitations (e.g., \"small in scope, yet perfectly formed\").\n\n3. Check for unfavorable comparisons (e.g., \"more involving than this mess\").\n\n4. Check for positive adjectives or phrases (e.g., \"assured,\" \"glossy\").\n\n5. Check for indications of improvement (e.g., \"gets better\").\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction is to determine if the text is a positive or negative review based on the following:\n\n- If the text contains phrases that express a strong negative opinion (e.g., \"scare,\" \"mess,\" \"desperation\"), output negative.\n\n- If the text uses a contrast where the subject is praised despite its limitations (e.g., \"small in scope, yet perfectly formed\"), output positive.\n\n- If the text unfavorably compares the subject to something else (e.g., \"more involving than this mess\"), output negative.\n\n- If the text contains positive adjectives or phrases (e.g., \"assured,\" \"glossy\"), output positive.\n\n- If the text indicates improvement (e.g., \"gets better\"), output positive.\n\nBut this seems a bit fragmented. Alternatively, the instruction could be more general, like \"classify the given text as positive or negative based on the overall critical reception.\"\n\nHowever, the user's instruction might be more specific. Let's think about possible instructions that could generate these outputs.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs could<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input is a phrase or sentence, and the output is either \"positive\" or \"negative\". My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would lead someone to assign these outputs based on the inputs.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the relationship between each input and its corresponding output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: Brisk hack job. Output: negative\n2. Input: Highly engaging. Output: positive\n3. Input: One funny popcorn flick. Output: positive\n4. Input: Intriguing and stylish. Output: positive\n5. Input: Another boorish movie... Output: negative\n\nLooking at these, the key seems to be identifying words or phrases that signal a positive or negative sentiment. Let's break down each input:\n\n1. \"Brisk hack job.\" – The word \"hack\" here might be slang. In some contexts, \"hack job\" can mean something done quickly or poorly, which is negative. So \"brisk\" might contrast with \"hack job\", but the overall output is negative. Maybe the instruction is looking for negative connotations in certain phrases.\n\n2. \"Highly engaging.\" – Directly positive. The instruction might look for positive adjectives like \"engaging\".\n\n3. \"One funny popcorn flick.\" – \"Funny\" and \"popcorn flick\" (a term often used for light, entertaining movies) are positive. So the instruction might associate these terms with positive reviews.\n\n4. \"Intriguing and stylish.\" – Both \"intriguing\" and \"stylish\" are positive descriptors. The instruction might look for multiple positive adjectives.\n\n5. \"Another boorish movie...\" – \"Boorish\" is clearly negative. The phrase \"from the I-heard-a-joke-at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting\" adds more negativity, implying low quality humor typical of such settings. So the instruction might detect negative terms like \"boorish\" or phrases indicating poor taste.\n\nNow, putting this together, the instruction likely involves evaluating the inputs for the presence of certain keywords or phrases that indicate a positive or negative review. Let's hypothesize possible instructions:\n\nPossible instruction types:\n- Check for specific positive/negative keywords.\n- Look for the presence of certain adjectives (e.g., \"engaging\", \"funny\", \"intriguing\" as positive; \"hack job\", \"boorish\" as negative).\n- Assess the overall tone based on common phrases used in reviews.\n\nLet me test possible instructions against the examples.\n\nOption 1: \"Classify the input as positive or negative based on the presence of specific keywords.\"\n\nFor example, if the instruction says to check for words like \"engaging\", \"funny\", \"intriguing\" (positive) vs. \"hack job\", \"boorish\" (negative), then the outputs make sense. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: \"Brisk hack job.\" Contains \"hack job\" → negative.\nInput 2: \"Highly engaging.\" Contains \"engaging\" → positive.\nInput 3: \"Funny popcorn flick.\" Contains \"funny\" → positive.\nInput 4: \"Intriguing and stylish.\" Both positive adjectives → positive.\nInput 5: \"Boorish movie...\" contains \"boorish\" → negative.\n\nThis fits all examples. So the instruction might be something like: \"Identify if the text contains any of the following negative phrases: 'hack job', 'boorish', 'frat party' and classify as negative. Otherwise, check for positive phrases like 'engaging', 'funny', 'intriguing' and classify as positive.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth input mentions \"I-heard-a-joke-at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting,\" which includes \"frat party,\" so maybe the instruction checks for \"frat party\" as part of the negative phrase. Similarly, \"hack job\" is a standalone negative term.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more general, like \"Determine the sentiment of the input by looking for positive or negative keywords.\" But without more context, the specific keywords are necessary.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs are positive when the input has certain positive adjectives, and negative when it contains negative adjectives or phrases. So the instruction might be: \"Assign 'positive' if the input contains any of the following adjectives: engaging, funny, intriguing, stylish. Assign 'negative' if it contains any of the following: hack job, boorish, frat party.\"\n\nTesting this:\n\nInput 1: \"Brisk hack job.\" Has \"hack job\" → negative. Correct.\nInput 2: \"Highly engaging.\" Has \"engaging\" → positive. Correct.\nInput 3: \"Funny popcorn flick.\" Has \"funny\" → positive. Correct.\nInput 4: \"Intriguing and stylish.\" Both positive → positive. Correct.\nInput 5: \"Boorish movie...\" has \"boorish\" → negative. Correct.\n\nThis works. So the instruction is likely to check for the presence of specific positive or negative keywords/phrases and classify accordingly.\n\nBut why does the first input have \"brisk\"? \"Brisk\" alone isn't listed. Maybe \"brisk\" is part of a phrase? Wait, the input is \"Brisk hack job.\" So \"brisk\" is modifying \"hack job.\" If \"hack job\" is negative, then even though \"brisk\" is positive, the overall phrase is negative because of \"hack job.\" So the instruction might prioritize checking for negative keywords over positive ones. For example, if any negative keyword is present, classify as negative, otherwise check for positive keywords.\n\nThat makes sense. So the instruction could be: \"If the input contains any of the following negative phrases: 'hack job', 'boorish', 'frat party', classify as negative. Otherwise, if it contains any of the following positive phrases: 'engaging', 'funny', 'intriguing', 'stylish', classify as positive. If neither, default to neutral, but in the given examples, there are no neutrals.\"\n\nLooking at the examples, all inputs except the first one don't have both positive and negative keywords. The first input has \"hack job\" which overrides the positive \"brisk.\" So the instruction prioritizes negative keywords over positive ones.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is likely: \"Classify the input as 'negative' if it contains any of the following terms: 'hack job', 'boorish', 'frat party'. Otherwise, classify as 'positive' if it contains any of the following terms: 'engaging', 'funny', 'intriguing', 'stylish'. If none of these terms are present, leave as neutral, but in the given examples, all inputs contain at least one of these terms.\"\n\nWait, but the first input has \"Brisk hack job.\" It contains \"hack job\" which is negative, so classified as negative. The second input has \"Highly engaging.\" Contains \"engaging\" → positive. Third: \"funny\" → positive. Fourth: \"intriguing and stylish\" → positive. Fifth: \"boorish\" → negative. So yes, the instruction would check for the presence of any negative terms first. If found, negative. Else, check for positive terms. If found, positive. Else, neutral. But in the examples, all inputs have at least one of the required terms, so the classification is straightforward.\n\nThus, the instruction is probably: \"Determine the sentiment by checking for the presence of specific keywords. If the input contains any of the following negative terms: 'hack job', 'boorish', 'frat party', classify as negative. Otherwise, if it contains any of the following positive terms: 'engaging', 'funny', 'intriguing', 'stylish', classify as positive. If neither, classify as neutral. However, in the given examples, all inputs contain at least one of the required terms.\"\n\nBut since the user's friend followed this instruction and got the outputs right, the instruction must be exactly that. Therefore, the answer is that the instruction was to check for the presence of specific negative or positive keywords and classify accordingly.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **classify the input as \"negative\" if it contains any of the following terms: \"hack job,\" \"boorish,\" or \"frat party.\" Otherwise, classify it as \"positive\" if it contains any of the terms: \"engaging,\" \"funny,\" \"intriguing,\" or \"stylish.\"** \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Negative Keywords**:  \n   - \"Hack job\" and \"boorish\" directly indicate low quality or poor execution.  \n   - \"Frat party\" implies crass humor typical of unrefined entertainment.  \n\n2. **Positive Keywords**:  \n   - \"Engaging,\" \"funny,\" \"intriguing,\" and \"stylish\" reflect favorable attributes like entertainment value or aesthetic appeal.  \n\n3. **Rule Application**:  \n   - If an input contains *any* negative keyword (e.g., \"hack job\"), it is labeled **negative** regardless of other adjectives.  \n   - If no negative keywords are present, the presence of *any* positive keyword results in a **positive** classification.  \n\n### Example Breakdown:\n- **Input: \"Brisk hack job.\"** → Contains \"hack job\" → **Negative**.  \n- **Input: \"Highly engaging.\"** → Contains \"engaging\" → **Positive**.  \n- **Input: \"One funny popcorn",

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each input is a sentence or phrase, and the output is either \"positive\" or \"negative\". My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would lead someone to assign those outputs.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned.\" → Output: negative\n2. Input: \"Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful, subjective filmmaking.\" → positive\n3. Input: \"This isn't a movie; it's a symptom.\" → negative\n4. Input: \"A three-hour cinema master class.\" → positive\n5. Input: \"This thing is just garbage.\" → negative\n\nLooking at the first input, the phrase starts with \"Lame Sweet Home\". Wait, maybe that's a reference to a movie title? \"Sweet Home Alabama\" comes to mind, which is a film about stereotypical Southern characters. The output is negative, so perhaps the instruction is to evaluate the sentiment of the text. But the second input is clearly positive, so maybe the instruction is more nuanced than just basic sentiment analysis.\n\nThe third input is a critical statement calling the movie a \"symptom\", which is negative. The fourth is a positive review, saying it's a master class. The fifth is explicitly negative. So maybe the instruction is to determine if the text is a positive or negative review of a movie, but there's something more here.\n\nWait, looking at the first input: \"Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned.\" The mention of \"Southern stereotype\" might be a clue. Maybe the instruction is to check if the text contains any references to stereotyping in Southern contexts, and if so, whether it's a negative or positive take on that. But the output is negative regardless. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to detect if the text is a negative review of a movie, but the first input is a movie title (Sweet Home Alabama) and the output is negative. However, the second input is a positive review of a different movie (\"three-hour cinema master class\"), which is positive. The third input is a negative review (\"symptom\"), fourth is positive, fifth is negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to classify the text based on whether it's a movie review and its sentiment. But why does the first input get negative even though it's a movie title? Unless the instruction is to check if the text is a movie review and then assess its sentiment. But the first input is a movie title, not a review. That doesn't fit. So maybe the instruction is to determine if the text is a movie review, and if so, its sentiment. But the first input isn't a review, so perhaps the instruction is to check if the text is a movie-related statement and then evaluate its sentiment. But the first input is a movie title, which might be part of a review. For example, \"Lame Sweet Home\" could be a review of the movie \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\n\nBut how do we reconcile that? Let's think again. The first input is a sentence that includes the movie title, and the output is negative. The second input is a sentence that praises the film as a master class, output positive. Third is a negative review, fourth positive, fifth negative. So maybe the instruction is to determine if the text is a movie review and then classify its sentiment. But the first input is a movie title, not a review. Unless the instruction is to check if the text is a movie title and then classify it as positive or negative. But that seems unlikely because \"Lame Sweet Home\" is a title, not a review. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to check if the text is a movie review and then determine if it's positive or negative. But the first input isn't a review. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to evaluate the overall tone of the text, regardless of context. For example, the first input has words like \"lame\" and \"stereotype unturned\", which are negative. The second uses \"powerful\", \"thoughtful\", \"subjective\" which are positive. The third is a harsh criticism, fourth a positive assessment, fifth is \"garbage\". So maybe the instruction is simply to perform sentiment analysis, where certain keywords or phrases trigger a positive or negative classification. But why does the first input get negative? Because it contains negative words. The second has positive words. The third is a negative review. Fourth is positive. Fifth is negative. So maybe the instruction is to classify the text as positive or negative based on the presence of certain keywords or phrases. But how does that work with the first input? It's a movie title, but the output is negative. Unless the instruction is to check if the text is a movie review and then apply sentiment analysis. But the first input isn't a review. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to determine if the text is a movie review and then classify its sentiment. But the first input is a movie title, not a review. Unless the instruction is to check if the text is a movie-related statement and then classify its sentiment. For example, \"Lame Sweet Home\" could be part of a review.

So this line of thinking might not be correct.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they are all either positive or negative. The inputs vary in content but the outputs are consistent. So perhaps the instruction is to classify the input as positive or negative based on some criteria. Let's see:\n\n- The first input has \"lame\" and \"stereotype unturned\", which are negative. Output is negative.\n- Second input has \"powerful\", \"thoughtful\", \"master class\" – positive.\n- Third input is a harsh critique, output negative.\n- Fourth is a positive review.\n- Fifth is \"garbage\", output negative.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to check for the presence of certain keywords or phrases that indicate a positive or negative sentiment.

Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to check if the text is a movie review and then apply sentiment analysis. But the first input isn't a review. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction is to determine if the text is a movie review and then classify its sentiment. But the first input is a movie title, not a review.

Therefore, this can't be the case.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for common words or phrases across the inputs. The first input mentions \"Southern stereotype\", which might be a key term. The output is negative. The second input has \"powerful\", \"thoughtful\", \"master class\" – positive. The third is a negative review. The fourth is positive. The fifth is negative. So maybe the instruction is to check for the presence of certain keywords or phrases that indicate a positive or negative sentiment.

Unless the instruction is to check if the text is a movie-related statement and then classify its sentiment. For example, \"Lame Sweet Home\" could be part of a review. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to check if the text is a movie review and then determine if it's positive or negative.

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each input is a sentence or phrase, and the output is either \"positive\" or \"negative\". My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would lead someone to assign those outputs.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel.\" → Output: negative\n2. Input: \"...no charm, no laughs, no fun, no reason to watch.\" → negative\n3. Input: \"The script is smart, not cloying.\" → positive\n4. Input: \"Sexy and romantic.\" → positive\n5. Input: \"Doesn't really add up to much.\" → negative\n\nLooking at the first two inputs, they both start with a negative connotation. The first mentions Disney making a sequel quickly (quick-buck), which might imply it's not original or of poor quality. The second input lists several negatives: no charm, no laughs, etc., leading to a negative review. The third and fourth inputs are more positive, highlighting smart scripts and romantic elements. The fifth input is vague but still negative.\n\nSo, the instruction likely involves evaluating the sentiment of the input text. But how exactly? Maybe the instruction is to determine if the text is a movie review, and then classify it as positive or negative based on certain keywords or phrases. Alternatively, perhaps it's about identifying specific aspects like plot, characters, or themes.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the first four inputs seem to be movie reviews. The fifth one is also a general statement. So maybe the instruction is to analyze the input text and determine if it's a positive or negative review. But why does the fifth input get a negative output? Because \"doesn't really add up to much\" is a negative phrase. So the instruction might be to check for any negative keywords or phrases regardless of context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to evaluate the overall tone of the input. For example, if the input contains words like \"charm,\" \"fun,\" \"romantic,\" it's positive; if it has \"no,\" \"doesn't,\" \"quick-buck,\" it's negative. But that seems too simplistic. Let's check the inputs again.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction is to identify if the input is a positive or negative review of a product, service, or event. The examples given include movie reviews (Disney sequel, script smart, sexy and romantic) and a general statement about not adding up. So maybe the instruction is to determine if the input is a positive or negative review, considering common positive/negative indicators.\n\nBut how do the instructions typically work? Often, instructions involve tasks like \"classify the following text as positive or negative based on [certain criteria].\" So maybe the original instruction was something like \"Classify the given text as positive or negative based on the presence of positive or negative keywords.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to count the number of positive or negative words and decide based on that. For example, if there are more positive words than negative, output positive; otherwise, negative. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel.\" Negative words: ransacks (implying exploiting archives), quick-buck (cheap). Positive words: none. So output negative.\n\nSecond input: \"...no charm, no laughs, no fun, no reason to watch.\" All negative. Output negative.\n\nThird input: \"The script is smart, not cloying.\" Positive words: smart, not cloying. Output positive.\n\nFourth input: \"Sexy and romantic.\" Both positive. Output positive.\n\nFifth input: \"Doesn't really add up to much.\" Negative phrase: doesn't add up. Output negative.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the instruction might have been to count the number of positive vs. negative words and classify accordingly. But how exactly? If the count of negative words exceeds positive, output negative. Otherwise, positive. Or maybe if any negative word is present, output negative. But in the first example, there are no positive words, so output negative. Similarly, the second example has all negatives. Third and fourth have positives. Fifth has a negative phrase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to check for the presence of any negative keywords. If any negative keyword is present, output negative. Otherwise, positive. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nNegative keywords could be words like \"no,\" \"doesn't,\" \"not,\" \"cheap,\" \"boring,\" etc. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"ransacks,\" \"quick-buck\" → negative. So output negative.\n\nSecond input: multiple \"no\" → negative.\n\nThird input: no negatives → positive.\n\nFourth input: no negatives → positive.\n\nFifth input: \"doesn't\" → negative.\n\nThis matches the outputs. So the instruction might have been to check if the input contains any negative keywords (like \"no,\" \"doesn't,\" \"not,\" \"cheap,\" \"boring,\" etc.), and if so, output negative; otherwise, positive. That seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, the first input doesn't have \"no\" or \"doesn't,\" but still outputs negative. So maybe the instruction is broader. Perhaps the instruction was to evaluate the overall sentiment based on the presence of positive or negative language, regardless of specific keywords. For example, if the text expresses a negative opinion, output negative. If it expresses a positive opinion, output positive. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to check for the presence of any negative adjectives or adverbs. Let's see:\n\nFirst input: \"ransacks\" (verb, negative), \"quick-buck\" (negative). So negative.\n\nSecond input: multiple \"no\" + adjectives/nouns (charm, laughs, fun, reason) all negative. So negative.\n\nThird input: \"smart\" (positive), \"not cloying\" (positive). So positive.\n\nFourth input: \"sexy\" and \"romantic\" (both positive). So positive.\n\nFifth input: \"doesn't add up\" (negative). So negative.\n\nThis also fits. So the instruction might have been to check for the presence of any negative adjectives, adverbs, or verbs. If any are found, output negative; otherwise, positive. But how to formalize this into an instruction?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to determine if the input is a positive or negative review of a product or service, using common positive or negative indicators. For example, if the input mentions \"charm,\" \"fun,\" \"romantic,\" it's positive; if it mentions \"no,\" \"cheap,\" \"boring,\" it's negative.\n\nBut the problem is that the instruction needs to be precise. The user probably gave a clear instruction, possibly in natural language, like \"Classify the text as positive or negative based on the presence of positive or negative keywords,\" or \"Determine if the text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.\"\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the instruction, we have to reverse-engineer it from the examples. The key here is that the outputs are determined by whether the input contains any negative elements. So the instruction likely involved checking for the presence of negative words or phrases and classifying accordingly.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to count the number of positive and negative words. If the ratio of positive to negative is greater than 1, output positive; else, negative. But in the first example, there are zero positive words, so ratio is 0/2 = 0 < 1 → negative. Second example: 0/4 = 0 → negative. Third: 2/0 = infinity → positive. Fourth: 2/0 = positive. Fifth: 0/1 = 0 → negative. This also works. So the instruction could have been to calculate the ratio of positive to negative words and classify accordingly.\n\nBut how to determine which words are positive or negative? The user might have had a predefined list. However, without knowing the exact instruction, it's challenging. But given the examples, the most straightforward pattern is that any input containing negative words or phrases results in a negative output, while those without result in positive. Therefore, the instruction was likely something like \"Classify the text as positive or negative based on the presence of negative keywords,\" where negative keywords are defined as words like \"no,\" \"doesn't,\" \"cheap,\" \"boring,\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more general, like \"Analyze the text to determine if it expresses a positive or negative sentiment,\" with the understanding that the user's friend would look for common positive or negative indicators.\n\nBut given the examples, the most precise instruction would be to check for the presence of any negative words or phrases and classify accordingly. Since the outputs are negative when there are negative elements and positive otherwise, the instruction must have been to detect the presence of negative indicators.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was probably something like:\n\n\"Classify the given text as 'positive' or 'negative' based on the presence of negative keywords. If any negative keyword is present, output 'negative'; otherwise, output 'positive'.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the instruction was to count the number of positive vs. negative words and classify based on that, but without knowing the exact list of positive/negative words, it's hard to say. However, given the examples, the simplest explanation is that the instruction required detecting the presence of negative elements.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe original instruction was likely to **classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\" based on the presence",

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input is a sentence about a film, and the output is either \"positive\" or \"negative\". My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would lead someone to assign these outputs based on the inputs.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"...unlikable, uninteresting, unfunny, and completely, utterly inept.\" → Output: negative\n2. Input: \"Fast-paced and wonderfully edited, the film is extremely thorough.\" → Output: positive\n3. Input: \"the film never rises above a conventional, two dimension tale\" → Output: negative\n4. Input: \"A terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown.\" → Output: positive\n5. Input: \"...a solid, unassuming drama.\" → Output: positive\n\nLooking at these, the key seems to be identifying whether the overall sentiment of the input is positive or negative. But how exactly? Let's break down each input.\n\nStarting with the first input: It lists multiple negative adjectives—unlikable, uninteresting, unfunny, inept. All of these are clearly negative descriptors. So the output is negative, which matches. The second input has positive words like fast-paced, wonderful, thorough. So output is positive. Third input uses \"never rises above,\" \"conventional,\" \"two dimension\"—these are critical terms suggesting the film lacks depth or quality. Hence negative. Fourth input has \"terrific,\" which is very positive, so output positive. Fifth input: \"solid, unassuming drama\" – \"solid\" can be neutral but in context here, maybe implying it's reliable or meets expectations without being flashy, which might be seen as positive. So output positive.\n\nSo the instruction likely asks the friend to determine the overall sentiment of the input text. But perhaps there's more nuance. Let me check if any of the inputs have mixed elements. For example, the third input says \"never rises above a conventional, two dimension tale.\" The \"never\" and \"conventional\" are negative, but \"two dimension\" might be a criticism of flatness. So overall negative. The fourth input is straightforwardly positive. The fifth input: \"solid, unassuming drama.\" \"Solid\" can sometimes be used neutrally, but in movie reviews, \"solid\" often means it's competently made without being exceptional, which might still be considered positive. So the output is positive.\n\nNow, considering possible instructions. Common instructions for sentiment analysis might ask to classify the text as positive or negative based on the overall tone. But maybe the instruction was more specific. For example, looking for certain keywords or phrases. Let's see:\n\nIn the first input, all the adjectives are negative. The second has positive ones. The third has negative phrases. The fourth has a strong positive term. The fifth has \"solid\" which is neutral but in context here, maybe positive. So perhaps the instruction was to look for any positive or negative words and determine the overall sentiment. But sometimes even a single positive word can outweigh negatives, but in these examples, the outputs seem to align with the majority of positive/negative words.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to check for the presence of certain keywords. For example, if the input contains words like \"terrific,\" \"wonderfully,\" \"thorough,\" etc., then output positive; otherwise, if it has words like \"unlikable,\" \"inept,\" \"never rises above,\" then negative. But let's check:\n\nInput 1: All negative words → negative.\nInput 2: Positive words → positive.\nInput 3: Negative phrases → negative.\nInput 4: Positive phrase → positive.\nInput 5: \"solid\" (neutral) but context makes it positive → positive.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to look for any positive or negative words and classify accordingly. However, sometimes even a single positive word can make the entire review positive. But in these cases, the outputs seem to match the majority of the sentiment in the input. For example, input 5 has \"solid\" which is neutral, but the rest of the description (\"unassuming drama\") might lean slightly positive. So perhaps the instruction was to consider the overall tone, not just individual words.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to check for the presence of certain key phrases. For instance, \"terrific insider look\" in input 4 is a clear positive indicator. Similarly, \"never rises above\" in input 3 is a strong negative phrase. Inputs 1 and 5 are more about listing qualities rather than having a single key phrase.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to evaluate the emotional valence of the entire sentence. For example, using a lexicon-based approach where each word is assigned a sentiment score and summed up. If the total is positive, output positive; else negative. But in this case, the inputs vary. For example, input 1 has four negative words, which would sum to a negative score. Input 2 has several positive words, summing to positive. Input 5 has \"solid\" (neutral) but maybe in the context of a drama, \"solid\" is positive. So maybe the instruction was to use such a lexicon.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's friend read the instruction and wrote outputs for each input. So the instruction must be something that, when applied to each input, leads to the given outputs. Let's think of possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Classify the sentiment of the text as positive or negative.\"\n   - This is too vague. The friend would need more specifics.\n\n2. \"Determine if the review is positive or negative based on the overall tone.\"\n   - Again, too general. But maybe combined with looking for specific keywords.\n\n3. \"Identify the primary emotion expressed in the text (positive or negative).\"\n   - Similar issue.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more specific, like checking for the presence of certain keywords. For example:\n\n- If the input contains words like \"terrific,\" \"amazing,\" \"excellent,\" \"loved,\" \"best,\" output positive.\n- If the input contains words like \"terrible,\" \"awful,\" \"hated,\" \"worst,\" output negative.\n- Otherwise, check for other indicators.\n\nBut in the given examples, input 4 has \"terrific,\" which fits. Input 1 has no such positive words. Input 3 has \"never rises above,\" which is negative. Input 5 has \"solid,\" which might not be in the list. So maybe the instruction was a combination of checking for positive and negative keywords, and if none are found, default to neutral, but since the outputs are only positive or negative, perhaps the instruction required that even a single positive or negative keyword determines the output.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to look for the presence of any positive or negative adjectives. For example, if there's at least one positive adjective, output positive; if at least one negative, output negative; else neutral. But in input 5, \"solid\" is neutral, but the rest of the sentence (\"unassuming drama\") might lean positive. However, the output is positive. So maybe the instruction was to consider the overall sentiment, not just individual words.\n\nWait, but how do we reconcile input 5? The output is positive, but the input doesn't have any overtly positive words. So perhaps the instruction was to look for phrases that indicate a positive or negative opinion, even if they're not explicitly positive or negative adjectives. For example, \"terrific insider look\" in input 4 is a clear positive phrase. \"Never rises above\" in input 3 is a clear negative phrase. Inputs 1 and 5 are lists of traits, some positive, some negative. But in input 1, all are negative, so output negative. In input 5, \"solid, unassuming drama\" – \"solid\" could be neutral, but maybe in the context of a drama, \"solid\" implies it's a good, reliable film, hence positive. So perhaps the instruction was to evaluate the overall impression, considering the balance of positive and negative elements.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to check for the presence of any positive or negative words, and if there are both, to look for which type dominates. But in input 5, there are no overtly positive words except \"solid,\" which might be considered neutral. However, the output is positive. So maybe the instruction was to consider the context. For example, \"solid\" in a film review might be positive because it means the film is well-made without being overly ambitious. Similarly, \"unassuming\" might be seen as a positive trait in a drama. So the instruction might have been to look for words that, in the context of a film review, indicate a positive or negative opinion.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction was more nuanced, requiring the friend to parse the text and determine the overall sentiment based on the words used, possibly considering common collocations or phrases associated with positive or negative reviews. For example, \"terrific insider look\" is a strong positive, while \"never rises above\" is a strong negative. Inputs 1 and 5 have mixed elements but lean towards negative and positive respectively.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is: \"Classify the sentiment of the text as positive or negative based on the overall tone and key phrases.\" This would require the friend to read each input carefully, considering the words and their implications in the context of a film review, and determine the overall sentiment accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been simpler: \"Determine if the review is positive or negative by looking for<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>",
