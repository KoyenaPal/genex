So, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to find the rule that connects each pair. Let me start by listing them out again to get a clear view.\n\nInputs:\n1. 29 29 → Output 58\n2. 20 68 → Output 88\n3. 43 51 → Output 94\n4. 37 49 → Output 86\n5. 5 8 → Output 13\n\nHmm, looking at these pairs, maybe there's a pattern involving addition or some other operation. Let's check each one step by step.\n\nFirst pair: 29 and 29. If I add them, 29+29=58. Oh, wait! That's exactly the output. So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers. But let's check the others to confirm.\n\nSecond input: 20 + 68 = 88. Yep, that matches the output. Third: 43 +51=94. Correct. Fourth: 37+49=86. Right. Fifth: 5+8=13. Perfect. So all outputs are just the sum of the two inputs. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me double-check each case.\n\nWait, but why would the user present this as a problem if it's just addition? Maybe there's a different operation involved. Let me think again. Sometimes, problems might involve concatenation or other operations. For example, adding digits or something else. Let's test that.\n\nTake the first input: 29 and 29. If we concatenate them, it's 2929, which isn't 58. If we add digits: 2+9=11 and 2+9=11, total 22. Not 58. Hmm. What about multiplying? 29*29=841, which is way bigger. 20*68=1360, not 88. So multiplication doesn't fit. How about subtraction? 29-29=0, nope. 20-68=-48, not 88. So subtraction is out.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the sum of the digits of each number. For example, 29 has digits 2 and 9 (sum 11), 29 again sum 11. Total sum 22. Not 58. Doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers' digits. Wait, 29's digits sum to 11, 29's digits sum to 11. 11+11=22. Still not 58. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers plus something else. Let's see. For the first input, 29+29=58. So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers. But why would the user ask for this? It seems too simple. Maybe there's a different approach here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are being added in a different base? For example, if the inputs are in base 10, but the output is in another base. Let's check. For example, 29 in base 10 is 29, 29 in base 10 is 29. Sum is 58. If the output is in base 10, that works. But maybe the inputs are in a different base. Let's test that.\n\nSuppose the first input is 29 in base X and 29 in base Y. Let's see. For example, if the first input is 29 in base 10 and 29 in base 10, sum is 58. If the first input is 29 in base 10 and 29 in base 10, same as before. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are in a different base. Let's take the first input: 29 in base 10 is 29, 29 in base 10 is 29. Sum is 58. If the output is in base 10, that works. So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers. But why would the user present this as a problem? It's possible, but maybe there's a more complex pattern.\n\nWait, let's check the fifth input: 5 and 8. Their sum is 13. That's correct. So all the examples fit addition. But maybe the user is testing if I can recognize that. However, sometimes problems like this might involve a different operation when you look closer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the numbers are being added, but with some digits reversed. For example, 29 reversed is 92, but adding 92+29=121, which isn't 58. Not helpful. Or maybe the digits are concatenated and then summed. Like 29 and 29 become 2929, which is 2929. Not 58. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers multiplied by something. For example, 29+29=58. If we multiply by 1, it's still 58. But that's trivial. Alternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers plus the product. Let's see: 29+29=58, 29*29=841. 58+841=900. Not matching any outputs. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being added, but each digit is processed separately. For example, 29 is 2 and 9. 29 is 2 and 9. Adding the digits: 2+9=11 and 2+9=11. Then sum those totals: 11+11=22. Not 58. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers, but each number is treated as a single digit. For example, 29 is considered as 2 and 9, but that's not a single digit. So that's not applicable.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the numbers are being added, but the result is written in a different base. For example, if the output is in base 10, but the sum is calculated in another base. Let's test that. For example, if the first input is 29 in base 10 and 29 in base 10, sum is 58 in base 10. So that's the same as before. If the sum is in base 10, that's the same as adding in base 10. So that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are in a different base. Let's suppose the first input is 29 in base X and 29 in base Y. Let's see. For example, if the first input is 29 in base 10 and 29 in base 10, sum is 58. If the first input is 29 in base 10 and 29 in base 10, same thing. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being added, but the result is the sum of their individual digits. For example, 29's digits sum to 11, 29's digits sum to 11. 11+11=22. Not 58. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers, but each number is reversed first. For example, 29 reversed is 92, 29 reversed is 92. 92+92=184. Not 58. So that's not working.\n\nHmm. All the examples fit addition. So maybe the instruction is simply to add the two numbers. But why would the user present this as a problem? It's possible that the user is testing whether the assistant can recognize the simplest pattern. Alternatively, maybe there's a different operation when considering the numbers as strings rather than integers. For example, concatenating them and then converting to a number. Let's check.\n\nFirst input: 29 and 29. Concatenated as 2929. As a number, that's 2929. Not 58. So that's not it. Second input: 20 and 68. Concatenated as 2068. Not 88. Third input: 43 and 51. Concatenated as 4351. Not 94. So that's not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the numbers are being added, but the result is the sum of the digits of the original numbers. For example, 29's digits sum to 11, 29's digits sum to 11. 11+11=22. Not 58. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the sum of the two numbers, but each number is split into its digits and then summed. For example, 29 is 2 and 9, sum 11; <|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>",

Hmm, so there are five input-output pairs here. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right.\n\nFirst input is 52 and 68, output is 120. Second input 61 and 96 gives 157. Third input 14 and 95 gives 109. Fourth input 12 and 96 gives 108. Fifth input 26 and 58 gives 84. Alright.\n\nSo the task is to find a mathematical operation or combination of operations that takes two numbers (the inputs) and produces the third number (the output). Since all outputs are integers, maybe it's some arithmetic operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or perhaps a combination. Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at each pair and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst pair: 52 and 68. Output is 120. Let's compute possible operations. If we add them: 52+68=120. Oh! That works. Wait, 52 + 68 equals exactly 120. So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers? Let's check the other pairs to confirm.\n\nSecond pair: 61 and 96. Adding them gives 61+96=157. Which matches the output. Third pair: 14+95=109. Yes, that's correct. Fourth pair: 12+96=108. Correct again. Fifth pair: 26+58=84. Also correct. Wait a minute, all outputs are just the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers together. But let me double-check because sometimes there might be a trick or a different operation involved, especially if the numbers don't fit perfectly. Let's verify each one again.\n\nFirst input: 52+68=120 ✔️. Second: 61+96=157 ✔️. Third:14+95=109 ✔️. Fourth:12+96=108 ✔️. Fifth:26+58=84 ✔️. All of them add up correctly. So the instruction is simply to add the two numbers. But wait, why would the problem present this as a challenge then? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different operation. For example, sometimes problems involve concatenation, but here the outputs are single numbers, not strings. Or perhaps modulus? Let's check. For example, 52 mod 68 is 52, which isn't 120. 61 mod 96 is 61. Not matching. 14 mod 95 is 14. No. 12 mod 96 is 12. 26 mod 58 is 26. None of these give the outputs. So modulus doesn't seem to work.\n\nWhat about multiplication? Let's see. 52*68=3576, which is way larger than 120. 61*96=5856. Nope. So multiplication is out.\n\nSubtraction? 52-68=-16, not 120. 61-96=-35. Not matching. So subtraction isn't it.\n\nDivision? 52/68 is 0.764..., 61/96≈0.635. Not integers. So division probably isn't the case.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe adding the digits of the numbers. Let's check. For 52 and 68: 5+2=7, 6+8=14. 7+14=21. Not 120. Doesn't work. Similarly, 61+96:6+1=7, 9+6=15. 7+15=22≠157. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining the numbers in some way. Like 52 and 68 could form 5268, but 5268 divided by something? 5268 / 44 = 119.727... Not 120. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the sum of the two numbers plus some constant. Let's see. For example, 52+68=120. If there's a constant added, but in this case, 120 is exactly the sum. So maybe no constant needed. Let's check the others. 61+96=157, which is exactly the output. 14+95=109. 12+96=108. 26+58=84. All match exactly. So the instruction is to add the two numbers. But why does the problem ask for this? It seems straightforward. Maybe the user wants to confirm that the solution is indeed simple addition. Alternatively, perhaps there's a hidden step or a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me check once more. For example, maybe the inputs are treated as numbers in a different base? But the outputs are all in base 10. Let's see. For instance, if 52 and 68 were in base 10, their sum is 120. If they were in another base, say base 8, 52 in base 8 is 5*8 +2=42 in decimal, 68 in base 8 is 6*8 +8=64. Sum is 42+64=106, which is not 120. So that doesn't help. Similarly, base 9: 52_9 is 5*9+2=47, 68_9 is 6*9+8=62. Sum is 109, which is the third output. Wait, the third input is 14 and 95. If 14 and 95 were in base 9, 14_9 is 1*9 +4=13, 95_9 is 9*9 +5=95. Sum is 108, which is the fourth output. Interesting. Wait, let's check that.\n\nIf the first input is 52 and 68 in base 9, then 52_9 is 5*9 +2=47, 68_9 is 6*9 +8=62. Sum is 47+62=109. But the output is 120. So that doesn't align. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are being converted to another base before adding. Let's see. For example, if the inputs are in base 10, adding them gives the output. But if they were in base 8, adding them gives a different result. But none of the outputs match except when they are in base 10. So perhaps the initial assumption is correct: the instruction is to add the two numbers in base 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being concatenated and then divided by something. For example, 52 and 68 concatenated is 5268. Divided by 44 gives 119.727..., which is close to 120 but not exact. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the sum of the two numbers multiplied by something. Let's see. For example, 52+68=120. If you multiply by 1, it's 120. 61+96=157. Multiply by 1. 14+95=109. Multiply by 1. 12+96=108. Multiply by 1. 26+58=84. Multiply by 1. So that's not helpful. Unless there's a scaling factor. Let's check. For example, 52+68=120. If you divide by 1, same. 61+96=157. Divide by 1. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being added and then some digits are removed. For example, 52+68=120. If you remove the leading digit, you get 20. Not 120. Doesn't work. Or maybe reverse the digits. 52 reversed is 25, 68 reversed is 86. 25+86=111. Not 120. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being added and then multiplied by a certain factor. For example, 52+68=120. If you multiply by 1, same. 61+96=157. Multiply by 1. So no. Unless there's a different multiplier for each pair. Let's see. For example, 52+68=120. If multiplied by 1. 61+96=157. If multiplied by 1.1, that would be <|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **add the two numbers**. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **",

Hmm, so there are five input-output pairs here. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right.\n\nFirst pair: Input is 13 and 79, Output is 92.\nSecond: 36 and 36 gives 72.\nThird: 3 and 89 gives 92.\nFourth: 12 and 50 gives 62.\nFifth: 23 and 23 gives 46.\n\nSo, the instruction must be something that takes two numbers and combines them in a way that produces these outputs. Let's think about possible operations. Since all outputs are two-digit numbers, maybe it's some combination of digits from the inputs. Let's look at each pair.\n\nStarting with the first one: 13 and 79. The output is 92. Let's see the digits. 13 has digits 1 and 3. 79 has 7 and 9. How can these combine to 92? Maybe adding some digits or concatenating. If we add 1+3=4, 7+9=16. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe take the last digit of each number. For 13, last digit is 3; for 79, last digit is 9. Then 3 + 9 = 12. But 12 isn't 92. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe reverse the digits? 13 reversed is 31, 79 reversed is 97. Adding 31 +97=128. No, not 92. Wait, but the output is 92. Maybe subtract instead? 97 -31=66. Still not. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by combining the tens and units digits in some way. Let's check the third input: 3 and 89. Output is 92. So 3 is the first input, 89 is the second. The output is 92. The digits here: 3 (from first input) and 9 (from second input's units place). 3 and 9 make 39, which is not 92. Alternatively, maybe 8 (from 89's tens place) and 2 (from 92's units place)? 8 and 2 make 82. Not matching. Wait, 92 is 9 and 2. Maybe the tens digit of the second input and the units digit of the first? For 3 and 89: 8 (tens of 89) and 3 (units of 3) → 83. Not 92. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the two numbers. Let's check. First input: 13+79=92. Oh! That works. Second input: 36+36=72. Third input: 3+89=92. Fourth:12+50=62. Fifth:23+23=46. Wait, that seems to fit all the outputs. Let me verify each pair:\n\n1. 13 +79=92 ✔️\n2. 36+36=72 ✔️\n3. 3+89=92 ✔️\n4. 12+50=62 ✔️\n5. 23+23=46 ✔️\n\nOh! So the instruction was simply to add the two numbers together. That makes sense. All the outputs are the sum of the two inputs. Let me double-check if there's any other possible operation. For example, maybe concatenation? Like 13 and 79 concatenated would be 1379, which is way larger than 92. So no. Or maybe some other arithmetic operation. Let's see: 13*79=1027, which is way bigger. 36*36=1296. Not matching.

So we have five pairs here. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. Input: 69 95 → Output: 164\n2. Input: 30 36 → Output: 66\n3. Input: 4 43 → Output: 47\n4. Input: 6 70 → Output: 76\n5. Input: 50 70 → Output: 120\n\nHmm. The task is to find a mathematical or logical relationship between each pair of numbers in the input and the corresponding output. Since there are two numbers in the input and one in the output, it's likely a function that takes two variables, say x and y, and produces z. So maybe z = f(x, y). Let's think about possible operations.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first example: 69 and 95 give 164. Let's see what 69 + 95 is. That's 164. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the output. So 69 + 95 = 164. That works. Let me check the other examples.\n\nSecond input: 30 + 36 = 66. Yes, that's the output. Third: 4 + 43 = 47. Correct. Fourth: 6 + 70 = 76. Yep. Fifth: 50 + 70 = 120. Perfect. So all the outputs are just the sum of the two inputs. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Is there any chance that the instruction could be something else?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a different operation. For example, sometimes people use concatenation, but in these cases, adding gives the correct result. Let's see if any of the sums don't match. Let's verify each one:\n\n1. 69 + 95 = 164 ✔️\n2. 30 + 36 = 66 ✔️\n3. 4 + 43 = 47 ✔️\n4. 6 + 70 = 76 ✔️\n5. 50 + 70 = 120 ✔️\n\nAll of them add up correctly. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers. But why would the friend write such a simple instruction? Maybe the original problem had more complexity, but perhaps the user made a mistake in transcribing the inputs or outputs. Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the instruction involves some other operation, like multiplying and then adding something. Let's test that. For example, maybe (x * y) + something. Let's see:\n\nTake the first input: 69*95=6555. Then adding something to get 164. That doesn't make sense. Similarly, 30*36=1080, which is way larger than 66. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtracting and then adding. Like x - y + something. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 69-95=-26. Not 164. Doesn't work.\n\nWhat about division? 69/95 is less than 1. Not matching. Multiplication is too big. So addition seems to fit perfectly.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction is to take the two numbers, concatenate them as strings, then convert back to integer. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 69 and 95. Concatenated as \"6995\", which is 6995. Not 164. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some other combination. For example, x + y + something. But in all cases, x + y equals the output. So unless there's a hidden step, like converting to another base, but that seems unlikely. Let's check if any of the numbers are in a different base. For example, 164 in decimal is 164. If the input numbers were in another base, but that complicates things. Let's see:\n\nIf 69 and 95 were in base 10, they are 69 and 95. If they were in base 8, 69_8 is 6*8 +9=57, 95_8 is 9*8+5=77. Sum is 57+77=134, which isn't 164. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to add the digits of the two numbers. Let's check:\n\nFor 69: digits 6 and 9 sum to 15. 95: 9+5=14. Total sum 15+14=29. Not 164. So no.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction is to multiply the two numbers and then add the product of their digits. Let's test:\n\nFirst input: 69*95=6555. Product of digits: 6*9*9*5=1215. 6555+1215=7770. Not 164. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the squares? 69² +95² = 4761 + 9025=13786. No.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers and then add the number of letters in the word for the output. But that seems convoluted. For example, 164 has four letters. 69+95=164, plus 4 gives 168. Not matching. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers and then subtract the number of letters in the input words. But the inputs are numbers, so that doesn't apply. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers and then multiply by some factor. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs: 164, 66, 47, 76, 120. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Let's check ratios:\n\n164 / (69+95) = 164/164=1\n\n66/(30+36)=66/66=1\n\n47/(4+43)=47/47=1\n\n76/(6+70)=76/76=1\n\n120/(50+70)=120/120=1\n\nOh! All outputs are equal to the sum of the inputs. So the instruction is simply to add the two numbers. That's straightforward. But why would the friend write this? Maybe the original problem was presented differently, but according to the given data, addition fits perfectly. So the answer should be that the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Are there any possible alternative interpretations? For example, maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers and then subtract 1, but in all cases, the output is exactly the sum. So that's not the case. Or maybe there's a different operation when the numbers are even or odd. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 69 (odd) +95 (odd) =164 (even). Second: 30 (even)+36 (even)=66 (even). Third:4 (even)+43 (odd)=47 (odd). Fourth:6 (even)+70 (even)=76 (even). Fifth:50 (even)+70 (even)=120 (even). So the outputs vary between even and odd, depending on the inputs. So no, there's no parity-based rule here. It's just pure addition.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is to add the two numbers. So the answer is that the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **add the two numbers**. \n\n**Analysis of Input-Output Pairs:**\n1. **69 + 95 = 164**  \n2. **30 + 36 = 66**  \n3. **4 + 43 = 47**  \n4. **6 + 70 = 76**  \n5. **50 + 70 = 120**  \n\nIn each case, the output directly matches the sum of the two input values.

Hmm, so there are five input-output pairs here. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right.\n\nFirst pair: Input is 21 and 65, Output is 86. Second: 55 and 60 → 115. Third: 41 and 46 → 87. Fourth: 61 and 80 → 141. Fifth: 5 and 47 → 52. \n\nAlright, need to find a pattern or rule that connects each pair. Let's start by looking at the numbers. Maybe it's a mathematical operation between the two numbers in the input. Let's check addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, maybe some combination.\n\nLet's take the first example: 21 + 65 = 86. Oh, wait! That adds up exactly to 86. Let me check the others. 55 + 60 = 115. Yep, that works. 41 + 46 = 87. Also correct. 61 + 80 = 141. That adds up too. And 5 + 47 = 52. Wait, 5+47 is 52? Yes, that's right. So all these outputs are just the sum of the two numbers in the input. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check each one.\n\nFirst input: 21 + 65 = 86. Correct. Second: 55+60=115. Right. Third:41+46=87. Yes. Fourth:61+80=141. Correct. Fifth:5+47=52. Yep. So all outputs are simply the sum of the two numbers. Then why is this a puzzle? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Is there any other possible operation?\n\nWait, maybe the instruction isn't just adding them. Let me check if there's another operation that could fit. For example, sometimes people use concatenation, but here the outputs are single numbers, not strings. So concatenation probably isn't it. What about multiplication? Let's see: 21*65=1365, which doesn't match 86. 55*60=3300, nope. So that's not it. How about subtraction? 21-65=-44, which isn't 86. 55-60=-5, nope. Division? 21/65≈0.323, not 86. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different operation. Let's consider if the output is the sum of the squares of the two numbers. Let's test that. For the first input: 21² +65² = 441 + 4225 = 4666, which is way bigger than 86. So no. How about sum of cubes? 21³ +65³ is even larger. Not matching. \n\nWhat if it's a different combination, like (a + b) * something. Let's see. For the first input, 21+65=86. If we multiply by 1, it's still 86. But then the second input:55+60=115. If we multiply by 1, same thing. But the outputs are same as sums. So maybe the instruction is \"add the two numbers\". But that seems too simple. Maybe the problem is designed to trick us into thinking it's more complicated, but it's actually straightforward. \n\nWait, let me check the fifth input again. 5 +47=52. Yes. So all outputs are indeed the sum. But why would the friend write an output for each input? It's possible that the instruction was simply to add the two numbers. But maybe there's a catch. Let me think again. Are there any cases where the sum might not be the case? For example, maybe the instruction involved some modulus or other operations. Let's check with the first input: 21+65=86. If we take modulo 10, 86 mod 10 is 6, which doesn't match. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add the two numbers and then subtract something. Let's see. For example, 21+65=86. If we subtract 0, it's 86. But that's the same as adding. So perhaps the instruction is just to add them. \n\nBut maybe the problem is designed to test if we notice that all outputs are sums. However, sometimes in puzzles, there might be a hidden step. Let me check if there's any other possible pattern. For example, maybe the first number is multiplied by 2 and added to the second. Let's test that. First input: 21*2 +65=42+65=107≠86. Nope. Second input:55*2+60=110+60=170≠115. Not matching. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first number is squared and the second is cubed, then summed. 21² +65³=441+274625=275066≠86. No. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the product of the two numbers plus something. For example, 21*65 + x=86. 21*65=1365. 1365 +x=86 → x= -1279. Doesn't make sense. Similarly for others. \n\nWait, maybe the instruction involves some other operation. Let's think differently. Perhaps the output is the sum of the digits of the two numbers. Let's check. For 21 and 65: 2+1=3 and 6+5=11. Sum of digits would be 3+1+1=5, which is not 86. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers multiplied by some factor. For example, 21+65=86. If multiplied by 1, same. 55+60=115. If multiplied by 1, same. So that's the same as before. \n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to add the two numbers and then reverse the digits. Let's check. 21+65=86. Reversed is 68, which is not 86. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers plus the product. Let's see. For 21+65=86. Product is 1365. 86+1365=1451≠86. So no. \n\nHmm. All the examples fit the sum. Maybe the answer is that the instruction was to add the two numbers. But why would the friend write outputs for each input? Unless there's a trick. Wait, maybe the inputs are pairs, and the output is the sum. But that seems too obvious. Let me check once more. \n\nWait, let's look at the fifth input:5 and47. 5+47=52. Yes. So all outputs are sums. Therefore, the instruction must have been to add the two numbers. But maybe the problem is designed to test if you overlook the simplicity. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different operation when considering the numbers in another way. For example, maybe the first number is multiplied by 2 and added to the second. Let's check. 21*2 +65=42+65=107≠86. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first number is subtracted from the second. 65-21=44≠86. No. \n\nWait, what if the instruction was to concatenate the two numbers and then convert to a number? For example, 21 and65 become 2165. But 2165 is not 86. So no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the two numbers, but written in a different base. Let's check. For example, if the sum is in base 10, but maybe the output is in base 16. Let's see. 86 in base 10 is 56 in base 16. 115 in base 10 is 73 in base 16. 87 is 57 in base 16. 141 is 8D in hex. 52 is 34 in hex. None of these match the outputs. So that's not it. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction involves some other mathematical operation, like exponentiation. For example, 21^65 is way too big. 55^60 is impossible. So no. \n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers and then subtract the smaller number. Let's check. For 21 and65: 86-21=65. Which matches the second number.
