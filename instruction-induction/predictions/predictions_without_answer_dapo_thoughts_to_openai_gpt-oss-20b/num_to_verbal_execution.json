Convert the digit in the thousands place.  \n2. Convert the digit in the hundreds place.  \n3. Convert the digits in the tens and units places together if they form a number between 10 and 19 or convert them separately otherwise.\n\nLet's apply this approach to a new number, say 4231.\n\nStep 1: Break down the number 4231.  \n- 4 is in the thousands place.  \n- 2 is in the hundreds place.  \n- 3 is in the tens place.  \n- 1 is in the units place.\n\nStep 2: Convert each part.\n\n- The digit '4' in the thousands place means \"four thousand.\"  \n- The digit '2' in the hundreds place means \"two hundred.\"  \n- The digits '3' and '1' together form the number 31, which is \"thirty-one.\"\n\nLet's confirm this with the format used in the examples.\n\nFor the number 4231:\n\n- \"4\" thousand = \"four thousand\"  \n- \"2\" hundred = \"two hundred\"  \n- \"31\" = \"thirty-one\"<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|> The instruction is: **“Write the number in words, using the British convention of inserting ‘and’ before the last part (tens‑and‑units) when"
