Likely \"Write the number in words, using British English style, with 'and' after thousands and hundreds, but not after tens? The outputs show: 9067 -> \"nine thousand and sixty-seven\" (no comma). 5087 -> \"five thousand and eighty-seven\". 853 -> \"eight hundred and fifty-three\". 1277 -> \"one thousand, two hundred and seventy-seven\" (comma after thousand). 7520 -> \"seven thousand, five hundred and twenty\" (comma after thousand). So rule: use comma after thousand if number >= 1000? But 9067 had no comma. Maybe because 9067 is less than 10,000? But 1277 also less than 10,000 but had comma. So maybe rule: if thousands digit is 1? No. 9067 thousands digit 9, no comma. 5087 thousands digit 5, no comma. 1277 thousands digit 1, comma. 7520 thousands digit 7, comma. So maybe rule: if thousands digit is 1 or 7? Not consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: if number of digits in thousands part >1? 9067 has 1 digit thousand part (9). 5087 also 1. 1277 has 1. 7520 has 1. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: if number of digits in hundreds part >1? 1277 has hundreds digit 2, 7520 has 5. 9067 has 0. 5087 has 0. So maybe comma if hundreds digit non-zero? 1277 has 2 -> comma. 7520 has 5 -> comma. 9067 has 0 -> no comma. 5087 has 0 -> no comma. 853 has no thousands, no comma. So rule: put comma between thousands and hundreds if hundreds digit non-zero. That matches.\n\nThus instruction: \"Write the number in words, using British English, with a comma between the thousands and hundreds if the hundreds digit is non-zero, and include 'and' before the last two digits.\" Also include 'and' before tens if any.
