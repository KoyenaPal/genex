Hmm, looking at the examples, each input word is transformed into an output with some pattern. Let me start by comparing each input and output pair.\n\nFirst, take the first input \"HELLO\" which becomes \"H3LL0\". Let's break it down. The original letters are H, E, L, L, O. The output is H followed by 3, then L, L, 0. So E becomes 3, O becomes 0. Similarly, in the second input \"WORLD\", the output is W0RLD. So R becomes 3? Wait, no. Wait, WORLD is W, O, R, L, D. Output is W0RLD. So O becomes 0, R becomes 3? Wait, but in the first example, O becomes 0. Then in the second example, O is also 0. So maybe replacing certain letters with numbers here. Let's check other letters.\n\nLooking at the first output: H3LL0. So H stays H, E becomes 3, L stays L, L stays L, O becomes 0. So the rule here seems to be replacing E with 3 and O with 0. But wait, in the second input, \"WORLD\" becomes \"W0RLD\". So O is replaced with 0. Similarly, in the third input, \"ALPHA\" becomes \"4LPH4\". Here, A becomes 4, P becomes 4? Wait, no. Let's see: A is replaced with 4, L stays L, P becomes 4? Wait, no. Wait, \"ALPHA\" is A, L, P, H, A. Output is 4, L, P, H, 4. So A becomes 4, P becomes 4? Or maybe the first occurrence of A is 4, and the second A is also 4. Wait, but in the fourth input, \"FRIEND\" becomes \"FR13ND\". F is F, R is 1, I is 3, E is 3, N is N, D is D. So R becomes 1, E becomes 3. Wait, but in the first example, E was 3. So maybe replacing vowels with numbers? Let's check the vowels in each input and output.\n\nWait, let's list all the vowels in the inputs and see if they are replaced by specific numbers:\n\nFirst input: HELLO (E, O). Output: H3LL0. So E→3, O→0.\n\nSecond input: WORLD (O). Output: W0RLD. O→0.\n\nThird input: ALPHA (A, E, O). Output: 4LPH4. A→4, E→3, O→0.\n\nFourth input: FRIEND (I, E). Output: FR13ND. I→1, E→3.\n\nFifth input: MACHINE (I, E). Output: M4CH1N3. I→4? Wait, no. Wait, MACH1N3: M, A, C, H, 1, N, E. So I is not present here. Wait, maybe I is replaced by 1? Let's check other examples where I appears.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: FRIEND has I and E. Output is FR13ND. So I becomes 1, E becomes 3.\n\nIn the fifth input, \"MACHINE\" becomes M4CH1N3. So I is replaced by 1. So perhaps vowels are being replaced as follows:\n\nA → 4\n\nE → 3\n\nI → 1\n\nO → 0\n\nU → ?\n\nWait, let's check if U is replaced. Let's look at the inputs where U might appear. For example, in the third input, \"ALPHA\" doesn't have U. Fourth input: FRIEND (no U). Fifth input: MACHINE (no U). Let's check another input. The second input is \"SECRET\" which becomes S3CR3T. So C is replaced by 3. Wait, but in the first example, E is 3. So maybe certain letters are replaced by 3 when they are vowels or consonants?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the first example, E is replaced by 3. In the second example, O is replaced by 0. Third example, A is replaced by 4, E by 3, O by 0. Fourth example, I is replaced by 1, E by 3. Fifth example, I is replaced by 1, E by 3.\n\nSo vowels are being replaced as:\n\nA → 4\n\nE → 3\n\nI → 1\n\nO → 0\n\nU → ?\n\nBut where is U replaced? Let's check if any input has U. For example, in the fifth input, \"INPUT\" becomes 1NPUT. So I is replaced by 1, but U is not present. Let's check another input. The fourth input is \"FRIEND\" which becomes FR13ND. No U. How about the third input: \"PASSWORD\" becomes P4SSW0RD. So A→4, S→5? Wait, S is replaced by 5? Wait, password is P, A, S, S, W, O, R, D. Output is P4SSW0RD. So S is replaced by 5? Because P4SSW0RD has 5 instead of S. Wait, S is replaced by 5? Let's check that.\n\nWait, in the third input, \"PASSWORD\" becomes P4SSW0RD. So the S's are replaced by 5. So S→5. Similarly, in the fourth input, \"COMPUTER\" becomes C0MPUT3R. The T is replaced by 3? Wait, no. Let's see: \"COMPUTER\" is C, O, M, P, U, T, E, R. Output is C0MPUT3R. So O→0, U→?, T→3? Wait, T is replaced by 3 here. But in the first example, R was replaced by 3. Wait, in the first example, \"HELLO\" becomes H3LL0. So R is replaced by 3. Wait, but in the second example, \"WORLD\" becomes W0RLD. So R is replaced by 3. Wait, so R→3? Let's check that.\n\nLooking at the first input: HELLO → H3LL0. R is replaced by 3. Second input: WORLD → W0RLD. R is replaced by 3. Third input: ALPHABET? Wait, no, third input is \"ALPHA\" → 4LPH4. So P is replaced by 4. Fourth input: FRIEND → FR13ND. R is replaced by 1? Wait, no. Wait, FRIEND is F, R, I, E, N, D. Output is FR13ND. So R is replaced by 1. Wait, but in the first example, R is replaced by 3. So this contradicts. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, first input: HELLO → H3LL0. The letters are H, E, L, L, O. So R is not present. So R is not replaced here. Wait, but in the second input, WORLD → W0RLD. So R is replaced by 3. Third input: ALPHABET? No, third input is \"ALPHA\" → 4LPH4. So P is replaced by 4. Fourth input: FRIEND → FR13ND. So R is replaced by 1. Wait, that's inconsistent. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction involves replacing certain letters with numbers based on their position in the alphabet, but with some exceptions. Let's think about that. For example, A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26. But replacing letters with numbers based on their position. However, the outputs don't seem to follow that directly. For example, H is 8, but in the first output, H remains H. E is 5, but in the first output, E becomes 3. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe replacing vowels with numbers and consonants with something else, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, let's look again at the outputs:\n\nFirst output: H3LL0. So H stays, E→3, L stays, L stays, O→0.\n\nSecond output: W0RLD. W stays, O→0, R→3, L stays, D stays.\n\nThird output: 4LPH4. A→4, L stays, P→4, H stays, A→4.\n\nFourth output: FR13ND. F stays, R→1, I→3, E→3, N stays, D stays.\n\nFifth output: M4CH1N3. M stays, A→4, C stays, H stays, 1 (I?), N stays, E→3.\n\nHmm. So vowels are being replaced as:\n\nA → 4\n\nE → 3\n\nI → 1\n\nO → 0\n\nU → ?\n\nBut where is U replaced? Let's check if any input has U. For example, the fifth input is \"INPUT\" → 1NPUT. So I is replaced by 1, but U is not present<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input word has been transformed into an output with some pattern. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule that the friend used to create these outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a common transformation applied to each word. Let's start with the first pair:\n\nInput: ALGORITHM → Output: 4LG0R1THM\nBreaking down the letters:\nA → 4 (looks like an A but maybe a stylized 4)\nL → L stays as L\nG → G becomes 0 (zero)\nO → O becomes 1\nR → R becomes 2? Wait, no. Wait, in the second input, OBJECT becomes 0BJ3CT. So O is 0, B is B, J is J, E is 3, C is C, T is T. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's replacing certain letters with numbers or symbols. Let's check each letter in ALGORITHM:\n\nA → 4\nL → L\nG → 0\nO → 1\nR → 2? But in the output, it's 4LG0R1THM. Wait, after G comes O which is 1, then R. So R is replaced with 2? Because 4 L G 0 R 1 T H M. Wait, but in the output, the R is followed by 1. So maybe R is replaced with 2? But in the second input, OBJECT becomes 0BJ3CT. Let's look at that:\n\nOBJECT → 0BJ3CT\nO → 0\nB → B\nJ → J\nE → 3\nC → C\nT → T\nSo here, E is replaced with 3. Similarly, in the third input, ABSTRACT becomes 4BST4CT. Let's check that:\n\nABSTRACT → 4BST4CT\nA → 4\nB → B\nS → S\nT → T\n4 → 4? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the original input is ABSTRACT. The output is 4BST4CT. So A is 4, B is B, S is S, T is T, then 4 again? Wait, maybe the 'A' in ABSTRACT is replaced with 4, and the 'T' at the end is replaced with 4? Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the first output: 4LG0R1THM. Let's see each character:\n\nOriginal: A L G O R I T H M\nOutput: 4 L G 1 R 1 T H M\nWait, the O is replaced with 1, and the I is replaced with 1? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the first input-output pair:\n\nInput: ALGORITHM → Output: 4LG0R1THM\n\nBreaking down each letter:\n\nA → 4\nL → L\nG → 0\nO → 1\nR → 2? Because after G (0) comes O (1), so maybe R is 2. Then I (the next letter) would be 3? But in the output, after R comes 1. Wait, the original input is ALGORITHM. Let's write them out:\n\nA L G O R I T H M\n\nOutput: 4 L G 1 R 1 T H M\n\nSo A→4, L→L, G→0, O→1, R→2? But then I is 1? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 'I' is replaced with 1 because it's the ninth letter (I is the ninth letter of the alphabet?), but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the 'I' is replaced with 1 due to some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vowels are being replaced with numbers. Let's check:\n\nIn the first output: 4 (A), L, G (0), 1 (O), R, 1 (I?), T, H, M. Wait, but the original input's I is the eighth letter (I is the 9th letter?), so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced based on their position in the alphabet, but with some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second input-output pair:\n\nInput: CLASS → Output: CL4SS\n\nC → C\nL → L\nA → 4\nS → S\nS → S\nSo A is replaced with 4. Similarly, in the first input, A is replaced with 4. So maybe the first letter (A) is replaced with 4. But in the third input, ABSTRACT → 4BST4CT. The first letter is A, replaced with 4. Then B remains B, S remains S, T is replaced with T? Wait, no. The output is 4BST4CT. So A→4, B→B, S→S, T→4? But why?\n\nWait, maybe the vowels are being replaced. Let's check the vowels in the inputs:\n\nALGORITHM: A, O, I (but I is sometimes considered a vowel). So A→4, O→1, I→1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced based on their position in the alphabet, but with some substitution. For example, A is the first letter, so maybe replaced with 4 (which is the fourth letter?), but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second output: CL4SS. The 'A' is replaced with 4. So maybe the first letter is replaced with 4. But in the third input, ABSTRACT starts with A, which is replaced with 4. Then B is B, S is S, T is replaced with T? Wait, no. The output is 4BST4CT. So after 4, we have B S T 4 C T. So T is replaced with 4? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are being converted to their corresponding ASCII values and then modified. Let's check:\n\nTake the first input: ALGORITHM. Let's convert each character to its ASCII code:\n\nA: 65 → 4 (maybe subtract 61? 65-61=4)\nL: 76 → 76-61=15, but in the output it's L. So that doesn't fit.\nG: 71 → 71-61=10, but in output it's 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replacing certain letters with symbols. For example, A becomes 4, O becomes 0, I becomes 1, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first output: 4LG0R1THM. So A→4, O→0, I→1. Similarly, in the second output: CL4SS. A→4, S→5? No, S is 83 in ASCII. Maybe not.\n\nWait, let's look at the second input-output pair: OBJECT → 0BJ3CT. So O→0, B→B, J→J, E→3, C→C, T→T. So E is replaced with 3. Similarly, in the third input, ABSTRACT → 4BST4CT. A→4, B→B, S→S, T→4, C→C, T→T. So T is replaced with 4 here. In the fourth input, STRING → STR1NG. S→S, T→1, R→1, I→N? Wait, no. Wait, STRING becomes STR1NG. So S→S, T→1, R→1, I→N? Wait, original input is S-T-R-I-N-G. Output is S-T-R-1-N-G. So I is replaced with 1. Similarly, in the fifth input, EXCEPTION → 3XC3PT10N. E→3, X→X, C→C, E→3, P→P, T→T, I→1, O→0, N→N. So I is replaced with 1 here as well.\n\nSo looking at this, it seems that certain letters are being replaced with numbers or symbols. Let's list the replacements observed so far:\n\nA → 4\nO → 0\nI → 1\nE → 3\nT → 4 (in some cases)\nBut wait, in the first output, after G (0) comes O (1), then R (2?), but in the second output, E is 3. So maybe the replacement is based on the position in the alphabet plus some offset. Let's check:\n\nA is the first letter. If we replace it with 4, maybe it's 1 + 3 = 4. But that's arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their corresponding Roman numerals? A is not a Roman numeral. Alternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their Unicode characters. For example, A could be replaced with a different character. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are being converted to their hexadecimal ASCII codes. Let's check:\n\nTake the first input: ALGORITHM. Let's take each character and see if their ASCII codes correspond to something.\n\nA: 65 in ASCII. 65 in hex is 41. But the output is 4, which is different. So<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input word has been transformed into an output with some pattern. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule that converts each input to its corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a common pattern across them. Let's start with the first pair:\n\nInput: DEBUG → Output: D3BUG\nLooking at this, the letters in \"DEBUG\" have been replaced with numbers or symbols. Let's compare each character:\nD → D (no change)\nE → 3\nB → B (no change)\nU → U (no change)\nG → G (no change)\nWait, but the output is D3BUG. So maybe the 'E' is replaced with '3', and the other letters remain the same. Let me check the next input.\n\nSecond input: COMPILER → C0MP1L3R\nOriginal letters: C O M P I L E R\nOutput: C 0 M P 1 L 3 R\nSo here, O becomes 0, I becomes 1, E becomes 3. That's a pattern. Let's note that vowels might be replaced with certain characters. For example, O→0, I→1, E→3. Then the other letters stay as is. Let's check the third input.\n\nThird input: EXECUTE → 3X3CUT3\nOriginal: E X E C U T E\nOutput: 3 X 3 C U T 3\nSo E→3, U→U (wait, no, in the output it's 3X3CUT3. Wait, the original E's are replaced with 3s. The U in the middle is kept as U. So maybe only the first and last E's? Wait, in \"EXECUTE\", the first E is replaced with 3, the second E is also replaced with 3. The U is kept as U. So perhaps vowels are replaced except for U? Or maybe the replacement depends on position?\n\nWait, let's look at the fourth input: TERMINAL → T3RM1N4L\nOriginal: T E R M I N A L\nOutput: T 3 R M 1 N 4 L\nSo E→3, I→1, A→4. Hmm. So maybe vowels are being replaced with specific symbols. Let's see:\n\nA → 4\nE → 3\nI → 1\nO → 0\nU → U (maybe not, since in the first example, U wasn't changed. Wait, in the first input, U was kept as U. But in the second input, the U in \"COMPILER\" was kept as U. Wait, but in the third input, the U in \"EXECUTE\" was kept as U. Wait, but in the fourth input, TERMINAL's A is replaced with 4. So maybe vowels are replaced except for U? Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's check the fifth input: SCRIPT → SCR1PT\nOriginal: S C R I P T\nOutput: S C R 1 P T\nSo I is replaced with 1. So maybe all vowels except U are replaced. Let's see:\n\nIn the first input, U is kept. In the second input, U is kept. Third input, U is kept. Fourth input, A is replaced. Fifth input, I is replaced. So maybe vowels are replaced except U. But wait, in the second input, the I in \"COMPILER\" is replaced with 1. So maybe all vowels except U are replaced with specific symbols. Let's see:\n\nA → 4\nE → 3\nI → 1\nO → 0\nU remains as U.\n\nBut wait, in the first input, U is kept. So maybe U is the only vowel not replaced. Let's check the outputs again:\n\nFirst input: D E B U G → D3BUG. So E→3, U→U, others same. Second input: C O M P I L E R → C0MP1L3R. O→0, I→1, E→3. Third input: E X E C U T E → 3X3CUT3. E→3, U→U, E→3. Fourth input: T E R M I N A L → T3RM1N4L. E→3, I→1, A→4. Fifth input: S C R I P T → SCR1PT. I→1.\n\nSo vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are being replaced, except U. Wait, but in the first input, U is kept. So maybe U is the only vowel not replaced. Let's confirm:\n\nIn the first input, U is kept. In the second input, I is replaced. Third input, U is kept. Fourth input, A is replaced. Fifth input, I is replaced. So yes, vowels except U are replaced. So the rule is: replace each vowel (A, E, I, O) with specific symbols, and leave U as is.\n\nNow, what symbols are they replaced with?\n\nLet's list the replacements from the outputs:\n\nA → 4\nE → 3\nI → 1\nO → 0\nU → U\n\nSo the vowels are replaced as follows:\n\nA becomes 4\nE becomes 3\nI becomes 1\nO becomes 0\nU stays as U\n\nThat seems consistent across all examples. Let's verify with each input-output pair.\n\nFirst input: DEBUG → D3BUG. Original letters: D E B U G. Replacements: E→3, U→U. Correct.\n\nSecond input: COMPILER → C0MP1L3R. Letters: C O M P I L E R. Replacements: O→0, I→1, E→3. Correct.\n\nThird input: EXECUTE → 3X3CUT3. Letters: E X E C U T E. Replacements: E→3, U→U, E→3. Correct.\n\nFourth input: TERMINAL → T3RM1N4L. Letters: T E R M I N A L. Replacements: E→3, I→1, A→4. Correct.\n\nFifth input: SCRIPT → SCR1PT. Letters: S C R I P T. Replacements: I→1. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is replacing each vowel (A, E, I, O) with 4, 3, 1, 0 respectively, and leaving U unchanged. Now, the instruction given to the friend must have been to replace each vowel in the input word with these symbols. However, looking at the outputs, sometimes the letters are written in uppercase. Wait, let's check the case of the letters.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nFirst output: D3BUG. All letters are uppercase except the numbers. Wait, no, D is uppercase, 3 is lowercase. Wait, but in the input, all letters are uppercase. The outputs seem to mix uppercase and lowercase letters. Wait, let's check:\n\nFirst input: DEBUG (all caps). Output: D3BUG. So D is uppercase, 3 is lowercase. But in the second output: C0MP1L3R. C is uppercase, 0 is lowercase. Similarly, the rest of the letters are uppercase. So the output uses a mix of uppercase letters and lowercase numbers/symbols. But how does that fit into the instruction?\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to replace vowels with the specified symbols, but keep the rest of the letters in their original case. However, in the outputs, the letters are all uppercase. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\nFirst output: D3BUG. D is uppercase, 3 is lowercase. So the letters are in uppercase, but the symbols are lowercase. So the instruction might have been to replace vowels with the specified symbols regardless of case, but the rest of the letters are kept as uppercase. But in the outputs, all letters are uppercase. Wait, but in the first input, the output is D3BUG. So D is uppercase, 3 is lowercase. So the letters are in uppercase, but the symbols are lowercase. So the instruction might have been to replace vowels with the specified symbols, keeping the rest of the letters in uppercase. But why are the symbols lowercase?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace vowels with the specified symbols, and the rest of the letters are converted to uppercase. But in the first input, the output is D3BUG, which has D uppercase and 3 lowercase. So that contradicts. Therefore, perhaps the instruction was to replace vowels with the specified symbols, and the rest of the letters are left as they were (i.e., lowercase in the input become lowercase in the output, uppercase remain uppercase). But in the first input, the input is all uppercase, so the output would have uppercase letters except where vowels are replaced. But in the first output, D is uppercase, 3 is lowercase. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, maybe the instruction was to replace vowels with the specified symbols, and the rest of the letters are converted to uppercase. But then in the first input, the output would be D3BUG with all letters uppercase except the 3. Which isn't the case. So perhaps the instruction was to replace vowels with the specified symbols, and the rest of the letters are kept in their original case. But in the first input, the output is D3BUG, which has D uppercase and 3 lowercase. So that suggests that<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input word has been transformed into an output with certain substitutions. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule or pattern that the friend used to create these outputs from the inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input words and their corresponding outputs to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at the first pair:\nInput: FUNCTION → Output: FUNCT10N\nBreaking down the output: Each letter in the input is replaced except for the first three letters 'FUN'. Then, the remaining letters 'CTION' become 'CT10N'. Wait, but the output is 'FUNCT10N', so maybe the first three letters are kept as is, and the rest have some substitution. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input-output pair:\nIF → 1F. So replacing 'I' with '1' and 'F' with 'F'? Wait, no. Wait, the input is 'IF' and output is '1F'. So the first character 'I' becomes '1', and the second 'F' stays as 'F'. Hmm. But in the next pair, ELSE becomes 3LS3. So 'E' becomes '3', 'L' becomes 'L', 'S' becomes 'S', 'E' becomes '3'. So maybe vowels are being replaced with numbers? Let's check.\n\nWait, let's look at the first example again. Input: FUNCTION. Output: FUNCT10N. The first three letters 'FUN' remain the same. Then 'CTION' becomes 'CT10N'. So 'C' stays, 'T' stays, 'I' becomes '1', 'O' becomes '0', 'N' stays. So maybe after the first three letters, vowels are replaced with numbers: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→? Not sure about U here. But in this case, 'I' becomes '1', 'O' becomes '0'.\n\nLet's check the second input: ELSE → 3LS3. So 'E' becomes '3', 'L' stays, 'S' stays, 'E' becomes '3'. So vowels E are replaced with 3. Similarly, in the third input: BREAK → BR34K. The 'E' becomes '4', which is another vowel substitution. So maybe vowels are being replaced with specific numbers: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→? Not sure yet. Let's see more examples.\n\nFourth input: IMPORT → 1MP0RT. So 'I' becomes '1', 'M' stays, 'P' stays, 'O' becomes '0', 'R' stays, 'T' stays. So again, vowels I and O are replaced with 1 and 0. Fifth input: CLASS → CL4SS. 'A' becomes '4', 'S' stays. So maybe A is replaced with 4.\n\nNow looking at the second set of outputs. For example, IF becomes 1F, which is straightforward. Else becomes 3LS3. So 'E' is 3. Switch becomes SW1TCH. The 'E' in 'ELSE' is 3, but in 'SWITCH', the 'E' is not present. Wait, 'SWITCH' is S W I T C H. So the 'I' becomes 1. So perhaps vowels are replaced as follows: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→? Let's check.\n\nIn the first output: FUNCTION → FUNCT10N. The 'I' in 'CTION' is replaced with 1. So yes, I→1. The 'O' becomes 0. So O→0. Then, in the second output: ELSE → 3LS3. The 'E's are replaced with 3. Third output: BREAK → BR34K. The 'E' becomes 4. Fourth output: IMPORT → 1MP0RT. The 'O' becomes 0. Fifth output: CLASS → CL4SS. The 'A' becomes 4.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be replacing certain vowels with numbers. Let's list the substitutions:\n\n- A → 4\n- E → 3\n- I → 1\n- O → 0\n- U → ? Not sure yet. Wait, in the given examples, there's no U. Let's check if any input contains U. Looking at the inputs:\n\nInputs are:\nFUNCTION, VARIABLE, CONSTANT, LOOP, RETURN\nIF, ELSE, SWITCH, CASE, DEFAULT\nFOR, WHILE, DO, BREAK, CONTINUE\nIMPORT, EXPORT, PACKAGE, MODULE, LIBRARY\nCLASS, OBJECT, METHOD, PROPERTY, INTERFACE\n\nNone of these words contain the letter U. So maybe U isn't part of the substitution here. So the vowels involved are A, E, I, O.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output is FUNCT10N. The 'CTION' part: C T I O N. So I→1, O→0. So that's consistent. In the second example, ELSE becomes 3LS3. The two E's become 3 each. In BREAK, the E becomes 4. So E is replaced with 3, 4, or both? Wait, in BREAK, it's B R E A K. The E is replaced with 4. So maybe E is replaced with 3 when it's in certain positions? Or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs again. For example, in the first output, the 'CTION' becomes 'CT10N'. So the 'I' is 1, 'O' is 0. The 'C' and 'T' stay. So maybe after the first three letters (FUN), the rest of the letters are processed with substitutions. But then, in the second output, 'ELSE' becomes '3LS3'. So the first three letters 'ELS' would be... but the output starts with '3LS3'. Wait, 'ELS' would be E L S. But the output is 3 L S 3. So the first E is replaced with 3, the next E is also replaced with 3. So maybe whenever there's an E, it's replaced with 3, regardless of position. But in the first example, the 'I' is replaced with 1, and 'O' with 0. So maybe vowels are replaced based on their position or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substitution is based on the letter's position in the alphabet. Let's check:\n\nA is the first letter, so maybe replaced with 4? Not sure. E is the fifth letter, replaced with 3. I is the ninth letter, replaced with 1. O is the 15th letter, replaced with 0. That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe substituting vowels with numbers based on their position in the word. For example, the first occurrence of a vowel is replaced with a number, but that might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substitution is replacing vowels with numbers based on their sound. For example, 'A' sounds like 4, 'E' like 3, etc. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\nFor example, in the first output, 'VARIABLE' becomes 'V4R14BL3'. Let's break that down:\n\nOriginal: V A R I A B L E\n\nOutput: V4R14BL3\n\nSo the vowels are:\n\nA → 4\n\nI → 1\n\nA → 4\n\nE → 3\n\nSo that's consistent with the previous pattern. Similarly, 'CONSTANT' becomes 'C0NST4NT':\n\nOriginal: C O N S T A N T\n\nOutput: C0NST4NT\n\nSo O→0, A→4, N→N, T→T. So vowels O and A are replaced.\n\nAnother example: 'SWITCH' becomes 'SW1TCH'. Original S W I T C H. Output S W 1 T C H. So I→1.\n\nIn 'CASE', the output is 'C4S3'. Original C A S E. Output C4S3. So A→4, E→3.\n\nIn 'DEFAULT', output is 'D3F4ULT'. Original D E F A U L T. Output D3F4ULT. So E→3, A→4, U remains (since there's no substitution for U in the given examples). Wait, but U wasn't present in the inputs. So maybe U is left as is unless it's part of a substitution rule we haven't discovered yet.\n\nWait, but in the fifth input-output pair, 'INTERFACE' becomes '1NT3RF4C3'. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: I N T E R F A C T I O N E\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is 'INTERFACE', which is I N T E R F A C T I O N E? Wait, no. Let me check the actual word. 'INTERFACE' is spelled I-N-T-E-R-F-A-C-T-I-O-N-E? No, that's not right. Let me spell it correctly. I-N-T-E-R-F-A-C-T-I-O-N-E? Wait, no. Let's count the letters:\n\nI (1), N (2), T (3), E (4), R (5), F (6), A (7), C (8<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, each with a set of terms transformed into a specific pattern. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule that converts the inputs into outputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs to see if there's a common pattern.\n\nLooking at the first pair:\nInput: BOOLEAN, STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, DOUBLE\nOutput: B00L34N, STR1NG, 1NT3G3R, FL04T, D0UBL3\n\nHmm, each output seems to have letters replaced with numbers or symbols. Let's break down each word:\n\n- BOOLEAN → B00L34N: B stays B, O becomes 0, U becomes 0, T becomes 3 (maybe T→3?), I becomes 4, N becomes N. Wait, but the 'O' in BOOLEAN is replaced with 0, and the 'U' becomes 0. Then the 'T' becomes 3. So maybe vowels are replaced with certain numbers? Let's check other words.\n\nSTRING → STR1NG: S, T, R, 1 (instead of I?), N, G. So the 'I' in STRING is replaced with 1. But in BOOLEAN, the 'I' is replaced with 4. That doesn't match. Maybe it's not based on vowels. Let's look at other letters.\n\nINTEGER → 1NT3G3R: I becomes 1, N stays N, T becomes 3, E becomes 3, G stays G, R stays R. Wait, the 'E' here is replaced with 3. But in the first output, like in B00L34N, the 'I' is 4. So maybe different letters are mapped to different symbols. Let's see:\n\nIn BOOLEAN:\nB → B\nO → 0\nU → 0\nT → 3\nI → 4\nN → N\n\nIn STRING:\nS → S\nT → 3\nR → R\nI → 1\nN → N\nG → G\n\nWait, but in STRING, the 'I' is replaced with 1, which is different from BOOLEAN's 'I' being 4. So maybe each letter has its own replacement. Let's make a table.\n\nLet me list all the letters involved in the first two outputs:\n\nFrom BOOLEAN:\nB, O, U, T, I, N\n\nFrom STRING:\nS, T, R, I, N, G\n\nSo combining these, letters involved are B, O, U, T, I, N, S, R, G.\n\nNow, looking at their replacements:\n\nBOOLEAN:\nB → B\nO → 0\nU → 0\nT → 3\nI → 4\nN → N\n\nSTRING:\nS → S\nT → 3\nR → R\nI → 1\nN → N\nG → G\n\nWait, but in both outputs, T is replaced with 3. So maybe T is always 3. Similarly, N is N in both. Let's check other letters.\n\nIn the first output, the 'I' in BOOLEAN is replaced with 4, and in STRING, the 'I' is replaced with 1. So perhaps 'I' is mapped to different symbols depending on the context? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position of the letter in the alphabet. Let's check:\n\nB is the 2nd letter. In BOOLEAN's output, B remains B. Not sure.\n\nO is the 15th letter. Replaced with 0. Maybe O is replaced with 0 because 15 mod something? 15 mod 9 is 6, but 0 isn't 6. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nU is the 21st letter. Replaced with 0. 21 mod 9 is 3, but again, 0 isn't 3. Not sure.\n\nT is the 20th letter. Replaced with 3. 20 mod 7 is 6, but 3 isn't 6. Maybe not.\n\nI is the 9th letter. Replaced with 4. 9 mod 5 is 4. Oh! 9 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 4. So maybe replacing the 9th letter (I) with 4. Similarly, O is 15th, which is 15 mod 11 is 4? Not sure. Wait, maybe the replacement is based on the number of letters before a certain point. Alternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their position in the alphabet minus some value modulo another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the letter's position in the alphabet, but using a different base. For example, replacing letters with their value in a different numeral system. Let's see:\n\nTake the letter 'B' which is 2. If we use base 3, 2 in base 3 is 2. But in the output, B remains B. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their Unicode code points. Let's check:\n\nB's Unicode is 66. In the output, it's B. So no change. O is 79 → 0. How does 79 become 0? Maybe subtract 79 from 79? No. Alternatively, maybe replace letters with their ASCII values modulo 9. Let's see:\n\nFor O (ASCII 79): 79 mod 9 is 79 - 8*9=79-72=7. 7 mod 9 is 7. Not 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the letter's position in the alphabet, but using a different cipher. For example, ROT13, but that's shifting letters. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the first output:\n\nBOOLEAN → B00L34N\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nB → B (unchanged)\nO → 0\nU → 0\nT → 3\nI → 4\nN → N\n\nSo O becomes 0, U becomes 0, T becomes 3, I becomes 4, N remains N.\n\nSimilarly, STRING → STR1NG:\n\nS → S\nT → 3\nR → R\nI → 1\nN → N\nG → G\n\nSo T is 3, I is 1, N is N.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be replacing certain letters with digits or symbols. Let's see if there's a consistent mapping.\n\nLooking at the letters that are changed:\n\nIn BOOLEAN:\nO → 0\nU → 0\nT → 3\nI → 4\nN → N\n\nIn STRING:\nO → 0\nU → 0\nT → 3\nI → 1\nN → N\nS → S\nR → R\nG → G\n\nWait, but in STRING, S is replaced with S, so no change. R and G remain as well. So maybe the letters that are replaced are those that are vowels or have certain positions. But O and U are vowels, but in STRING, I is also a vowel and is replaced with 1. However, in BOOLEAN, I is replaced with 4. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of letters in the word. For example, replacing letters with their count. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs and see if they follow a pattern where each character is replaced by a number or symbol. For example, maybe the letters are being replaced with their position in the alphabet, but using a different base. Let's check:\n\nTake the letter 'B' which is 2. If we use base 3, 2 in base 3 is 2. But in the output, B remains B. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their value in a different numeral system. For example, hexadecimal. Let's see:\n\nB in hex is 11, but in the output it's B. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are being replaced with their Unicode code points. For example, O is 79, which is replaced with 0. How? 79 - 79 = 0. So maybe subtracting the Unicode value from itself? That would give zero. But then S is 83, which would be 83 - 83 = 0, but in the output S is S. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replacing letters with their ASCII values modulo 9. Let's check:\n\nO (79) mod 9: 79 /9=8*9=72, remainder 7. 7 mod9=7. Not 0.\n\nU (85) mod9: 85-9*9=85-81=4. 4 mod9=4. Not 0.\n\nT (84) mod9: 84-9*9=84-81=3. 3 mod9=3. So T becomes 3. That matches the output.\n\nI (73) mod9: 73-8*9=73-72=1. 1 mod9=1. So I becomes 1. Which matches STRING's output.\n\nN (78) mod9: 78-8*9=78-72=6.<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at all these input-output pairs, I need to find a pattern or rule that applies to each set.\n\nFirst, let me list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nLooking at the first set:\nInput: ENCRYPT, DECRYPT, PASSWORD, KEY, SECURITY\nOutput: 3NCRYPT, D3CRYPT, P4SSW0RD, K3Y, S3CUR1TY\n\nWait, let's break down each output word. For example, ENCRYPT becomes 3NCRYPT. The 'E' is replaced with '3', 'N' stays, then 'CRYPT'. So maybe replacing certain letters with numbers? Let's check other words.\n\nDECRYPT becomes D3CRYPT. The 'E' is replaced with '3', others stay. Similarly, PASSWORD becomes P4SSW0RD. The 'A' is replaced with '4', 'S' with '5'? Wait, no. Wait, P4SSW0RD: P is P, A is 4, S is S, W is W, O is 0, R is R, D is D. So maybe vowels are replaced with numbers? But wait, in DECRYPT, the 'E' becomes '3', which is not a vowel. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution cipher where certain letters are replaced by numbers. Let's see:\n\nENCRYPT → 3NCRYPT: E→3, N stays, C stays, R stays, Y stays, T stays. So only the first letter E is replaced with 3.\n\nDECRYPT → D3CRYPT: same as above, E→3.\n\nPASSWORD → P4SSW0RD: A→4, S→5? Wait, but here it's P4SSW0RD. So P is P, A→4, S is S, S→S, W→W, O→0, R→R, D→D. So maybe vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are replaced with numbers. Let's check:\n\nIn ENCRYPT, E is replaced with 3. So maybe E is 3, A is 4, I is 1, O is 0, U is 5? Wait, but in DECRYPT, there's no A or I. Let's check other outputs.\n\nKEY becomes K3Y. K is K, E→3, Y is Y. So E is 3 again. SECURITY becomes S3CUR1TY. S is S, E→3, C→C, U→1, R→R, I→1, T→T, Y→Y. So U and I are replaced with 1. Oh, so maybe vowels are replaced as follows: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→5. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair:\n\nPROTOCOL → PR0T0C0L. Let's break it down. P is P, R→0, O→0, T→0, C→C, 0, L→L. So O is replaced with 0. That fits the previous idea. Then H34D3R: H is H, E→4, A→4, D is D, R is R. So E→4, A→4. So vowels: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→5.\n\nThird input: ENCODER → 3NC0D3R. E→3, O→0, N stays, C stays, D→D, E→3, R→R. So O is 0, which matches. DECODER → D3C0D3R. D stays, E→3, C stays, O→0, D→D, E→3. Same pattern.\n\nFourth input: BIT → B1T. B stays, I→1, T stays. So I is 1. BYTE → BYT3. Y stays, E→3. So E is 3. WORD → W0RD. O→0. REGISTER → R3G1ST3R. E→3, I→1, R stays. FLAG → FL4G. A→4.\n\nFifth input: CPU → C4PU. U→4? Wait, but according to the previous pattern, U should be 5. But here it's 4. Hmm, that's conflicting. Let's check the fifth output again. The input is CPU, GPU, RAM, ROM, CACHE. Output: CPU, GPU, R4M, R0M, C4CH3. So for RAM, R4M: R stays, A→4, M stays. ROM becomes R0M: R stays, O→0, M stays. CACHE becomes C4CH3: C stays, A→4, C stays, H stays, E→3. So here, A is 4, O is 0, U is 4 (in CPU, but output is CPU). Wait, in CPU, U is not changed. But in RAM, A is replaced with 4. So maybe the rule is different. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, in the first input, ENCRYPT becomes 3NCRYPT. The 'E' is replaced with '3', others remain. In the second input, PROTOCOL becomes PR0T0C0L. The 'O's are replaced with '0's. In the third input, ENCODER becomes 3NC0D3R. The 'O' is replaced with '0'. In the fourth input, BIT becomes B1T. The 'I' is replaced with '1'. BYTE becomes BYT3. The 'E' is replaced with '3'. So perhaps the rule is replacing certain vowels with specific numbers, but also some consonants like 'I' and 'E' are replaced. Let's list the replacements:\n\nLooking at all outputs:\n\nFrom the first input:\nENCRYPT → 3NCRYPT: E→3\nDECRYPT → D3CRYPT: E→3\nPASSWORD → P4SSW0RD: A→4, S→5? Wait, no. Wait, P4SSW0RD: P is P, A→4, S is S, S→S, W→W, O→0, R→R, D→D. So S is S, but in the output it's S0, so maybe S→0? Wait, no. Wait, in the first output, PASSWORD is P4SSW0RD. So S is S, but in the output it's S0. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe S is replaced with 0? Let's check other S's. In the second input, PAYLOAD becomes P4YL04D. The 'S' in PAYLOAD is replaced with 0. So S→0. Then in the third input, TRANSMIT becomes TR4NSM1T. The 'S' is replaced with N? No, that's not. Wait, TRANSMIT: T R A N S M I T. So the 'S' is replaced with N? No, the output is TR4NSM1T. So the 'S' is replaced with N? Wait, no. Let me look again. TRANSMIT → TR4NSM1T. The 'S' is replaced with N? No, the original is S, and the output is N. So maybe S→N? But that's inconsistent. Wait, maybe the 'S' is replaced with 'N' in some cases. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the 'S' is replaced with '5'? Because in the first output, PASSWORD has S→S0, but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is replacing vowels with numbers, but also some consonants. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first output: ENCRYPT → 3NCRYPT. E→3. DECRYPT → D3CRYPT. E→3. PASSWORD → P4SSW0RD. A→4, S→5? Wait, no. Wait, P4SSW0RD: P is P, A→4, S is S, S→S, W→W, O→0, R→R, D→D. So S is S, but in the output it's S0. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe S is replaced with 0? But in the second input, PAYLOAD becomes P4YL04D. The 'S' in PAYLOAD is replaced with 0. So S→0. Then in the third input, TRANSMIT becomes TR4NSM1T. The 'S' is replaced with N? No, that's not. Wait, TRANSMIT is T R A N S M I T. The 'S' is replaced with N? No, the output is TR4NSM1T. So the 'S' is replaced with N? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 'S' is replaced with '5'? But in the first output, S is S, but in the output it's S0. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is replacing vowels with numbers, and some consonants with symbols. Let's check:\n\nIn ENCRYPT → 3NCRYPT: E→3. DECRYPT → D3CRYPT: E→3. PASSWORD →<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five sets of input-output pairs, and each set seems to follow a certain pattern. My job is to find the common rule that transforms each input into its corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs to see if there's a pattern across them. Let me start with the first set:\n\nInput: LOGIN, LOGOUT, SESSION, TOKEN, COOKIE\nOutput: L0G1N, L0G0UT, S3SS10N, T0K3N, C00K13\n\nLooking at these, it looks like each character in the input word is being replaced with another character. Let's check each letter:\n\nFor \"LOGIN\":\nL -> L (no change)\nO -> 0\nI -> 1\nN -> N (no change)\nSo \"LOGIN\" becomes \"L0G1N\".\n\nSimilarly, \"LOGOUT\":\nL -> L\nO -> 0\nG -> G\nU -> 0\nT -> T\nOut -> 0UT? Wait, the output is \"L0G0UT\". So the 'U' becomes '0', and the 'T' remains 'T'. So \"LOGOUT\" becomes \"L0G0UT\".\n\nNext, \"SESSION\":\nS -> S\nE -> E\nS -> S\nS -> S\nI -> 1\nO -> 0\nN -> N\nSo \"S3SS10N\".\n\n\"TOKEN\":\nT -> T\nO -> 0\nK -> K\nE -> E\nN -> N\nSo \"T0K3N\".\n\n\"COOKIE\":\nC -> C\nO -> 0\nO -> 0\nK -> K\nI -> 1\nE -> E\nE -> E\nSo \"C00K13\".\n\nHmm, so the pattern here is replacing certain letters with numbers: O becomes 0, I becomes 1, S becomes 3, maybe others? Wait, let's check the second set to confirm.\n\nSecond input-output pair:\nFIREWALL → F1R3W4LL\nAntivirus → 4NT1V1RUS\nMalware → M4LW4R3\nPhishing → PH1SH1NG\nSpam → SP4M\n\nLet's break down each word:\n\nFIREWALL:\nF -> F\nI -> 1\nR -> R\nE -> E\nW -> W\nA -> A\nL -> L\nL -> L\nSo \"F1R3W4LL\". Wait, but where does the 3 come from? Maybe the 'E' is replaced with 3? Because in the first example, \"ENCRYPTION\" became \"3NCRYPT10N\", which suggests that 'E' is replaced with 3. Let's check that.\n\nIn the third input-output pair:\nENCRYPTION → 3NCRYPT10N\nDECRYPTION → D3CRYPT10N\nHASH → H4SH\nSALT → S4LT\nKEY → K3Y\n\nYes, here 'E' is replaced with 3. So that's a key substitution. Then, looking back at the first set:\n\nLOGIN → L0G1N: I is 1, O is 0, N is N, S is S, O is 0, I is 1, N is N. Wait, but in the first set, \"SESSION\" has S as S, but in the third set, \"ENCRYPTION\" has E as 3. So maybe the substitution is based on specific letters: O→0, I→1, S→3, and perhaps others?\n\nWait, let's check the fourth input-output pair:\n\nVPN → VPN (no changes)\nPROXY → PR0XY\nTOR → T0R\nHTTPS → HTTPS (no changes)\nSSL → SSL (no changes)\n\nSo here, \"PROXY\" becomes \"PR0XY\": P is P, R is R, O is 0, X is X, Y is Y. So O→0 again. Similarly, \"TOR\" becomes T0R: O→0. So the substitution seems consistent for O→0, I→1, S→3, and maybe other letters?\n\nWait, but in the first set, \"SESSION\" is S3SS10N. So S is S, then three S's, then I→1, O→0. So S is kept as S. But in the third set, \"ENCRYPTION\" becomes 3NCRYPT10N. So E is replaced with 3. So maybe the substitution is replacing vowels with certain numbers? Let's see:\n\nOriginal letters and their substitutions:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\nIn the first set:\nO → 0\nI → 1\nS → 3 (Wait, no. In the first set, S is S. Wait, but in the third set, E is replaced with 3. So maybe the substitution is not based on vowels. Let's check each substitution:\n\nFor the first set:\n\nLOGIN → L0G1N: O→0, I→1, N→N, S→S, O→0, I→1, N→N. So O→0, I→1.\n\nLOGOUT → L0G0UT: O→0, U→0, T→T. So U→0.\n\nSESSION → S3SS10N: S→S, S→S, S→S, I→1, O→0, N→N. So I→1, O→0.\n\nTOKEN → T0K3N: O→0, K→K, E→3, N→N. So E→3.\n\nCOOKIE → C00K13: O→0, O→0, K→K, I→1, E→3. So O→0, I→1, E→3.\n\nSo the substitutions here are O→0, I→1, E→3. But wait, in the third set, \"ENCRYPTION\" becomes 3NCRYPT10N. So E is replaced with 3. That matches. Then, in the second set, \"ANTIVIRUS\" becomes 4NT1V1RUS. Let's see:\n\nANTIVIRUS → 4NT1V1RUS. Let's break it down:\n\nA → 4 (since in the fourth set, \"AUTHENTICATION\" becomes 4UTH3NT1C4T10N. So A→4.)\n\nT → T\nI → 1\nV → V\nI → 1\nR → R\nU → U\nS → S\nSo \"4NT1V1RUS\".\n\nSimilarly, \"MALWARE\" → M4LW4R3. Let's see:\n\nM → M\nA →4\nL → L\nW → W\nA →4\nR → R\nE →3. So \"M4LW4R3\".\n\n\"PHISHING\" → PH1SH1NG. Let's check:\n\nP → P\nH → H\nI →1\nS → S\nH → H\nI →1\nN → N\nG → G. So \"PH1SH1NG\".\n\n\"SPAM\" → SP4M. S→S, P→4, A→4, M→M. So \"SP4M\".\n\nSo the substitutions here are A→4, I→1, E→3, O→0, S→S (wait, S is kept as S?), but in the first set, S is S. Wait, in the first set, \"SESSION\" is S3SS10N. So S is S. But in the third set, \"ENCRYPTION\" is 3NCRYPT10N. So E is replaced with 3. So the substitution rules seem to be:\n\n- Replace O with 0\n- Replace I with 1\n- Replace E with 3\n- Replace A with 4\n- Other letters remain the same.\n\nBut wait, in the first set, \"TOKEN\" becomes T0K3N. So O→0, K→K, E→3, N→N. That fits. \"COOKIE\" becomes C00K13: O→0, O→0, K→K, I→1, E→3. Correct.\n\nIn the second set, \"ANTIVIRUS\" becomes 4NT1V1RUS: A→4, I→1, V→V, I→1, R→R, U→U, S→S. Correct.\n\nThird set: \"ENCRYPTION\" → 3NCRYPT10N: E→3, N→N, C→C, R→R, Y→Y, P→P, T→T, etc. Wait, but in the third set, \"ENCRYPTION\" is 3NCRYPT10N. So E→3, N→N, C→C, R→R, Y→Y, P→P, T→T, I→1, O→0, N→N. So yes, E→3, I→1, O→0.\n\nFourth set: \"VPN\" → VPN (unchanged), \"PROXY\" → PR0XY (O→0), \"TOR\" → T0R (O→0), \"HTTPS\" → HTTPS (unchanged), \"SSL\" → SSL (unchanged). So O→0 here as well.\n\nFifth set:<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input word has been transformed into an output with some pattern. My job is to reverse-engineer the rule that converts the inputs into these outputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a common pattern across them. Let's start with the first set:\n\nInput: DATABASE, TABLE, ROW, COLUMN, QUERY\nOutput: D4T4B4S3, T4BL3, R0W, C0LUMN, QU3RY\n\nLooking at each output, it seems like each letter in the original word is being replaced with a number or symbol. Let's take \"DATABASE\" as an example. The original letters are D-A-T-A-B-A-S-E. The output is D4T4B4S3. So replacing A with 4, B with 8? Wait, but in the output, after the first A (position 2), it becomes 4. Then T is T, then another A becomes 4 again. Then B becomes 8 (since 4+4=8?), but wait, the next B in \"DATABASE\" is the third character. Wait, maybe not. Let me check each letter:\n\nOriginal: D A T A B A S E\nOutput: D 4 T 4 B 4 S 3\n\nSo A is replaced with 4, B with 8, T with T, S with S, E with 3. Hmm. But how does that work? Let's see:\n\nFor the first A (second character), it's replaced with 4. Then the next A (fourth character) is also 4. Then B (third character) is 8. Then another A (sixth character) is 4. Then E (eighth character) is 3. So maybe vowels are replaced with numbers, but which ones?\n\nWait, let's look at the second input-output pair:\n\nInput: INDEX, PRIMARY, FOREIGN, UNIQUE, KEY\nOutput: 1ND3X, PR1M4RY, F0R31GN, UN1QU3, K3Y\n\nHere, the vowels are replaced with certain numbers. For example, I becomes 1, E becomes 3, O becomes 0, Y becomes 5? Wait, but in the first output, E is 3. In the second output, E is 3 again. Let's check:\n\nIn \"INDEX\": I is 1, E is 3, X is X. So replacing I with 1, E with 3, O with 0, U with 5? Wait, in the third input-output pair:\n\nInput: TRIGGER, STORED, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, EVENT\nOutput: TR1GG3R, ST0R3D, PR0C3DUR3, FUNCT10N, 3V3NT\n\nHere, E is 3, O is 0, U is 5? Let's see:\n\nTRIGGER: T R I G G E R → T R 1 G G 3 R → so I is 1, E is 3. Similarly, in STORED: S T O R E D → S T 0 R 3 D → O is 0, E is 3. In PR0C3DUR3: P R 0 C 3 D U R 3 → U is 5? Wait, no. Here, U is replaced with 5? Because in the output, it's 0R31GN. Wait, the third input is FOREIGN, output is F0R31GN. So F O R E A G N. So E is 3, A is 4. Then in the output, the U in FOREIGN would be 5? Wait, no. FOREIGN is F-O-R-E-A-N-G. So the U isn't present here. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's check each input-output pair carefully.\n\nFirst pair: DATABASE → D4T4B4S3. So A→4, B→8, E→3. Second pair: INDEX → 1ND3X. I→1, E→3. Third pair: TRIGGER → TR1GG3R. I→1, E→3. Fourth pair: JOIN → J01N. I→0? Wait, J O I N → J 0 1 N. So O is 0, I is 1. Fifth pair: COMMIT → C0MM1T. I→1, M→0? Wait, C O M M I T → C 0 M M 1 T. So O is 0, M is 0, I is 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the fifth input-output pair: COMMIT → C0MM1T. So the first M is 0, the second M is 0, and I is 1. So maybe vowels are replaced with specific numbers, but consonants might have their own replacements. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLet's list all the vowels in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:\n\nInput words and their vowels:\n\n1. DATABASE: A, A, E\n   Output: 4, 4, 3 → So A→4, E→3.\n\n2. INDEX: I, E\n   Output: 1, 3 → I→1, E→3.\n\n3. TRIGGER: I, E\n   Output: 1, 3 → same as above.\n\n4. JOIN: O, I\n   Output: 0, 1 → O→0, I→1.\n\n5. COMMIT: O, I, M (but M is consonant)\n   Output: 0, 1, 0 → O→0, I→1, M→0.\n\nWait, but in the fifth input, COMMIT has two Ms. The first M is 0, the second M is 0. So consonants might be replaced with 0? Let's check other consonants.\n\nLooking at the first input: DATABASE. The consonants are D, T, B, S. Their outputs are D, T, B (as 8?), S. Wait, D is D, T is T, B is 8, S is S, E is 3. So consonants D, T, B, S remain the same except B becomes 8. Wait, but in the output, B is 8. So maybe B is replaced with 8. Let's check other consonants.\n\nSecond input: INDEX. Consonants are N, X. Output: N is N, X is X. So consonants N and X remain the same. Third input: TRIGGER. Consonants T, R, G, G, R. Output: T, R, G, G, R. So consonants unchanged. Fourth input: JOIN. Consonants J, N. Output: J becomes 0, N becomes 0. Fifth input: COMMIT. Consonants C, M, M, T. Output: C becomes 0, M becomes 0, T becomes 0. Wait, but in the fourth input, J becomes 0. So maybe certain consonants are replaced with 0. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n- D remains D\n- T remains T\n- B becomes 8\n- S remains S\n- N remains N\n- X remains X\n- R remains R\n- G remains G\n- J becomes 0\n- C becomes 0\n- M becomes 0\n- T becomes 0 (in COMMIT)\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the letters and their positions in the alphabet.\n\nFor example, A is the first letter. In the first output, A is replaced with 4. B is the second letter, replaced with 8. C is third, but in the first output, C is C. Wait, maybe letters are replaced based on their position plus some value. Let's check:\n\nA (1st letter) → 4. 1 + 3 = 4.\nB (2nd) → 8. 2 + 6 = 8.\nC (3rd) → C. No change.\nD (4th) → D. No change.\nE (5th) → 3. 5 - 2 = 3.\nF (6th) → F. No change.\nG (7th) → G. No change.\nH (8th) → H. No change.\nI (9th) → 1. 9 - 8 = 1.\nJ (10th) → 0. 10 - 10 = 0.\nK (11th) → K. No change.\nL (12th) → L. No change.\nM (13th) → 0. 13 -13=0.\nN (14th) → N. No change.\nO (15th) → 0. 15-15=0.\nP (16th) → P. No change.\nQ (17th) → Q. No change.\nR (18th) → R. No change.\nS (19th) → S. No change.\nT (20th) → T. No change.\nU (21st) → 5. 21-16=5.\nV (22nd) → V. No change.\nW (<|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction likely involved replacing each letter with its corresponding number based on a specific cipher.

Let me look at each pair carefully.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: SERVER, CLIENT, REQUEST, RESPONSE, API\nOutput: S3RV3R, CL13NT, R3QU3ST, R3SP0NS3, 4P1\n\nLooking at these, it looks like each letter is being replaced with a number that's two less than its position in the alphabet. For example, 'S' is the 19th letter. Two less would be 17, which is 'Q', but wait, the output here is '3' instead of 'Q'. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's replacing letters with numbers based on their position minus 2, but only if the result is a single digit. Let's check:\n\nTake 'S' (19th letter). 19-2=17, which is 'Q', but the output is '3'. That doesn't match. Maybe another approach. Let's see the first output: S becomes S3RV3R. Wait, maybe each character is replaced by a number that's two less than its position, but if the result is a single digit, replace it with that digit. But 'S' is 19, 19-2=17 → 'Q', but the output is '3'. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's replacing vowels with numbers? Let's check:\n\nOriginal letters in SERVER: S, E, R, V, E, R. Output: S3RV3R. So E becomes 3. Similarly, in CL13NT, C is C, L is L, 13NT. So maybe vowels are replaced with 3? Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nOriginal letters in JSON: J, O, N, A, M, E, N, A, L, S, K. Wait, no, the input is JSON, output is J50N. So J remains J, O becomes 5, N becomes N. So O is replaced by 5. That suggests that certain letters are being replaced by numbers. Let's see:\n\nIn the first output, SERVER becomes S3RV3R. So E is replaced by 3. Similarly, in CL13NT, I is replaced by 1. In R3QU3ST, U is replaced by 3. In R3SP0NS3, O is replaced by 0. And API becomes 4P1. So A is replaced by 4, P remains P, I is replaced by 1.\n\nWait, so maybe the rule is replacing certain letters with numbers based on some pattern. Let's list all the replacements from the first input-output pair:\n\nOriginal letters in SERVER: S, E, R, V, E, R → Output: S3RV3R. So E→3, R→V? No, R is still R. Wait, no, the output is S3RV3R. So the E's become 3, and the V remains V. Wait, but V is 22nd letter. 22-2=20, which is T. But V isn't replaced. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the letter's position minus 2, but only if the result is a single digit. If it's more than one digit, leave it as is. Let's check:\n\nFor 'E' (5th letter): 5-2=3 → 3. So E→3. That matches the first output. 'O' in JSON becomes 5. O is 15th letter. 15-2=13, which is 'M', but the output is 5. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, there are both letters and numbers. Maybe the instruction is to replace each vowel with a number. Let's check:\n\nIn the first output, E is replaced by 3 (which is the third letter), O is replaced by 0 (maybe?), but in the second input-output pair, XML becomes XML. X is 24, M is 13, L is 12. So no replacement there. So maybe vowels are replaced with numbers. Let's see:\n\nOriginal vowels in the first input: E, O, U, E, O. In the output, E→3, O→0, U→3. So vowels are replaced as follows: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, U→3. Wait, in the first input, there's no A, but in the second input, A is replaced by 4. Let's check the second input-output pair:\n\nInput: JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, HTML\nOutput: J50N, XML, Y4ML, CSV, HTML\n\nSo J remains J, O becomes 5, N remains N. So O→5. Then in the third input-output pair:\n\nInput: METHOD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nOutput: M3TH0D, G3T, P0ST, PUT, D3L3T3\n\nHere, E→3, O→0, T→0? Wait, M3TH0D: M, E→3, T→0, H, 0, D. So T is replaced by 0. Similarly, in the fourth input-output pair:\n\nInput: HEADER, BODY, FOOTER, SCRIPT, STYLE\nOutput: H34D3R, B0DY, F00T3R, SCR1PT, STYL3\n\nH→3, A→4, D→4? Wait, H34D3R: H→3, E→4, D→4? Wait, no. Original HEADER: H, E, A, D, E, R. Output: H34D3R. So E→3, A→4, D→4? Wait, but D is 4th letter. 4-2=2, which is C. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the letter's position minus 2, but only if the result is a single digit. Let's check:\n\nH is 8th letter. 8-2=6 → 'G', but output is 3. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for vowels only. Let's see:\n\nIn the first output, E→3 (vowel), O→0 (vowel), U→3 (vowel). In the second input, O→5 (vowel). Third input: E→3, O→0. Fourth input: A→4 (vowel), E→3, I→1 (vowel). Fifth input: O→0, U→3, A→4, E→3. So vowels are replaced as follows:\n\nA → 4\nE → 3\nI → 1\nO → 0\nU → 3\n\nBut how does this apply to consonants? For example, in the first input, R is replaced by V. Wait, no, in the first output, R is still R. Wait, maybe consonants are left as is, and vowels are replaced according to the above mapping. Let's check:\n\nIn the first input, SERVER: S, E, R, V, E, R. Output: S3RV3R. So E→3, V remains V. But V is a consonant. So that contradicts the idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for certain letters regardless of vowels. Let's look at the outputs again:\n\nFirst output: S3RV3R. So S is S, E→3, R→V, V→3, E→3, R→V. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for letters that are followed by a vowel. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the second input-output pair: JSON → J50N. J is J, O→5, N is N. So O is replaced by 5. Then in the third input-output pair: GET → G3T. G is G, E→3, T→0. So T is replaced by 0. In the fourth input: A→4, E→3, I→1. So maybe the rule is replacing certain letters with numbers based on their position minus 2, but only if the result is a single digit. Let's check:\n\nFor example, A is the 1st letter. 1-2 = -1, which is invalid. So maybe vowels are replaced as follows:\n\nA → 4 (since 1+3=4)\nE → 3 (5-2=3)\nI → 1 (9-8=1)\nO → 0 (15-15=0)\nU → 3 (21-18=3)\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So vowels are replaced with numbers based on their position minus 2, but if the result is a single digit, replace with that digit. Wait, but for A: 1-2=-1, which is invalid, so maybe they add 24 (the position of A) and subtract 2? Wait, no. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for letters that are followed by a<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at the examples provided, each input word has been altered in some way to produce the output. Let me break down each pair to see if there's a pattern.\n\nStarting with the first set:\nInput: ENCODE → Output: 3NC0D3\nENCODE becomes 3NC0D3. Let's compare each letter:\nE → 3 (maybe replacing E with 3)\nN → N stays the same\nC → C stays the same\nO → 0\nD → D stays the same\nE → 3 again. So it looks like replacing E with 3 and O with 0. Also, the letters are kept in order but with those substitutions.\n\nSecond input: DECODE → D3C0D3. Applying the same logic:\nD stays D, E→3, C→C, O→0, D→D, E→3. So same substitution here. So maybe the rule is replace E with 3 and O with 0. Let's check other examples.\n\nThird input: HASH → H4SH. H stays H, A→4, S→S, H→H. So A becomes 4. Wait, but in the first example, O became 0. So maybe vowels are being replaced? Let's see:\n\nIn ENCODE: E→3, O→0. DECODE: E→3, O→0. So vowels E and O are replaced. Then in DECODE's output, D3C0D3, the 'A' isn't present. But in the third example, H4SH: H,4, S, H. So A is replaced with 4. Wait, but where does the A come from? Maybe the original input has a vowel that's replaced. Let's check the third input: HASH. H, A, S, H. So A is replaced with 4. Similarly, in the fourth input: SIGN → S1GN. S, I, G, N. I is replaced with 1. And in the fifth input: VERIFY → V3R1FY. V, E, R, I, F, Y. E→3, I→1. So maybe the rule is replacing certain vowels with specific characters: E→3, O→0, A→4, I→1. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the second set of inputs:\nENCRYPT → 3NCRYPT. E→3, Y→Y (no change), C→C, R→R, Y→Y, T→T. So Y isn't changed. But in the first set, O was replaced. So maybe only certain vowels are replaced. Let's see:\n\nIn ENCRYPT, the vowels are E and Y. E is replaced with 3, Y remains. In DECRYPT, D3CRYPT: E→3, Y→Y. So same as above. So perhaps vowels E and I are replaced with 3 and 1 respectively. Let's check the third set:\n\nTLS → TL5. L→5. Wait, but L isn't a vowel. Hmm, maybe consonants are replaced with numbers? Wait, in the first example, ENCODE becomes 3NC0D3. The letters E, O are replaced with 3 and 0. Then in DECODE, same. So maybe vowels are replaced. But in the third example, H4SH: H,4, S, H. So A is replaced with 4. So maybe all vowels are replaced except maybe Y? Or maybe only certain vowels. Let's see:\n\nIn the first set, E and O are replaced. In the second set, E and O again. Third set, A is replaced. Fourth set, I is replaced. Fifth set, E and I. So maybe the vowels are E, O, A, I, U. But in the examples, only E, O, A, I are replaced. Let's check:\n\nENCODE → E→3, O→0. DECODE → E→3, O→0. HASH → A→4. SIGN → I→1. VERIFY → E→3, I→1. So vowels E, O, A, I are replaced. What about U? Not seen here. So maybe the rule is replacing each vowel with a specific character: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0. Then consonants remain the same. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst input: ENCODE → E→3, O→0 → 3NC0D3. Correct. DECODE → same. Second input: DECRYPT → E→3, Y→Y, C→C, R→R, Y→Y, T→T → 3NCRYPT. Correct. Third input: H4SH → H, A→4, S, H → correct. Fourth input: SIGN → S, I→1, G, N → S1GN. Correct. Fifth input: VERIFY → V, E→3, R, I→1, F, Y→Y → V3R1FY. Correct.\n\nNow checking the second set of outputs. For example, ENCRYPT becomes 3NCRYPT. Same substitution. DECRYPT → D3CRYPT. So same substitution. CERTIFICATE → C3RT1F1C4T3. Let's break that down: C, E→3, R, T, I→1, F→F, E→3, T, C, E→3. So yes, replacing E with 3, I with 1, and O with 0. Wait, but in the output here, there's an F1 which would be F→F, but according to our previous rule, vowels are replaced. Wait, F is not a vowel. So maybe consonants are replaced with numbers? Wait, no. Wait, in the first example, ENCODE becomes 3NC0D3. The letters E, O are replaced. So vowels are replaced. So consonants stay as is. So in the second example, ENCRYPT becomes 3NCRYPT. E→3, Y→Y, C→C, R→R, Y→Y, T→T. So consonants C, R, T remain. So the substitution is only for vowels. So vowels are replaced, others stay. So the rule is: replace each vowel in the input word with a specific character, keeping consonants the same. The vowels to replace are A, E, I, O, U. But in the examples, we have A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0. U hasn't appeared yet. Let's check the third set:\n\nHTTPS → H, U, T, S, P. So U is not replaced. So maybe U is not part of the substitution. So the vowels to replace are A, E, I, O. Let's confirm:\n\nIn the first set, O is replaced. In the second set, O is replaced. In the third set, A is replaced. In the fourth set, I is replaced. In the fifth set, E and I are replaced. So vowels A, E, I, O are replaced. U is not present in any input, so maybe it's left as is. So the substitution is:\n\nA → 4\nE → 3\nI → 1\nO → 0\n\nAnd consonants remain unchanged. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst input: ENCODE → E→3, O→0 → 3NC0D3. Correct.\nDECODE → same substitution. Correct.\nHASH → A→4 → H4SH. Correct.\nSIGN → I→1 → S1GN. Correct.\nVERIFY → E→3, I→1 → V3R1FY. Correct.\n\nSecond set:\nENCRYPT → E→3, Y→Y, C→C, R→R, Y→Y, T→T → 3NCRYPT. Correct.\nDECRYPT → same. Correct.\nCERTIFICATE → C, E→3, R, T, I→1, F, E→3, T, C, E→3 → C3RT1F1C4T3. Wait, but in the output given, it's C3RT1F1C4T3. Let's see: C, E→3, R, T, I→1, F, E→3, T, C, E→3. So yes, that's correct. So the substitution works here.\nPRIVATE → P, R, I→1, V, I→1, A→4, T, E→3 → PR1V4T3. Which matches the output PUBL1C. Wait, wait, the second input in the second set is PRIVATE → output PR1V4T3. Let's check: P, R, I→1, V, I→1, A→4, T, E→3. Yes, that's correct. And the output is PR1V4T3. Correct.\n\nThird set:\nTLS → T, L, S. No vowels. So remains T L S. But output is TL5. Wait, that's different. Wait, according to our substitution, consonants should remain. But here, L is replaced with 5. That contradicts our earlier conclusion. Hmm, this is a problem. Because in the third set, TLS becomes TL5. So L is replaced with 5. But according to the previous pattern, consonants shouldn't be changed. So this<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"
