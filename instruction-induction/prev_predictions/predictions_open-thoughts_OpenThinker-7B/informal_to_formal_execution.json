Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and each output seems to be a more formal or polite version of the input. Let me start by looking at each pair and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst pair: Input is \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So the output is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". That sounds like making it more formal. Similarly, the second input \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the output is rephrasing the thanks into a more elaborate expression of gratitude. Third input \"This song is fire.\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good.\" Again, replacing slang with a more standard adjective. Fourth input \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the output is changing the perspective from future-oriented (\"see you\") to expressing anticipation. Fifth input \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" So here, the output is rephrasing the confirmation into a more direct statement.\n\nLooking at all these transformations, the common thread seems to be converting casual or informal expressions into more formal, polite, or eloquent versions. Each output is a more elevated or refined version of the input. Now, the question is, what instruction would lead someone to do this?\n\nPossible instructions could be something like \"Polish the sentence by making it more formal and polite.\" Or maybe \"Rephrase each input into a more polite and elegant version.\" Alternatively, it could be about transforming informal language into more professional or literary phrasing.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another angle. Maybe the instruction was about translating the input into another language and then back, but that doesn't fit because the outputs are in English. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to use synonyms or more formal vocabulary. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal adjectives, etc.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"once you get there\" vs \"upon your arrival\". \"Once\" is a bit informal, and \"arrival\" is more formal. Similarly, \"thanks\" becomes \"assistance is much appreciated\", which is a longer, more formal way of expressing gratitude. \"Fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good\". \"See you\" is casual, replaced with \"look forward to meeting you\". \"Got what you said\" is colloquial, replaced with \"understood you\".\n\nSo the instruction might have been to take each input and rephrase it using more formal, polite, or elevated language. The key here is that each output is a more formal version of the input. Therefore, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more sophisticated or elegant form, possibly using synonyms or more complex sentence structures. But given the examples, the main transformation is replacing informal phrases with their more formal equivalents.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to convert the input into a more positive or appreciative tone. For instance, turning \"Thanks\" into \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" adds more detail and politeness. Similarly, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct confirmation without the slang.\n\nSo putting this all together, the most likely instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or eloquent version. The instruction might have been along the lines of \"Polish each sentence to make it more formal and polite,\" or \"Convert each input into a more refined and courteous expression.\"\n\nLet me verify if there's any other possible instruction. Could it be about correcting grammar? For example, fixing contractions or improving punctuation? But in the first example, \"Please call once you get there\" is grammatically correct, and the output is also correct. The second input is \"Thanks for your help,\" which is correct, and the output is correct as well. So grammar correction isn't the main focus here.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredible,\" \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival,\" etc. But the fifth input's output is \"I understood you\" instead of \"I got your message\" or something similar. So it's not just synonym replacement but a broader rephrasing.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is most likely to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elegant version. The key is that each output is a more elevated or refined version of the input, often adding more detail or using more formal language.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elegant version**. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Formalization**: Inputs like \"once you get there\" became \"upon your arrival,\" replacing informal phrasing with more formal terms.\n2. **Politeness**: Casual expressions (e.g., \"Thanks\") were transformed into more elaborate gratitude (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n3. **Elevated Language**: Slang or colloquialisms (e.g., \"fire\") were replaced with refined adjectives (\"incredibly good\").\n4. **Anticipation vs. Future Plans**: \"See you tonight\" shifted to \"I look forward to meeting you,\" altering perspective from future-oriented to expressed eagerness.\n5. **Confirmation Redirection**: \"I got what you said\" became \"I understood you,\" directly addressing comprehension without slang.\n\n### Final Instruction:\n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, and refined version.\"  \nThis aligns with the systematic transformation observed across all input-output pairs.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. So the instruction must have been something like \"Rewrite the sentence in your own words\" or similar. But wait, maybe there's more nuance here. Let me look at each pair carefully.\n\nFirst pair: Input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the output is a slightly different phrasing but keeps the same meaning. The subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various,\" but the main idea remains. Maybe the instruction was to paraphrase the sentence without changing the core meaning.\n\nSecond example: Input \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is rephrased using \"be able to\" instead of \"do,\" and \"accomplish\" is added. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase questions into different forms while maintaining the query's intent.\n\nThird input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" The output uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" which is a common way to rephrase first-person statements into more formal or indirect language. So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person thoughts into statements of opinion or belief.\n\nFourth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" This changes the structure from a yes/no question to a suggestion phrased as \"shall I...\" which is more polite. So the instruction might involve rephrasing questions into more formal or polite alternatives.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the output simplifies the phrase \"got what you said\" into \"understood you,\" which is a more direct expression of comprehension. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase expressions of understanding into simpler or more standard terms.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input sentence in their own words, ensuring that the meaning is preserved but the structure and wording are altered. Each example shows different aspects of paraphrasing: changing subject pronouns, rephrasing questions, converting first-person to third-person opinions, adjusting question structures for politeness, and simplifying expressions of understanding.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a specific pattern or key instruction that ties all these examples together. Let me check again. For instance, the first example just swaps \"I considered\" with \"Various approaches were considered.\" The second example changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" The third uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\" Fourth becomes a suggestion with \"Shall I...\" Fifth replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be something like \"Paraphrase each sentence to express the same meaning using different words.\" But looking at the outputs, some examples use more formal language (like \"my opinion\"), others adjust question types, and others simplify expressions. So maybe the instruction was broader, allowing for various types of paraphrasing as long as the core meaning is maintained.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was specifically about converting first-person statements into third-person, but the fifth example doesn't fit that. Or maybe it's about rephrasing questions into different forms. But the fifth example isn't a question, so that can't be it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some are more formal (e.g., \"Would you be able to accomplish...\"), others are simpler (\"I understood you\"). So the instruction might have been to rephrase in a more neutral or standard way, avoiding colloquialisms. Alternatively, it could be about making the sentences more polite or professional.\n\nWait, the second example changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite way of asking. The fourth example turns \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\" which is also more polite. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentences into more formal or polite versions. However, the first example doesn't fit that, nor does the third or fifth. The third example uses \"my opinion\" which is a bit more formal than \"I think,\" but not necessarily polite.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the sentences into passive voice? Let's check. First input: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" That's active to passive, but the second input is a question, which doesn't fit passive. Third input: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion,\" which isn't passive. Fourth: \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" which isn't passive. Fifth: \"I got...\" → \"I understood you,\" which is active to active but with a different verb. So passive voice isn't the answer.\n\nHmm. Another thought: maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentences into different tenses. But none of the examples show tense changes. The first input is present tense, output is past? Wait, no: \"considered\" is past tense, output is \"were considered,\" which is also past. So no change there. Second input is present tense, output is present. Third input is present, output is present. Fourth input is present, output is present. Fifth input is present, output is present. So no tense changes.\n\nWhat about negation? No examples show that. So probably not.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's list the possible instruction types based on the examples:\n\n1. Rephrase into third person (first example).\n2. Convert questions into different forms (second example).\n3. Express personal opinions formally (third example).\n4. Make questions more polite (fourth example).\n5. Simplify expressions of understanding (fifth example).\n\nBut how to unify these under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to \"Rephrase each sentence in your own words, ensuring the meaning is preserved.\" But that's too vague. However, the examples show different types of rephrasing. So perhaps the instruction was more specific, like \"Convert first-person statements into third-person,\" but the fifth example doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"Rephrase questions into different forms,\" but the first example isn't a question.\n\nWait, the first example is a statement, output is a statement. Second is a question, output is a question. Third is a statement, output is a statement. Fourth is a question, output is a question. Fifth is a statement, output is a statement. So the instruction might not be about question types but about rephrasing in general.\n\nLooking back, the outputs seem to vary in style and structure. The first example is a straightforward synonym swap. The second example changes the question structure. The third uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\" The fourth becomes a suggestion. The fifth simplifies \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or neutral tone, avoiding contractions or colloquial expressions. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" \"Can you...\" with \"Would you be able to...\" etc. But why would the fifth example fit that? Because \"I got...\" is informal, and \"I understood you\" is more formal.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the sentences into more concise or direct language. For example, \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (removing \"I\" and \"many\"). \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which adds \"able to\" and changes the structure. \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a polite alternative. \"I got...\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct expression of understanding.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentences into more formal, polite, or concise language. But how to phrase that as an instruction? Maybe \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite manner, preserving the original meaning.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been \"Paraphrase each sentence to express the same meaning using different words,\" which allows for various types of rephrasing as seen in the examples. Since the examples include different methods (changing subjects, adjusting question structures, using formal expressions, simplifying), the instruction might have been broad enough to cover all these cases.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend followed it for all inputs. So the instruction must be a single, general direction that encompasses all the observed outputs. Given that, the most encompassing instruction would be to rephrase each input into a different version while keeping the same meaning. However, the examples show specific types of rephrasing, so maybe the instruction was more specific but still general enough to cover all cases.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs, the first example is a synonym replacement. The second example changes the question structure. The third uses a more formal expression. The fourth becomes a suggestion. The fifth simplifies the phrasing. So perhaps the instruction was to \"Rephrase each sentence in your own words, using a different structure or vocabulary where appropriate,\" which allows for various methods as demonstrated.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to \"Convert each sentence into a more formal or polite version,\" which would explain the changes in the second and fourth examples. But the first example doesn't fit that, nor does the third or fifth. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs often use \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" which is a common<|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each sentence in your own words**, ensuring the core meaning remains intact but using different"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see what transformation or rule was applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input \"This song is fire.\" Output \"This song is incredibly good.\" So the original phrase uses \"fire\" as slang meaning great or awesome. The output replaces it with \"incredibly good,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Maybe the instruction was to replace informal slang with more standard phrasing?\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, the verb \"can't stand\" is rephrased as \"cannot tolerate.\" So perhaps the instruction is to convert certain collocations into their more formal equivalents. \"Can't stand\" is a colloquial expression, so replacing it with \"cannot tolerate\" makes it more formal.\n\nThird input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output \"Various approaches were considered.\" The original uses \"considered\" in the past tense, and \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches.\" So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing the sentence structure, perhaps making it more passive or using more formal adjectives. \"Considered\" might be changed to \"were considered\" to make it passive, and \"many\" to \"various.\"\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output \"I understood you.\" The original is a colloquial way of saying they understood. The output uses \"understood you\" instead. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more standard ones, like converting \"got what\" to \"understood.\"\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the input uses the pronoun \"I\" without a relative pronoun, but the output adds \"whom\" to make it more formal. So the instruction might involve adding relative pronouns like \"who\" or \"whom\" where they're omitted in informal speech.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction seems to be about converting informal or conversational language into more formal or written English. Let's check if there's a common rule or transformation that applies here.\n\nAnother angle: looking for patterns in the transformations. For example, the first input's \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\"—maybe replacing informal adjectives with more descriptive ones. The second input changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\"—replacing modal verbs with their negative forms. Third input's \"considered\" becomes passive voice. Fourth input's \"got what\" becomes \"understood.\" Fifth input's omission of \"whom\" is fixed.\n\nWait, but the fifth input's output uses \"whom,\" which is more formal. So maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more formal by adding such elements. But why only in the fifth case? Because the other outputs don't require that. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal ones, but in some cases, like the fifth input, it's about adding a relative pronoun for formality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using different structures. Let's see:\n\n1. Slang (\"fire\") → formal adjective phrase.\n2. Colloquial verb phrase (\"can't stand\") → formal equivalent.\n3. Active voice → passive voice.\n4. Informal expression (\"got what\") → formal verb.\n5. Omission of relative pronoun → insertion of \"whom\" for formality.\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, adjusting verb tenses, restructuring sentences, and adding relative pronouns where appropriate.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth input's output uses \"whom,\" which is less commonly used in modern English except in formal writing. So maybe the instruction is to make the writing more academic or formal, hence using such constructions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more precise vocabulary. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate,\" etc. But the third input's \"considered\" becomes \"were considered,\" which is a structural change rather than lexical.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a more complex structure. For example, expanding \"I considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" by making it passive and using \"various\" instead of \"many.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more specific synonyms. Like \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"stand\" → \"tolerate,\" \"approaches\" → \"ways,\" \"got what\" → \"understood,\" and \"met\" → \"encountered\" (but in the fifth input, it's \"whom\" added).\n\nHmm. Let's think about possible instructions that could cover all these cases. One possible instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal by replacing informal expressions, adjusting verb tenses, and restructuring sentences where necessary.\"\n\nBut let's test this against the examples. For the first input, replacing slang with formal phrasing. Second, changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" (formal). Third, changing active to passive and \"considered\" to \"were considered.\" Fourth, replacing \"got what\" with \"understood.\" Fifth, adding \"whom\" for formality.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Another angle: the fifth input's output uses \"whom,\" which is a relative pronoun. So maybe the instruction includes adding relative pronouns where they're omitted in informal speech. But why only in the fifth case? Because the others don't require that. So perhaps the instruction is broader: make the writing more formal by various means, including adding relative pronouns when appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more precise and formal language throughout. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal adjectives, restructuring sentences for clarity, etc.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more verbose or structured. For example, \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, possibly more elaborate sentence structure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more academic or professional tone, avoiding contractions, using more formal adjectives, and restructuring sentences.\n\nLet me check if there's a common thread. All the outputs are more formal than the inputs. The first input uses slang (\"fire\"), the second uses a contraction (\"can't stand\"), the third is active voice, the fourth is a colloquial expression, and the fifth omits a relative pronoun. So the instruction likely involves converting informal language into formal, which can include multiple aspects like replacing slang, expanding contractions, restructuring sentences, and adding formal elements like relative pronouns.\n\nTherefore, the instruction probably was: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, adjusting verb tenses, restructuring sentences, and adding any necessary formal elements such as relative pronouns.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **convert each input into a more formal version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace informal expressions with standard phrasing**:  \n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (slang → formal adjective phrase)  \n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (contraction → formal verb phrase)  \n\n2. **Adjust sentence structure**:  \n   - \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" (active → passive voice; \"many\" → \"various\")  \n\n3. **Clarify or expand vague terms**:  \n   - \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" (colloquialism → precise verb)  \n\n4. **Add formal elements**:  \n   - \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" (omitted relative pronoun → inclusion of \"whom\" for formality)  \n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, adjusting verb tenses, restructuring sentences, and adding any necessary formal elements such as relative pronouns.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? Let's check each example:\n\n1. Original is casual (\"See you\"), output is more formal and uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\".\n2. \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So replacing \"thanks\" with \"assistance\", adding \"much appreciated\".\n3. \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\". Both mean not true, but \"fabricated\" is more formal.\n4. \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So changing the phrasing from negative to neutral, using \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't\".\n5. \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\". Here, \"many\" is replaced with \"various\", which is a synonym but more formal.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. Let's verify each example against this hypothesis.\n\n1. Original is casual. Output uses \"look forward to\" (polite) instead of \"see you\".\n2. \"Thanks\" is replaced with \"Your assistance\", which is more formal. \"Much appreciated\" adds emphasis.\n3. \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (formal).\n4. \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\" (more polite and less direct).\n5. \"many approaches\" → \"various approaches\" (synonym, more formal).\n\nAnother possible angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more positive or appreciative tone. For example, the second input's output is more positive than the original. But the first input's output is also more formal but not necessarily positive. However, the third input's output is more formal but not positive. The fourth and fifth examples don't seem to add positivity, just formality.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about converting present tense to past? Let's check:\n\nOriginal 3: \"was made up\" → output \"was fabricated\". Both are past tense. So no, that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs or phrases with synonyms. For example, \"considered\" in input 5 becomes \"various approaches were considered\" – but that's a slight change in structure. Wait, input 5's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"considered\" remains, but \"many\" is replaced with \"various\".\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts. Let's see:\n\n- \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal)\n- \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance\" (more formal)\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (same meaning, more formal)\n- \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (less direct, more formal)\n- \"considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\" (replacing \"many\" with \"various\", which is a synonym but more formal)\n\nYes, this seems consistent. So the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. Alternatively, it could be about converting the input into a more positive or appreciative tone, but looking at all examples, the primary change seems to be formality rather than positivity.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to make the output more positive by rephrasing. For example, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is slightly more positive. Similarly, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is more positive. However, the other examples don't fit this pattern as well. For instance, \"See you tonight\" becomes a more formal greeting, but not necessarily positive. So maybe the main focus is on formality rather than positivity.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about converting the input into a more indirect or euphemistic expression? For example, \"made up\" is a direct way to say something isn't true, whereas \"fabricated\" is a more formal term. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" is direct, while \"find it hard to distinguish\" is more indirect. But this seems like a secondary aspect compared to formality.\n\nPutting it all together, the most consistent instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents. This aligns with all the examples provided. Therefore, the instruction was likely something along the lines of \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite tone,\" or \"Convert the input into a more formal expression by replacing informal terms with their more formal counterparts.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, typically by replacing informal or direct expressions with their more formal equivalents. This transformation emphasizes politeness, formality, and clarity. Below is the breakdown of how each input was processed:\n\n1. **Input:** \"See you tonight.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n   *Change:* Casual \"see you\" → formal \"look forward to meeting you.\"\n\n2. **Input:** \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n   *Change:* Gratitude (\"thanks\") → formal acknowledgment of help (\"assistance\").\n\n3. **Input:** \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   **Output:** \"The entire story was fabricated.\"  \n   *Change:* Informal \"made up\" → formal \"fabricated.\"\n\n4. **Input:** \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"  \n   *Change:* Direct negation (\"can't tell\") → indirect phrasing (\"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\n5. **Input:** \"I considered many approaches.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Various approaches were considered.\"  \n   *Change:* Informal \"many\" → formal synonym \"various.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite tone**, often by substituting informal or direct language with its more formal counterpart.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let's start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nHmm, so the original sentence is a greeting or farewell, and the output is a more formal or positive response. The key change here is replacing \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting,\" which adds a sense of anticipation rather than just a casual goodbye.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nHere, the question is about wanting to join someone, and the output uses \"shall I accompany,\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or offering assistance. The structure changes from \"do you want me...\" to \"shall I...\" which is a different phrasing but maintains the same meaning.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nThis seems like a translation from a direct thank you to a more formal expression of gratitude. The output expands on the original by specifying \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated,\" making it more elaborate.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nHere, the output is a direct synonym replacement. \"Can't stand\" is rephrased as \"cannot tolerate,\" keeping the same negative emotion but using a slightly more formal term.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\nThis is another synonym substitution. The original is a brief confirmation, and the output is a more complete phrase expressing understanding, possibly in a more conversational tone.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's list the possible patterns:\n\n1. **Formalization**: Some outputs seem more formal than the inputs. For example, \"look forward to\" vs. \"see you,\" \"accompany\" vs. \"want me to go with you,\" \"assistance\" vs. \"help,\" \"tolerate\" vs. \"can't stand,\" \"understood you\" vs. \"got what you said.\"\n\n2. **Politeness/Polite Requests**: The second input is a request for accompaniment, and the output uses \"shall I accompany,\" which is a polite way to ask. Similarly, the first output is a positive response instead of a neutral one.\n\n3. **Expansion of Phrases**: The third input is concise, and the output expands it into a longer sentence with more descriptive words.\n\n4. **Synonym Replacement**: The fourth and fifth examples replace phrases with synonyms but keep the same structure.\n\nAnother angle: Could it be that the instruction was to translate from informal to formal language? Or perhaps to rephrase in a more polite or professional manner?\n\nLooking at the first example: \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you.\" This is a shift from a casual greeting to a more formal or positive statement. Similarly, \"Do you want me...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or offering help. The third example takes a simple \"Thanks\" and turns it into a more elaborate expression of gratitude. The fourth and fifth are direct synonym replacements but in a more formal context.\n\nWait, but the fourth example is \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, both are negative expressions, but \"tolerate\" is a bit more formal than \"can't stand.\" However, \"can't stand\" is more colloquial. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more formal ones, but not necessarily always increasing formality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. Let's check:\n\n- \"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\" – more formal and positive.\n- \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\" – more polite.\n- \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" – more detailed and formal.\n- \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper\" – slightly more formal but still negative.\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" – more complete and formal.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be rephrasing the input into a more formal, polite, or positive version. But why would the fourth example use a synonym that's slightly more formal? Maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their more formal equivalents, even if they're not always more polite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using more elevated vocabulary and sentence structures. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: \"See you tonight.\" → Formal: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" (adds \"look forward to\", more formal)\n\nOriginal: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Formal: \"Shall I accompany you?\" (uses \"shall\" which is more formal, and \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\")\n\nOriginal: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Formal: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" (adds \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\")\n\nOriginal: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Formal: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" (replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\", more formal)\n\nOriginal: \"I got what you said.\" → Formal: \"I understood you.\" (replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\", more concise and formal)\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original sentence. The key elements are:\n\n- Using more formal verbs or phrases (e.g., \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\")\n- Replacing contractions with full forms (\"I look forward\" vs. \"I look forward to\")\n- Adding more descriptive or polite language (\"Your assistance is much appreciated\" vs. \"Thanks\")\n- Using more formal synonyms (tolerate vs. can't stand)\n- Making the sentences more complete or structured\n\nBut wait, the fifth example is \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, the output is shorter but more formal. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase into a more formal version, possibly expanding or using more precise language.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly using more indirect or elevated language. For example, turning requests into offers (\"Do you want me...\") into \"Shall I...\", which is a more polite way to offer help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more positive or affirmative response. For instance, the first input is a neutral statement, and the output is a positive one. The third input is a thanks, and the output is a more elaborate expression of gratitude. The fourth input is a complaint, and the output is a more formal way of expressing the same sentiment.\n\nBut the fourth example is a complaint, and the output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" That's a direct synonym but in a more formal tone. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, regardless of the original tone.\n\nPutting this all together, the most likely instruction is: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original sentence.\" This would explain all the transformations observed. Each output is a more formal version of the input, sometimes expanding phrases, replacing contractions, using more precise vocabulary, or altering sentence structure for politeness.\n\nLet me verify this against each example:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a more formal and positive rephrasing.\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Uses \"shall\" for politeness and \"accompany\" instead of \"go with.\"\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Adds detail and formality.\n4. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Replaces informal \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" more formal.\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Shorter but more formal.\n\nYes, this fits. The instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version. Therefore, the instruction the friend followed was likely something along the lines of \"Convert each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original sentence.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original sentence**. This involved transforming casual or direct expressions into more refined language through several methods:\n\n1. **Formalization of Greetings/Expressions**:  \n   - \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n   - Example: Substituting informal \"see you\" with a more positive, formal phrase.\n\n2. **Polite Requests/Offerings**:  \n   - \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n   - Example: Replacing \"want me...\" with \"shall I...\" for politeness.\n\n3. **Expanded Gratitude**:  \n   - \"Thanks for your help.\""

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n2. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n5. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard English version? Let's check each pair.\n\nFirst pair: The input is a question phrased as a request. The output is a more polite rephrasing using \"Would you be able to...\" instead of \"Can you do...\". So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into more formal statements or requests.\n\nSecond pair: \"Looks like\" is colloquial; the output uses \"resembles,\" which is more formal. So perhaps replacing informal expressions with more standard ones.\n\nThird pair: \"Got what you said\" is informal. The output uses \"understood you,\" which is a more direct and formal way of expressing comprehension.\n\nFourth pair: The input uses \"I think that...\" while the output starts with \"It is my opinion that...\" This seems like converting first-person opinions into a more formal, third-person phrasing. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase opinions into a more formal structure.\n\nFifth pair: \"Whole\" vs. \"entire.\" The input uses \"whole,\" but the output uses \"entire,\" which is the more standard adjective form. So perhaps replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" when it's used as an adjective.\n\nWait, but in the fifth input, \"The whole story was made up,\" the output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is correct because \"whole\" can sometimes be replaced with \"entire\" depending on context. But maybe the instruction was to replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" in such cases.\n\nPutting this together, possible instruction could be: \"Replace informal or colloquial expressions with their more standard equivalents.\" Or maybe \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and grammatically correct version.\"\n\nBut let's check each example against that hypothesis.\n\nFirst input: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – replacing \"can\" with a more formal expression. That fits.\n\nSecond: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" – replacing informal with standard.\n\nThird: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" – replacing informal phrasing with a clearer statement.\n\nFourth: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" – changing perspective from first person to a more formal \"it is my opinion.\"\n\nFifth: \"whole\" → \"entire\" – replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" where appropriate.\n\nSo the instruction might have been something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal and grammatically precise version by replacing informal expressions with their standard equivalents.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or professional tone. For example, turning questions into more formal requests, replacing contractions with full forms, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some changes are about verb tenses or structures. For example, the fourth input uses \"is\" (present simple), and the output uses \"is\" as well. Not sure. The third input uses past tense \"got,\" output is present \"understood.\" Hmm, not a consistent change in tense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more concise or direct form. For instance, \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which is a more direct way of stating an opinion without the \"I think\" filter.\n\nAnother thought: the first input is a question, and the output is a rephrased question. The second input is a statement, output is a rephrased statement. Third is a statement, output is a rephrased statement. Fourth is a statement, output is a rephrased statement. Fifth is a statement, output is a rephrased statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version, possibly adjusting grammar, vocabulary, or sentence structure.\n\nWait, the first output is a rephrased question, but the input was also a question. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase any question into a more formal version, and any statement into a more formal version. But the second input is a statement, output is a rephrased statement. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, regardless of whether it was a question or statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite or indirect form. For example, changing direct questions into more polite requests, or using \"could\" instead of \"can,\" etc.\n\nLooking back at the first pair: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – both are questions, but the output is phrased as a request rather than a yes/no question. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase any question into a more formal request, possibly changing the structure.\n\nThe second pair: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, \"resembles\" is more formal than \"looks like,\" which is more colloquial. So replacing informal expressions with more standard ones.\n\nThird pair: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, the output is a more direct statement of understanding, whereas the input is phrased as having received the information. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase in a more direct manner.\n\nFourth pair: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" This changes the perspective from first-person to a more objective stance, which is a common way to present opinions formally.\n\nFifth pair: \"whole\" → \"entire.\" As mentioned earlier, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" when it's used as an adjective. For example, \"the whole story\" vs. \"the entire story.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" in such contexts.\n\nPutting all these observations together, the most likely instruction is: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and standard version by replacing informal expressions, adjusting sentence structure, and improving grammar where necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been more specific, like \"Convert each input into a more polite and professional tone by rephrasing questions into requests and adjusting vocabulary.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if all the examples fit this instruction.\n\n1. Question → Formal request: Yes, replacing \"can\" with \"would you be able to...\" makes it more polite and formal.\n2. Colloquial \"looks like\" → Formal \"resembles\": Correct.\n3. Informal \"got what you said\" → Direct \"understood you\": More straightforward.\n4. First-person opinion → Third-person opinion phrasing: Yes, making it more formal.\n5. \"whole\" → \"entire\": Correct replacement here.\n\nAll examples seem to fit this general instruction. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal and standard English version, replacing informal expressions, adjusting sentence structures, and improving grammar as needed.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and standard version** by replacing informal expressions, adjusting sentence structures, and improving grammar where necessary. This involved converting questions into polite requests, replacing colloquial terms with their standard equivalents, restructuring opinions for clarity, and refining vocabulary for precision. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal and grammatically precise version by replacing informal expressions and adjusting sentence structures.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. My job is to determine the common rule or transformation that applies to all these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n5. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nLooking at these, I notice that in some cases, the output is a more formal or slightly different phrasing. Let's break them down:\n\n1. The first input uses \"see you\" which is informal, and the output uses \"look forward to meeting,\" which is a more polite or formal way to express the same idea.\n2. The second input uses \"can't stand,\" which is informal, and the output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal.\n3. The third input uses \"think that,\" and the output replaces it with \"it is my opinion that,\" which is a more formal structure.\n4. The fourth input uses \"whole story\" and \"made up,\" which is informal, and the output uses \"entire story\" and \"fabricated,\" which is more precise and maybe formal.\n5. The fifth input uses \"looks like,\" which is informal, and the output uses \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal or specific.\n\nSo, the instruction might be asking the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version. But wait, let me check if that's consistent across all examples.\n\nWait, the first example's input is \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" That's a common way to respond formally to someone saying they'll see you later. So maybe the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more formal ones, or perhaps to rephrase in a certain style.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with synonyms or more formal equivalents. Let's check each pair:\n\n1. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting\" – replacing the informal expression with a more formal one.\n2. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – replacing the informal \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and changing \"stand\" to \"tolerate.\"\n3. \"think that\" → \"it is my opinion that\" – restructuring the sentence to use a more formal phrasing.\n4. \"whole story\" → \"entire story\" – replacing \"whole\" with \"entire,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal.\n   \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – replacing \"made up\" (which can mean both fabricated and composed) with \"fabricated,\" which is more precise in this context.\n5. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" – replacing the informal \"looks like\" with the synonym \"resembles.\"\n\nSo, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, possibly by replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, restructuring sentences, or using synonyms. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more polite or professional tone.\n\nBut let's consider other possibilities. For example, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a passive voice? Let's check:\n\n1. Original: \"See you tonight.\" Passive would be \"You will be seen tonight.\" But the output is about looking forward, not passive.\n2. \"I can't stand his temper.\" Passive would be \"His temper is stood by me.\" Doesn't match the output.\n3. \"I think that...\" → passive would be \"That is thought by me...\" Not matching.\n4. \"The whole story was made up.\" Passive is \"The story was made up by someone.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Fabricated is a synonym but not passive.\n5. \"She looks like her sister.\" Passive would be \"Her sister is looked like by her.\" Doesn't fit.\n\nSo passive voice isn't the case here.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction is to rephrase into a different sentence structure. For example, the third input becomes \"It is my opinion...\" which is a different structure. The first input becomes a statement of anticipation instead of a greeting. The second input changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a change in verb form and phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the output more assertive or less tentative. For example, \"I can't stand...\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate...\" which is a stronger statement. Similarly, \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which is more assertive.\n\nLooking at the fifth example: \"She looks like her sister.\" The output is \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like,\" but perhaps more formal or precise.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version, possibly by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, restructuring sentences, or using synonyms that convey the same meaning but in a more standard or professional tone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a different type of sentence, such as a question or command, but none of the outputs seem to fit that. For example, the first input is a greeting, and the output is a response. The second is a complaint, output is a similar complaint but phrased differently. Third is a personal opinion, output is a restatement. Fourth is a statement of fact, output is another fact. Fifth is a comparison, output is a synonym.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction could be to translate the input into a more neutral or objective tone. For example, \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is more objective. Similarly, \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which is a more formal way to state an opinion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more positive or less negative tone. For example, \"I can't stand his temper\" is negative, and the output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is also negative but perhaps more direct. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the first example: \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common way to respond to someone who says they'll see you later, turning it into a more positive or anticipatory statement. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase greetings or farewells into more positive or formal expressions.\n\nBut then why does the second example involve changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\"? That's more about changing the verb form and phrasing rather than just greeting.\n\nHmm. Let's think about possible instructions that could cover all these cases.\n\nPossible instruction ideas:\n\n1. Convert informal expressions to formal ones.\n2. Rephrase each input into a more polite or professional tone.\n3. Replace certain words with their synonyms to make the output more precise or standard.\n4. Restructure sentences to improve clarity or formality.\n5. Translate the input into a different sentence structure while maintaining the same meaning.\n\nLet's test these hypotheses against the examples.\n\nFor example, the first input-output pair fits well with hypothesis 1: \"See you\" is informal, replaced with a formal phrase. Hypothesis 2: \"See you\" is a greeting, and the output is a more positive response. Hypothesis 3: \"see\" is replaced with \"look forward to,\" which is a synonym but more formal. Hypothesis 4: The sentence structure is changed from a simple statement to a more elaborate one. Hypothesis 5: The input is a greeting, output is a response.\n\nBut how do the other examples fit?\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't stand\" is informal, and \"tolerate\" is a synonym but more formal. So this fits hypothesis 1 and 3.\n\nThird input: \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" This is a restructuring of the sentence to use a more formal phrasing. So hypothesis 4 and 2 (more formal).\n\nFourth input: \"whole story\" → \"entire story,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\" These are synonyms but more precise. So hypothesis 3.\n\nFifth input: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\" Synonym replacement. Hypothesis 3.\n\nSo multiple hypotheses could apply. But the key is to find the most encompassing instruction that covers all examples.\n\nAnother angle: All outputs seem to be rephrased versions that maintain the same meaning but use different wording. The instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, possibly by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, restructuring sentences, or using synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a different language and back, but that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nWait, looking at the first example: \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common response when someone says \"See you later,\" expressing anticipation rather than just confirming the meeting.

Hmm, looking at each pair, there seems to be a pattern where the original sentence is being rephrased in some way. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nFirst input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\" That makes sense because they're synonyms. Similarly, the second input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Again, \"can't tell\" is rephrased as \"find it hard to,\" which are similar in meaning. Third input: \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" Those are synonyms. Fourth: \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles.\" Fifth: \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you.\" So \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" but the structure changes slightly. Wait, the original is \"I got what you said\" vs. \"I understood you.\" So the first part is changed from \"got\" to \"understood,\" but the second part is \"what you said\" vs. \"you.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms while adjusting the sentence structure accordingly?\n\nBut wait, let's check if all these transformations fit a single rule. For example, in the first case, \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" The structure here is changing \"can't + verb\" to \"cannot + verb.\" But in the second input, \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Here, the structure is different. So maybe the instruction isn't just replacing \"can't\" with another phrase. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the original sentence into a more formal version, using more formal vocabulary. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Formal version: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" That fits. Second input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Also more formal. Third: \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\" Fourth: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\" Fifth: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" So in the fifth case, the structure changes from \"I [verb] what you said\" to \"I [verb] you.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard English version, possibly using synonyms and adjusting the sentence structure when necessary.\n\nLooking at all examples, the key seems to be replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents. Let's verify each transformation:\n\n1. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym replacement)\n2. \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (synonym replacement with slight restructuring)\n3. \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (synonym)\n4. \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym)\n5. \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" (replacing \"got\" with \"understood,\" but removing \"what you said\" and just keeping \"you\")\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal version using synonyms and appropriate sentence structure adjustments.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or standard form, avoiding contractions. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: \"I can't stand...\" → \"I cannot tolerate...\" (removing contraction)\nOriginal: \"I can't tell...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" (changing \"can't tell\" to a longer phrase)\nOriginal: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (synonym)\nOriginal: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym)\nOriginal: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" (changing \"got\" to \"understood,\" and removing \"what you said\" as it's redundant)\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more concise or eliminate filler words. For example, \"I can't tell the difference\" could be rephrased as \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is more formal. Similarly, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a direct synonym without the filler \"what you said.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to replace certain verbs with their base forms or more precise synonyms. For instance, \"stand\" is replaced with \"tolerate,\" \"tell\" with \"distinguish,\" etc.\n\nWait, but in the third example, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym. The fourth example uses \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like,\" which is a more formal synonym. The fifth example replaces \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is a synonym, and removes \"what you said\" because it's redundant.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely tells the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, using synonyms and adjusting the sentence structure as needed. The key is to avoid contractions, use more formal vocabulary, and sometimes remove unnecessary phrases.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This fits the formalization and synonym replacement.\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Again, formalizing and using a synonym phrase.\n3. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Synonym replacement.\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Synonym replacement.\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and \"what you said\" is removed. This seems to fit the instruction of making it more concise and formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal language, replacing informal expressions with their synonyms and adjusting the structure as necessary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal version** using synonyms and appropriate sentence structure adjustments. Specifically, the task involved:\n\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** with their formal counterparts (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. **Adjusting sentence structure** to enhance clarity or conciseness (e.g., removing filler phrases like \"what you said\" in the fifth example).\n3. **Using synonyms** for key terms (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"looks like\" → \"resembles\").\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that each output aligns with standard English conventions, avoiding contractions and unnecessary redundancies while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"I got what you said.\" and the output is \"I understood you.\" So here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\". Let me check the other examples. Second input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Here, \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". Third input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" The structure changes from a question using \"want\" to a suggestion using \"shall\" and \"accompany\". Fourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Whole\" becomes \"entire\", \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". Fifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" \"Once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\".\n\nSo, looking at these transformations, maybe the instruction involves replacing certain words or phrases with synonyms or rephrasing in a different structure. Let's break it down:\n\n1. For verbs like \"got\" (past tense) -> \"understood\" (past tense). But wait, \"got\" is a past participle here, but \"understood\" is also past tense. Maybe it's about converting \"get\" into \"understand\"? Wait, the original input uses \"got what you said,\" which is \"got\" as a past participle. The output uses \"understood,\" which is the base form. So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"got\" with \"understand\" in some way? Or maybe it's a synonym replacement where \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\" in terms of meaning. But \"got\" can mean received, whereas \"understood\" is comprehension. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to express understanding instead of receiving information.\n\nSecond example: \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". Both are about similarity, so synonym replacement.\n\nThird example: The question structure is changed. Original: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the instruction might involve changing the interrogative structure from \"do you want...\" to a more formal \"shall I...\" and changing the verb \"go\" to \"accompany\".\n\nFourth example: \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\". These are synonyms. \"Made up\" can mean composed of parts, but in this context, it's about being fabricated. So replacing those words with their synonyms.\n\nFifth example: \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". So the phrase is rephrased using a synonym phrase.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction seems to be to rephrase each input into a more formal or slightly different version. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first four examples, the main transformations are:\n\n- Changing \"got\" to \"understood\" (maybe rephrasing to express understanding)\n- \"looks like\" to \"resembles\" (synonym)\n- \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" (changing the question structure to a more formal offer)\n- \"whole\" to \"entire\", \"made up\" to \"fabricated\" (synonyms)\n- \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\" (synonym phrase)\n\nWait, but the fifth example's input is a command, not a question. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version. Let's check the outputs:\n\nOriginal 1: Statement expressing understanding. Output is same but with a synonym.\n\nOriginal 2: Statement of similarity. Output uses a synonym.\n\nOriginal 3: Question asking for accompaniment. Output is a suggestion using \"shall\" and \"accompany\".\n\nOriginal 4: Statement about the story being made up. Output uses synonyms.\n\nOriginal 5: Request to call when arriving. Output uses a synonym phrase.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or slightly different version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing structures. But how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonyms or rephrase in a more formal tone. Let's see:\n\nFor the first input, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\". Maybe the instruction is to replace \"got\" with \"understood\" when it's used in the sense of comprehension. But \"got\" can also mean received, so maybe the context matters. However, in the given input, \"got what you said\" implies understanding, so replacing with \"understood\" makes sense.\n\nIn the second example, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". Both are about similarity, so synonym replacement.\n\nThird example: The question is transformed into a suggestion. The instruction might be to turn requests into offers or suggestions using \"shall\" and changing the verb.\n\nFourth example: Synonym replacement of \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nFifth example: Phrase \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing certain phrases. Alternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a more polite or slightly different expression.\n\nBut how to formulate this as a single instruction? Let's think about possible instructions that could lead to these outputs.\n\nPossible instruction ideas:\n\n1. Replace \"got\" with \"understood\" when expressing comprehension.\n2. Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n3. Convert questions starting with \"Do you want...\" into offers using \"Shall I...\" and change the verb to \"accompany\".\n4. Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n5. Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n\nBut these are specific replacements. However, the instruction might be more general. For example, the instruction could be to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing certain structures.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more polite or slightly different phrasing. For example, turning requests into offers, using synonyms for certain words, etc.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or slightly more indirect. For example, \"Shall I accompany you?\" is a more polite way to ask for accompaniment than \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Similarly, \"Please call upon your arrival\" is a more formal way to say \"Please call once you get there.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing certain phrases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to replace certain words with their synonyms or rephrase in a different structure. For example, replacing \"got\" with \"understood\" (synonym), \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" (synonym), changing the question structure to a suggestion (\"shall I...\"), replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" (synonym), and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (synonym), and \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" (synonym phrase).\n\nIf we can find a common rule that applies to all these transformations, that would be the instruction. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all the examples, the key seems to be replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms or rephrasing in a more formal tone. However, the fifth example is a command, not a question, so the structure change there is different. The third example is a question turned into a suggestion.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing certain structures. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"got\" with \"understood\", \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", \"want\" with \"accompany\" in the question, \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", and \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". But that's specific to each case.\n\nWait, but the third example's input is a question, and the output is a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to turn questions into offers or suggestions. For example, changing \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" and then changing the verb accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth example is a request, and the output is a more formal version. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing certain phrases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and phrases. For example:\n\n- Replace \"got\" with \"understood\"\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\"\n- Replace \"want\" with \"accompany\" in the question structure\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\"\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\"\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\"\n\nBut this seems too specific. However, the instruction might be more general. For instance, the instruction could be to rephrase the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms or rephrasing in a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a specific output. Let me look at them one by one and see if I can spot a pattern or common rule.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". That sounds like replacing \"once you get there\" with a more formal or elevated phrasing. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase informal expressions into more polite or standard English?\n\nSecond input:\nI think that this is interesting.\nOutput: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\nAh, here the output starts with \"It is my opinion...\" which is a more formal way of expressing someone's thoughts. So maybe the instruction is to convert first-person statements into third-person opinions or formal expressions?\n\nThird input:\nThe whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\nHere, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing certain words with their synonyms or more formal terms?\n\nFourth input:\nI can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\nAgain, changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe replacing informal verb phrases with more formal ones?\n\nFifth input:\nWe don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\nOutput: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\nThis one is a bit different. The original is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output is a suggestion to not take action. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations?\n\nPutting all these together, each input is being transformed in a way that makes it more formal, polite, or uses more elevated language. Let's check each transformation again:\n\n1. Informal time reference (\"once you get there\") → formal event phrase (\"upon your arrival\").\n2. First-person opinion → third-person opinion phrased formally.\n3. Common adjectives/verbs → more formal synonyms (whole vs. entire, made up vs. fabricated).\n4. Informal verb phrase (\"can't stand\") → formal synonym (\"cannot tolerate\").\n5. Negative statement → positive suggestion (\"no action should be taken\" instead of \"don't think it's a good idea\").\n\nSo the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the sentence. Each output is a more formal or polite version of the input. Therefore, the original instruction probably said something like \"Please rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version of the sentence.\"\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other possible instruction. For example, could it be about converting reported speech? Let's check the outputs again. The first output doesn't seem like reported speech. The second one is a direct quote but phrased as an opinion. Third is a synonym replacement. Fourth is a synonym replacement. Fifth is turning a negative into a suggestion. So no, it's not about reported speech. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction was to translate into another language and back, but the outputs don't seem translated. Alternatively, maybe it's about making the sentences more professional or academic. Yes, that fits. So the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. That would explain all the transformations. Let me confirm each example:\n\n1. \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\": formal event expression.\n2. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\": more formal.\n3. \"Made up\" → \"Fabricated\": more formal.\n4. \"Can't stand\" → \"Cannot tolerate\": more formal.\n5. \"Don't think it's a good idea\" → \"Suggested no action\": rephrased as a recommendation.\n\nYes, all these fit the pattern of making the language more formal or polite. So the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version** of the sentence. This involved transforming informal expressions, first-person opinions, and casual verb phrases into more elevated or professional language. Here's how each input aligns with this instruction:\n\n1. **Input**: Please call once you get there.  \n   **Output**: Please call upon your arrival.  \n   *Formalized the time reference from \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\"*\n\n2. **Input**: I think that this is interesting.  \n   **Output**: It is my opinion that this is interesting.  \n   *Rephrased the first-person statement into a formal third-person opinion.*\n\n3. **Input**: The whole story was made up.  \n   **Output**: The entire story was fabricated.  \n   *Replaced informal \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" for formality.*\n\n4. **Input**: I can't stand his temper.  \n   **Output**: I cannot tolerate his temper.  \n   *Substituted the informal \"can't stand\" with the more formal \"cannot tolerate.\"*\n\n5. **Input**: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.  \n   **Output**: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.  \n   *Rephrased the negative statement into a polite suggestion (\"no action should be taken\" instead of \"don’t think it’s a good idea\").*\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version** of the sentence.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at the examples, each input has a corresponding output that seems to be a rephrased version with some changes. Let me break down each pair to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nWait, here the output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". So maybe the instruction is to add a relative pronoun like \"whom\" when referring to people? But wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the past tense, but the output uses \"whom\" which is more formal. Maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more formal by replacing certain phrases or adding formal language elements.\n\nLooking at the second pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nHere, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" That's a common formal expression. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\nSo here, the entire phrase \"got what you said\" is replaced with \"understood you.\" Maybe the instruction is to rephrase affirmative statements into more concise or different phrasing.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nThe output replaces the informal slang \"fire\" with a more descriptive and formal adjective. So maybe the instruction is to translate informal slang into more standard or positive adjectives.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nHere, the output uses more complex phrasing with \"find it hard to\" instead of \"can't tell,\" and \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference.\" So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into more polite or formal alternatives.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite version by replacing informal expressions, adding relative clauses where appropriate, using more formal verbs or phrases, and rephrasing negative statements into more diplomatic terms.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if all the examples fit this. For instance, the first example adds \"whom,\" which is part of making it more formal. The second uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" Third, replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood you.\" Fourth, replacing \"is fire\" with \"is incredibly good.\" Fifth, changing \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nAnother possible angle: maybe the instruction is to use more specific or precise vocabulary. For example, \"helpful\" remains the same, but \"incredibly good\" is a more detailed adjective. Similarly, \"distinguish\" is more precise than \"tell the difference.\"\n\nAlternatively, could it be about transforming reported speech or indirect vs direct? Not sure. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: look for common transformations. For example, the first output adds \"whom,\" which is a relative pronoun. The second uses \"upon your arrival\" (a formal prepositional phrase). Third, shortens the sentence structure. Fourth, replaces slang with a synonym. Fifth, rephrases the negative into a less direct statement.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction likely involves converting the input into a more formal, polite, and precise version by making several types of changes: adding formal relative clauses, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, rephrasing negative statements into softer terms, and using more descriptive adjectives instead of slang.\n\nTherefore, the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal and polite by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adding relative clauses where appropriate, rephrasing negative statements into softer terms, and using more precise and descriptive language instead of slang.\"\n\nBut let me verify if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to use a specific translation method, like replacing certain words. But in the first example, \"was helpful\" stays the same. The second example replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\" Third, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you.\" Fourth, \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good.\" Fifth, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a thesaurus replacement. For example, replacing \"helpful\" with \"incredibly good\" (though that's not a direct thesaurus entry), but \"fire\" is slang for \"good,\" so replacing slang with a synonym. However, the third example is replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood you,\" which isn't a direct synonym but a more concise form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a passive voice? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" No change in voice. Second input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Still active voice. Third: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Passive vs active? Original is active (\"got\"), output is active (\"understood\"). Fourth: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" No change in voice. Fifth: \"I can't tell the difference...\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Still active voice. So passive voice isn't the case here.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause. First example adds \"whom,\" second example doesn't have a relative clause. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more complex by adding more clauses. But the first example adds a relative clause, others don't. So that's not the main pattern.\n\nLooking back at the examples, the key changes seem to be:\n\n1. Formality: replacing informal with formal.\n2. Precision: replacing vague with more specific terms.\n3. Politeness: rephrasing negative statements into softer terms.\n4. Slang to standard: replacing slang with more standard adjectives.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction is likely to rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, and precise version by making these kinds of transformations. Therefore, the instruction could be phrased as: \"Convert each sentence into a more formal and polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adding relative clauses where appropriate, rephrasing negative statements into softer terms, and using more precise and descriptive language instead of slang.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and precise version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Formalize Language**: Replace informal expressions with their more formal counterparts (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\").\n2. **Enhance Precision**: Use more specific or descriptive terms (e.g., \"incredibly good\" instead of \"fire\").\n3. **Soften Negative Statements**: Rephrase negative or blunt statements into softer, more diplomatic terms (e.g., \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\").\n4. **Add Relative Clauses**: Incorporate formal relative pronouns or clauses where appropriate (e.g., \"whom I met\" in the first example).\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each sentence to make it more formal and polite by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adding relative clauses where appropriate, rephrasing negative statements into softer terms, and using more precise and descriptive language instead of slang.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input has a corresponding output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the relationship between each input and its output. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" \nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nWait, the output seems like a more formal or polite way of responding. Instead of directly saying \"see you,\" the output uses \"look forward to meeting,\" which is a common phrase used in more formal contexts. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal tone?\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nHere, the output is phrased using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\" That's another example of making the statement more formal or indirect. So perhaps the instruction is to convert direct statements into more indirect or formal expressions?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. The input is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output is a suggestion to not take action. The structure here changes the perspective from a group's lack of agreement to a suggestion. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations?\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\n\nHere, the output is a more concise version. The original is a bit informal (\"got what you said\"), and the output simplifies it to \"I understood you.\" So perhaps the instruction is to make the response more concise or professional?\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nAgain, a change in vocabulary. \"Can't stand\" is colloquial, while \"cannot tolerate\" is more formal. So this might be part of the same pattern as the first example—replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nPutting all these together, there seem to be multiple patterns. Let's list possible instruction types:\n\n1. Formalizing language: Converting informal expressions to more formal or polite phrasing (like replacing \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting\").\n2. Reducing directness: Changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\" (less direct).\n3. Rephrasing negative statements into suggestions (e.g., not thinking it's a good idea becomes suggesting no action).\n4. Making responses more concise (e.g., \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\").\n5. Replacing informal idioms with more formal terms (can't stand vs. cannot tolerate).\n\nBut wait, some of these might overlap. For instance, the first example could be both formalizing and reducing directness. However, the third example specifically changes a negative statement into a suggestion, which might be a separate rule.\n\nNow, considering all these possibilities, the instruction likely requires transforming the input into a more formal or professional response. But which specific transformation rules apply here?\n\nLet's check each input-output again with this hypothesis:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This fits formalizing and reducing directness.\n2. Input: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\" → formalizing and indirect phrasing.\n3. Input: \"We don't think...\" → Output: \"It is suggested...\" → changing the perspective from a group's opinion to a suggestion.\n4. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" → conciseness.\n5. Input: \"I can't stand...\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate...\" → formalizing vocabulary.\n\nSo, the instruction might involve multiple transformations. However, the third example stands out because it's a structural change rather than just vocabulary substitution. The original is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output is a suggestion to not take action. This suggests that the instruction could be to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations or suggestions.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples? Let's see:\n\n- The first example is a greeting turned into a formal expression.\n- The second is a personal opinion phrased more formally.\n- The fourth is conciseness.\n- The fifth is vocabulary formality.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is a combination of several rules. However, the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction, so maybe all these transformations are part of a single overarching rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, which includes various sub-rules like replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, changing sentence structures, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with \"I\" or \"It is,\" which might indicate that the instruction is to start the output with a subject pronoun or a formal phrase.\n\nWait, let's check the outputs:\n\n1. Starts with \"I\"\n2. Starts with \"It is my opinion\"\n3. Starts with \"It is suggested\"\n4. Starts with \"I\"\n5. Starts with \"I\"\n\nSo some start with \"I,\" others with \"It is.\" Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal structure, possibly starting with \"It is\" or \"I\" depending on the context.\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or formal response, which could involve several steps:\n\n- Replace contractions with full forms (e.g., \"I can't\" → \"I cannot\")\n- Use more formal verbs (e.g., \"stand\" → \"tolerate\")\n- Change sentence structures (e.g., \"We don't think\" → \"It is suggested\")\n- Start with \"I\" or \"It is\" to make it more assertive or formal\n\nBut the third example changes the entire structure from a negative statement to a suggestion. That's a bigger transformation. How to capture that in a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect response, which could include various transformations like those observed.\n\nAnother approach: look for common elements across all outputs. For example, the outputs often use \"I\" or \"It is\" as the subject. The first output starts with \"I,\" the second with \"It is my opinion,\" the third with \"It is suggested,\" the fourth with \"I,\" and the fifth with \"I.\" So maybe the instruction is to start the output with a subject (either \"I\" or \"It is\") followed by a more formal or indirect phrasing.\n\nAdditionally, the outputs tend to avoid first-person pronouns in the input. For example, the first input uses \"you,\" but the output uses \"I look forward to meeting you.\" Wait, the output still uses \"you,\" but in a more formal way. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone without changing the person.\n\nWait, the first input is \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the person is changed from \"you\" to \"me\" (I), but the addressee remains \"you.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect form, possibly changing the perspective from first-person to third-person or vice versa, but keeping the addressee as \"you.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a more formal response by using more polite language, starting with \"I\" or \"It is,\" and avoiding contractions or informal expressions.\n\nBut how to formulate this as a single instruction?\n\nPerhaps the instruction is: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite response, starting with 'I' or 'It is,' and using more formal language where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let's test this against the examples:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This fits, as it's more formal and starts with \"I.\"\n2. Input: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\" → starts with \"It is,\" which is formal.\n3. Input: \"We don't think...\" → Output: \"It is suggested...\" → starts with \"It is suggested,\" which is a formal way to present a recommendation.\n4. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" → starts with \"I,\" more concise.\n5. Input: \"I can't stand...\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate...\" → starts with \"I,\" replaces \"can't\" with \"cannot,\" more formal.\n\nThis seems to cover all examples. The instruction would be to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite response, possibly starting with \"I\" or \"It is,\" and using more formal language where applicable. However, the third example's transformation is more structural, changing the entire sentence from a negative statement to a suggestion. So maybe the instruction includes both linguistic and structural transformations.\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite response, which may involve various transformations like those observed. The key is that the output is a more formal version of the input, possibly starting with \"I\" or \"It is,\" and using more formal language<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to analyze each input-output pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject changed from \"I\" to \"Various,\" and the verb structure changed from past tense \"considered\" to passive voice \"were considered.\" Also, \"many\" became \"various.\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal way, using passive voice and replacing \"many\" with \"various\"?\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is transformed into a more polite form. The original uses \"do,\" but the output uses \"be able to accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into more formal or polite versions, possibly changing verbs and adding \"able to\" or similar phrases.\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" The change here is replacing the possessive pronoun \"I\" with the relative pronoun \"whom.\" So perhaps the instruction was to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses using \"whom\" or \"who\"?\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" The original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction was to turn informal greetings into more formal expressions of looking forward to seeing someone.\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" The original slang term \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good.\" So perhaps the instruction was to translate slang or informal expressions into more standard or positive phrasing.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what could the general instruction be? Let's see:\n\n1. For the first input, passive voice, replacing \"many\" with \"various.\"\n2. For the second, rephrasing questions into more polite forms, possibly using \"be able to\" or similar.\n3. For the third, converting possessive pronouns to relative clauses with \"whom.\"\n4. For the fourth, turning casual greetings into formal expressions of anticipation.\n5. For the fifth, replacing slang with more standard phrasing.\n\nWait, but how do these fit under a single instruction? Let me think again. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, using different grammatical structures and vocabulary. For example:\n\n- Use passive voice where possible.\n- Replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n- Convert possessive pronouns to relative clauses.\n- Turn questions into more polite requests.\n- Anticipate meetings instead of using casual greetings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and style accordingly. Each input-output pair shows a different aspect of formalization. For instance:\n\n- First input: Passive voice, replacing \"many\" with \"various\" (more formal).\n- Second input: Changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\" (more polite).\n- Third input: Using \"whom\" instead of \"I\" (formal relative clause).\n- Fourth input: Changing \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal anticipation).\n- Fifth input: Replacing slang \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (formal praise).\n\nSo the instruction might have been something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or professional version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and style as needed.\" But perhaps more specific. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to perform multiple transformations: passive voice, politeness, relative clauses, anticipation phrasing, and replacing slang.\n\nBut the key is that each output is a different type of transformation. So the instruction could be a combination of several tasks. However, the user might have given a single instruction that encompasses all these changes. For example, \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by applying the following transformations: use passive voice where appropriate, replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents, convert possessive pronouns to relative clauses, rephrase questions into polite requests, and anticipate meetings instead of using casual greetings.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was more general, like \"Polish each input into a more professional tone by making necessary grammatical adjustments and improving clarity.\" But the examples show specific transformations, so the instruction likely specified particular changes.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to follow certain patterns. For example, the first output uses \"various\" instead of \"many,\" which is a quantifier change. The second uses \"be able to\" instead of \"do.\" The third uses \"whom\" instead of \"I.\" The fourth uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you.\" The fifth replaces slang with a more descriptive adjective.\n\nSo the instruction might have been a set of rules or a list of transformations to apply. For example:\n\n1. Replace \"many\" with \"various\" when referring to quantities.\n2. Convert questions starting with \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\" or similar.\n3. Replace possessive pronouns with relative clauses using \"whom\" or \"who.\"\n4. Turn casual greetings like \"See you...\" into expressions of anticipation.\n5. Replace informal slang terms with more formal or positive alternatives.\n\nBut the user probably provided a single instruction that covers all these aspects. Alternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which would involve applying various transformations as needed. For example, the instruction might have been: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal version by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and style as required.\"\n\nHowever, considering that each input-output pair requires a different transformation, the instruction might have been more specific. For example, the instruction could have been: \"For each input, rewrite it using passive voice where applicable, replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents, convert possessive pronouns to relative clauses, rephrase questions into polite requests, and anticipate meetings instead of using casual greetings.\"\n\nBut since the user mentioned that the friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every input, the instruction must have been a set of guidelines or a list of tasks to perform on each input. Given that each output corresponds to a different transformation, the instruction likely included multiple specific instructions, such as:\n\n- Use passive voice whenever possible.\n- Replace \"many\" with \"various.\"\n- Convert questions into more polite forms using \"be able to.\"\n- Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in possessive clauses.\n- Turn casual greetings into expressions of anticipation.\n- Replace slang terms with more formal or positive language.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been a combination of these, such as: \"Apply the following transformations to each input: passive voice, polite questions, relative clauses, anticipation phrasing, and formalizing slang.\"\n\nBut the most precise answer would be that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version by applying specific grammatical and stylistic changes as outlined in the examples. Since each input-output pair shows a different transformation, the instruction likely included multiple steps or rules, but the overall goal was to make the output more formal.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal version** by applying specific transformations as follows:\n\n1. **Passive Voice**: Convert active sentences to passive where appropriate (e.g., \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n2. **Polite Questions**: Restructure \"Can you...\" queries into more formal phrasing (e.g., \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\").\n3. **Relative Clauses**: Replace possessive pronouns with \"whom\" in relative clauses (e.g., \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\").\n4. **Anticipation Phrasing**: Transform casual greetings into expressions of looking forward (e.g., \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight\").\n5. **Formalize Slang**: Replace informal slang with more standard or positive terminology (e.g., \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\").\n\nThe overarching goal was to adjust grammar, vocabulary, and style to enhance formality and clarity.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at the examples, each input has been transformed into a slightly different version. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nFirst example: Input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the original sentence uses a non-restrictive relative clause. The input doesn't have a comma, but the output adds \"whom\" to make it more formal or perhaps to clarify the clause. Wait, actually, in the original input, \"I met yesterday\" is a non-restrictive clause because it's not essential to the meaning. But adding \"whom\" might be making it restrictive? Or maybe the instruction is about converting the relative pronoun from \"that\" or \"who\" to \"whom\"? Wait, the original doesn't use \"who\" or \"that\", so maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" when the clause is non-restrictive? But the original doesn't have any relative pronoun. Wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no relative clause there. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. Oh, wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is noun phrase + relative clause. The relative clause here is \"I met yesterday,\" which is a non-restrictive clause because it's not essential. But in the output, they added \"whom\" to the relative clause. Wait, the original input doesn't have a relative pronoun. Wait, maybe the input was supposed to have a relative clause but was mistyped? Or perhaps the instruction is to convert the relative pronoun from \"that\" or \"who\" to \"whom\"? But the input doesn't have any relative pronoun. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to look at other examples to see a pattern.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Here, the output is more formal, using \"find it hard to\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\". Also, \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase common phrases into more formal equivalents. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, or using synonyms for certain verbs.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the question is being rephrased from a first-person request to a third-person offer. The original is \"Do you want me...\" which is asking if the speaker should go. The output is \"Shall I...\", which is offering to go. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into offers or suggestions, changing the perspective from second person to first person.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the output changes \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\". So \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object is changed from \"what you said\" to \"you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase common phrases into more direct or concise expressions.\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, the informal slang \"fire\" is replaced with a more formal synonym. So the instruction might involve replacing informal expressions with more standard phrasing.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction seems to be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version, possibly by replacing colloquialisms, adjusting sentence structure, using more formal verb tenses or phrasing, and rephrasing common expressions into their more standard equivalents. Let's check if this holds for all examples.\n\nFirst example: The input is a simple statement. The output adds \"whom\" to the relative clause. But wait, the original input doesn't have a relative clause. Wait, maybe the input was supposed to have a relative clause but was mistyped? Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" when the clause is non-restrictive. But the original input doesn't have a relative pronoun. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the first input and output.\n\nWait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is adding \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". But why would that be necessary? Unless the original sentence was missing a relative pronoun, but as written, it's correct. Maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" to make the relative clause more formal, even though it's not strictly necessary. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the original input had a typo, like \"The lawyer who I met yesterday was helpful,\" but the user wrote it without \"who\". If that's the case, then the instruction is to add \"whom\" to make it grammatically correct. But the original input is correct as is. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the first example isn't part of the pattern. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the relative clause from a non-restrictive to a restrictive one by adding \"whom\". But in the original input, the clause \"I met yesterday\" is non-restrictive because it's not essential. Adding \"whom\" might make it restrictive, but that's not necessarily incorrect. However, the output is still grammatically correct either way. So maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" to the relative clause to make it more formal, even if it's not strictly necessary. But why would that be the case? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more formal version, which could include adding \"whom\" in such cases.\n\nBut then, looking at the second example, where the output is more formal, that fits with the idea of making the language more standard. The third example also fits, as it's rephrasing a question into a suggestion. The fourth example replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\", which is a more direct expression. The fifth example replaces slang with a more formal term.\n\nSo perhaps the overall instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version of the sentence, using more appropriate vocabulary, grammar, and structure. That would explain all the examples. Let's test this hypothesis against each input-output pair.\n\nFirst input: The output adds \"whom\" to the relative clause. If the instruction is to make the language more formal, adding \"whom\" here might be part of that process, even if it's not strictly necessary. Alternatively, maybe the original input was missing a relative pronoun, and the instruction is to add it. But since the original is correct, perhaps the instruction is to add \"whom\" to make it more formal. However, the original is already correct, so maybe this is an exception. Alternatively, maybe the first example is not part of the pattern, and the rest fit the instruction.\n\nSecond example: The output uses more formal phrasing (\"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\"), which aligns with the instruction.\n\nThird example: The question is rephrased into a suggestion (\"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want me to go with you?\"), which fits the instruction of rephrasing into a more formal or standard form.\n\nFourth example: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct and formal way of expressing understanding.\n\nFifth example: \"This song is fire\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good,\" replacing slang with a more standard adjective.\n\nSo, considering all examples, the instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal or standard version of the sentence, possibly by replacing colloquialisms, adjusting sentence structure, using more formal verb tenses or phrasing, and rephrasing common expressions into their more standard equivalents. The first example might be an exception where the addition of \"whom\" is part of making the sentence more formal, even if the original was correct. Alternatively, maybe the first input had a typo, and the instruction is to add \"whom\" to correct it, but since the original is correct, perhaps that's not the case. However, given the other examples, the most consistent instruction is to rephrase into a more formal version.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version**, focusing on several key transformations:\n1. **Replacing colloquialisms**: Convert informal expressions (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n2. **Adjusting phrasing**: Use more formal alternatives (e.g., \"find it hard to distinguish\" vs. \"can't tell the difference\").\n3. **Rephrasing questions**: Transform requests into offers or suggestions (e.g., \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n4. **Simplifying structures**: Streamline sentences for clarity (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version of the sentence, often by replacing informal language, adjusting phrasing, and restructuring clauses for clarity.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nWait, so the output is replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and changing \"stand\" to \"tolerate\". But why? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using synonyms. Let's check another pair to see if this holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the output changes \"considered\" to \"were considered\" and adds \"various\" before approaches. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into passive voice and add descriptive adjectives where possible. Let's check the third pair.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like a completely different structure. The original is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea to do anything, but the output is a suggestion to take no action. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a positive suggestion, possibly using formal language. That makes sense. The output is more formal and uses \"it is suggested\" instead of a direct statement.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the output replaces the relative pronoun \"I\" with \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to convert the relative pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\" in cases where it refers to the subject. But wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. However, the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. Wait, that might not make sense. Unless the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of a preposition. Let me check the original input. The original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom\". That seems odd unless there's a preposition involved. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why does the output have \"whom\"? That doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts, but that doesn't align with the output here. Hmm, maybe this pair isn't following the same rule as the others. Let me hold onto that thought and check the fifth pair.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHere, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So again, synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms. But then why does the fourth pair involve changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? That seems inconsistent. Unless the instruction was more complex, combining multiple transformations.\n\nWait, looking back at the fourth pair: the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\". But in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. However, the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. This suggests that perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition. But in this case, there's no preposition. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition that I missed. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" No preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the input-output pair, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the context. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use the objective case whenever possible, regardless of the preposition. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that would change the meaning. For example, \"I met\" becomes \"me met\", which is grammatically incorrect. So that can't be right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a question, but the outputs don't look like questions. Let's see. First output is a statement, second is a statement, third is a suggestion, fourth is a statement, fifth is a statement. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common transformations. Let's list the changes:\n\n1. Input: \"can't stand\" → Output: \"cannot tolerate\"\n   - Synonym replacement: \"can't\" vs \"cannot\", \"stand\" vs \"tolerate\"\n\n2. Input: \"considered many approaches\" → Output: \"various approaches were considered\"\n   - Passive voice conversion (\"considered\" → \"were considered\") and addition of \"various\"\n\n3. Input: \"don't think it's a good idea to do anything\" → Output: \"it is suggested that no action should be taken\"\n   - Replacing the original statement with a suggestion, changing the structure entirely\n\n4. Input: \"lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → Output: \"lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\"\n   - Changing \"I\" to \"whom\"\n\n5. Input: \"whole story was made up\" → Output: \"entire story was fabricated\"\n   - Synonym replacement: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n\nSo, the first, third, and fifth pairs involve synonym replacement. The second involves passive voice and adjective addition. The fourth involves changing the relative pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\". \n\nNow, the challenge is to find a single instruction that could cover all these transformations. Let's think about possible instructions.\n\nPossibility 1: The instruction was to rephrase each sentence into a more formal or standard version. For example, replacing contractions, changing verb tenses, adding adjectives, etc. But the fourth pair doesn't fit this, as it's about changing the relative pronoun.\n\nPossibility 2: The instruction was to convert each sentence into a different type of sentence structure. For example, the first pair is a contraction to a full form, the second is active to passive, the third is a suggestion, the fourth is changing pronouns, the fifth is synonym replacement. But this seems too vague.\n\nPossibility 3: The instruction was to apply specific transformations based on certain criteria. For example, replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\", changing \"I\" to \"me\" or \"whom\", converting to passive voice, etc. But how?\n\nLooking at the fourth pair again: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". If the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition, but in this case, there's no preposition. Unless the original input had a preposition that was removed. Wait, maybe the input was different. Let me check again. The user provided the input as \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? This is puzzling. Maybe there's a typo in the input-output pair. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that would make the sentence \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful,\" which is grammatically incorrect. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a question, but the outputs don't look like questions. For example, the first output is a statement, not a question. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the possible instruction that could lead to all these outputs. Let's think about possible transformations:\n\n- For the first pair: replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and \"stand\" with \"tolerate\".\n- Second pair: passive voice and adding \"various\".\n- Third pair: rephrasing into a suggestion.\n- Fourth pair: changing \"I\" to \"whom\".\n- Fifth pair: synonym replacement.\n\nHmm. The fourth pair is the only one that involves changing the relative pronoun. So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into a different type of clause, such as turning it into a relative clause with a different pronoun. But why \"whom\" specifically? Unless the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of a verb. Wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective case. That doesn't fit unless there's a preposition involved. Wait, maybe the original input had a preposition that was omitted. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" There's no preposition here. So why the change to \"whom\"? This is confusing. Maybe the input was different. For example, if the input was \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" then<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule from the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n4. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nHmm. Let's analyze each pair. Maybe looking at the verbs first? For example, in the first input, \"see\" becomes \"look forward to meeting\". Wait, but \"see you\" is a greeting, so maybe the output is rephrasing the input in a more formal or polite way. Let's check the second input: \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able...\". That seems like changing the question into a more polite form, using \"would\" instead of \"can\", and adding \"be able to\". The third input changes \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\". So replacing \"can't\" with \"find it hard to\", and changing the verb structure. The fourth input turns \"Thanks\" into \"Your assistance is...\", which is a more formal response. The fifth input changes \"considered\" to \"were considered\", which might be passive voice or rephrasing.\n\nWait, but the fifth input's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the original was active voice (\"I considered\"), and the output is passive (\"Various approaches were considered\"). But the first input's output is active (\"I look forward to meeting\"), so that doesn't fit. So maybe not always passive. Let's see other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able...\". So changing the modal verb \"can\" to \"would be able to\". Third input: \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". Fourth input: \"Thanks\" becomes \"Your assistance is...\". Fifth input: \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\".\n\nLooking for common elements. Let's see:\n\n- The first output starts with \"I look forward to...\", which is a common phrase when someone is anticipating a meeting. The input was a casual greeting. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite response, often used in emails or letters.\n\nSecond input: Changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able...\". This is a more polite way of asking a question, perhaps in a professional context.\n\nThird input: Changing \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\". Both mean the same thing, but phrased differently. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a more formal or academic tone.\n\nFourth input: \"Thanks for your help\" is turned into \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Again, a more formal response, possibly in a business context.\n\nFifth input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb is made passive. So this could be part of a larger text where the focus shifts from the speaker to the subject being discussed.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often used in written communication. Let's check if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst input: \"See you tonight.\" → Formal response. \"I look forward to meeting you...\" is indeed a more formal way to express the same idea.\n\nSecond input: \"Can you...\" → Polite question becomes \"Would you be able...\" which is more formal.\n\nThird input: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" is a more formal phrasing.\n\nFourth input: \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is appreciated\" is a standard formal response.\n\nFifth input: Active to passive voice, which might be part of making the sentence more objective or shifting focus.\n\nBut wait, the fifth input's output is passive, but the first input's output is active. So why the inconsistency? Maybe the instruction isn't strictly about voice, but about rephrasing into a more formal tone, which sometimes involves passive voice but not always.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using different structures like changing questions into polite requests, using more formal vocabulary, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs. For example, \"see\" becomes \"look forward to meeting\", \"do\" becomes \"accomplish\", \"tell the difference\" becomes \"distinguish\", \"help\" becomes \"assistance\", \"considered\" becomes \"were considered\".\n\nSo maybe the instruction involved replacing certain verbs with their more formal counterparts, or restructuring the sentence to make it more polite or formal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by using more elevated language, changing contractions (like \"can't\" to \"find it hard to\"), and adjusting sentence structure for politeness.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nFirst input: \"See you tonight.\" → Formal response. The output uses \"look forward to\", which is a common phrase in formal writing. So replacing \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting\" makes sense as a more formal alternative.\n\nSecond input: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able...\" is a more polite way to ask, which is formal.\n\nThird input: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\". Both mean the same, but the latter is more formal.\n\nFourth input: \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is appreciated\" is a standard formal response.\n\nFifth input: \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\". Here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb is made passive. This could be part of a larger text where the focus is on the approaches rather than the speaker's actions. So the instruction might involve rephrasing the input into a more objective or formal tone, possibly using passive voice when appropriate.\n\nSo putting all this together, the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, often used in written communication, by adjusting sentence structure, using more formal vocabulary, changing questions into polite requests, and sometimes converting active voice to passive voice.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction probably stated something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, suitable for written communication, by adjusting sentence structure, using more formal vocabulary, and changing questions into polite requests where necessary.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, typically used in written communication.

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. Let me start by analyzing each pair one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nSo here, the verb \"looks\" was changed to \"resembles\". Both are synonyms, but maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs with their synonyms? But wait, let's check other pairs to see if this holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the phrase \"I met\" became \"whom I met\". So instead of using the pronoun \"I\", it's replaced with \"whom\". That suggests maybe replacing possessive pronouns with their relative clause forms? Or perhaps changing the structure from a participle phrase to a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nThis seems like a more complex change. The original is a question asking ability (\"Can you...\"), and the output is a rephrased question using \"be able to\" and \"accomplish\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions about capability into more formal or different phrasing, possibly using \"be able to\" and changing the verb structure.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, the slang term \"fire\" was replaced with \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more formal or standard phrasing.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nIn this case, \"whole\" was replaced with \"entire\", and \"made up\" became \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing common phrases or words with their more precise or formal equivalents.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Let's see:\n\n1. Synonym replacement (looks/resembles)\n2. Pronoun to relative clause (I/meet -> whom I met)\n3. Question rephrasing (can -> would be able to)\n4. Slang to formal (fire -> incredibly good)\n5. Common phrases to more precise terms (whole/entire, made up/fabricated)\n\nHmm. It seems like the instruction might involve rephrasing in a way that makes the language more formal, precise, or uses synonyms. But each example uses different strategies. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more polite or formal version. For example, the second input had \"I met\" changed to \"whom I met\", which is more formal. The third input turned a simple question into a more formal \"Would you be able to...\" which is more polite. The fourth input replaced slang with a more descriptive phrase. The fifth input replaced colloquial terms with more precise ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their antonyms or synonyms, but the first example does that. However, the other examples don't fit that pattern. For instance, \"helpful\" becomes \"was helpful\" (same word), \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" (not a synonym). So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more elaborate versions of the inputs. For example, the first output adds \"resembles\" which is a synonym but also a more formal term. The second adds \"whom\" making it more formal. The third turns a simple question into a more formal one. The fourth replaces slang with a more detailed description. The fifth replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", which are more precise.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to make the sentences more formal, precise, or use more elaborate phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a way that uses a specific part of speech or grammatical structure. For example, the second input changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is a relative clause instead of a participle phrase. That could be part of the instruction.\n\nLooking at the third input-output pair: the original is a question, and the output is a rephrased question. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into different structures, like using \"be able to\" or changing the verb form.\n\nThe fourth input-output pair shows replacing slang with more descriptive language. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal or slang terms with more formal or precise alternatives.\n\nThe fifth input-output pair replaces common phrases with more accurate or formal terms. For example, \"whole story\" vs \"entire story\", \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\".\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, or elaborate version. However, each example uses different methods. Let's see if there's a common element.\n\nWait, another thought: the outputs often use more words than the inputs. For example, \"resembles\" vs \"looks like\", adding \"resembles\" which is a synonym but also more formal. The second input added \"whom\" which increases the word count. The third input added \"Would you be able to\" which is longer. The fourth added \"incredibly good\" instead of \"fire\". The fifth added \"entire\" and \"fabricated\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their antonyms or synonyms, but as before, not all examples fit. For instance, \"helpful\" remains the same, \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" (not a synonym), etc.\n\nWait, looking at the first input-output pair again: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"resembles\" is a synonym but also a more formal term. Similarly, \"resembled\" is past tense. So maybe the instruction was to replace verbs with their synonyms, especially more formal ones.\n\nBut then why does the second input change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? That's a different kind of transformation. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input in a way that uses more formal language, but the exact method varies per example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite or formal version. For example, the second input uses \"whom\" which is more formal. The third input uses \"Would you be able to\" which is more polite. The fourth input replaces slang with a more formal description. The fifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", which are more precise.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more specific or precise vocabulary. For example, \"resembles\" is more specific than \"looks like\". \"Whom\" is more specific than \"I met\". \"Would be able to\" is a more formal way to ask for capability. \"Incredibly good\" is a more descriptive alternative to \"fire\". \"Entire\" and \"fabricated\" are more precise than \"whole\" and \"made up\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to replace general or vague terms with more specific, precise, or formal alternatives. Additionally, some examples involve changing the structure of the sentence, like converting a participle phrase to a relative clause.\n\nBut how to reconcile all these changes under a single instruction? Let's consider possible instructions:\n\n1. **Formalize the language**: Replace informal terms with more formal ones, adjust sentence structure for formality, etc.\n2. **Rephrase for clarity**: Use more precise vocabulary, avoid slang, etc.\n3. **Convert to passive voice**: Not sure, but some outputs don't fit that.\n4. **Use more specific synonyms**: As seen in the first example.\n\nBut the second example doesn't fit that. So maybe a combination of multiple transformations. However, the user probably expects a single instruction that encompasses all these changes.\n\nWait, looking back at the outputs, another pattern: the outputs often use more words than the inputs. For example, \"resembles her sister\" vs \"looks like her sister\" (adds \"resembles\"). \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\" vs \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" (adds \"whom\"). \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" vs \"Can you do all these tasks?\" (adds \"Would you be able to\"). \"This song is incredibly good\" vs \"This song is fire\" (adds \"incredibly good\"). \"The entire story was fabricated\" vs \"The whole story was made up\" (adds \"entire\" and removes \"was made up\").\n\nSo the instruction might have been to expand each input into a more detailed or precise version, possibly using more words, more formal language, or more specific terms. But how to phrase that as a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their antonyms or synonyms, but as discussed earlier, not all examples fit. For instance, \"helpful\" remains the same, \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" (not a synonym), etc.\n\nWait, another approach: look for the most common transformation across all examples. Let's see:\n\n- Synonym replacement (first, fourth)\n- Formalizing pronouns (second)\n- Question rephrasing (third)\n- Phrase replacement (fifth)\n- Adding more words (all<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\n\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\n\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. \nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\n\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\nThe instruction was<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<|begin_of_thought|>Okay, let's try to figure out what the original instruction could be based on these input-output pairs. Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nWait, the output seems to have changed the subject-verb order. The original is \"I considered,\" but the output starts with \"Various approaches were considered.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a passive voice? But wait, the second input-output pair might not fit that. Let's check the second pair.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHere, both \"made up\" and \"fabricated\" mean the same thing, but they're synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms? But then the third input-output pair doesn't fit that. Let's see.\n\nThird input-output pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nAh, here the output adds a relative pronoun \"whom\" where the input had \"I met\". So perhaps the instruction was to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses? Or maybe to add a relative pronoun when a noun is mentioned after a possessive? Wait, in the input, it's \"I met yesterday\" which becomes \"whom I met yesterday\". So the output adds \"whom\" before the clause. That suggests changing the possessive pronoun to a relative clause. For example, replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\".\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nAgain, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". So this seems like replacing a phrase with a synonym. But the fifth pair is different.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nHere, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". So again, synonyms. But the first pair was a passive voice change, the second a synonym replacement, third a relative clause addition, fourth synonym replacement, fifth synonym replacement. That's inconsistent. So maybe the instruction isn't uniform across all inputs. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple transformations depending on the input. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, looking back at the first pair: \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject-verb inversion. The original is active voice (I did something), output is passive. But the second input is \"was made up\" which becomes \"was fabricated\", so passive voice again. Third input is \"was helpful\" (passive) becomes \"was helpful\" (same structure?), but the output adds \"whom\". Fourth input \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\" (synonym). Fifth input \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym).\n\nHmm, so the first two outputs are passive voice, the third is adding a relative pronoun, the fourth and fifth are synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to apply different transformations based on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard version. Let's think about each input-output pair:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing from active to passive voice. But why \"various\" instead of just \"approaches\"? Maybe the instruction was to use a more specific adjective. But \"various\" is more specific than \"many\". Wait, \"many\" is plural, \"various\" is also plural. So maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by using a more precise adjective. But that's speculative.\n\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" vs \"entire\" are synonyms, and \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\" are synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to replace common phrases with their synonyms. But \"whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, but \"made up\" and \"fabricated\" are also synonyms. So perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms. But why in some cases it's a synonym replacement and others different transformations?\n\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". This seems like converting a possessive pronoun into a relative clause. So the instruction might have been to turn possessive pronouns into relative clauses when followed by a past participle. For example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\".\n\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Again, replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\". So synonym replacement.\n\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSo the instruction seems to involve multiple possible transformations. But how to unify them? Let's see:\n\nPossibly, the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or standardized version. For example:\n\n- Passive voice conversion (first two inputs)\n- Synonym replacement (third, fourth, fifth)\n- Adding a relative pronoun (third input)\n\nBut that's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to perform different transformations based on the part of speech or structure. For example:\n\n- If the input has a verb in active voice, convert to passive.\n- If the input uses a colloquial phrase (like \"can't stand\"), replace with a more formal equivalent.\n- If the input has a possessive pronoun followed by a past participle, convert to a relative clause.\n\nBut that would require multiple rules. However, the problem states that the friend read the instruction and applied it to each input. So the instruction must be a single set of instructions that covers all these cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms, but only when possible. For example, \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\", \"looks like\" → \"resembles\". But why not \"whole\" → \"entire\"? Maybe because \"whole\" is already a synonym, but \"made up\" is a phrase that needs replacement. Similarly, \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice). So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly using passive voice, synonym replacement, or other transformations.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, the first two are passive voice, the third adds a relative pronoun, the fourth and fifth are synonym replacements. So maybe the instruction was to apply a series of possible transformations, choosing the most appropriate one based on the input. But the user says the friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every input. So the instruction must be a set of rules that can generate the output from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, which could involve multiple steps. For example:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive where possible.\n2. Replace informal expressions with formal equivalents.\n3. Add relative clauses when necessary.\n\nBut how to determine which step applies to which input?\n\nLooking at the first input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Active to passive: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So passive voice conversion.\n\nSecond input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Passive voice again: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nThird input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the output adds \"whom\": \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". This seems like converting a possessive pronoun into a relative clause. So maybe the instruction was to replace possessive pronouns with relative clauses when they are followed by a past participle.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Synonym replacement.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Synonym replacement.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to perform the following transformations:\n\n- If the input contains a possessive pronoun followed by a past participle, replace the possessive with \"whom\".\n- If the input contains a verb phrase that can be passivized, convert it to passive voice.\n- If the input contains a colloquial expression (like \"can't stand\"), replace it with a more formal equivalent.\n- If the input contains a phrase like \"looks like\", replace it with \"resembles\".\n\nBut this seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, which could involve any of these transformations depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms, but only when they are part of a specific phrase. For example, \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\", \"looks like\" → \"resembles\". The first two outputs are passive voice, but the third is a relative clause. So maybe the instruction was to apply different transformations based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version by making it passive, replacing informal expressions, and adding relative clauses as needed.

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule from the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n4. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nHmm. Let's look at each transformation step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input uses \"considered many approaches,\" and the output changes \"many\" to \"various\" and reorders the sentence slightly. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or standard English version? But why \"various\" instead of \"numerous\"? Maybe \"various\" is a synonym but used in a different context. Wait, \"considered many approaches\" vs \"various approaches were considered.\" The structure here is changed from subject + verb + object to object + past tense verb. So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into passive voice? Let's check the other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is slang meaning great. The output replaces it with \"incredibly good,\" which is a more formal way. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more standard equivalents. But why \"incredibly good\"? Because \"fire\" is slang, so maybe the instruction is to replace informal terms with their standard counterparts. But then the third example is a question being turned into a suggestion. Let's see.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" The output is a rephrasing of the question into a polite request using \"shall\" and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert questions into polite requests, possibly using different phrasing. But how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nFourth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the input uses a non-restrictive relative clause (\"I met yesterday\"), and the output adds \"whom\" to make it a restrictive clause. Wait, no. The original has \"I met yesterday\" as part of the relative clause. The output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So the instruction might be to convert non-restrictive relative clauses into restrictive ones by replacing \"I/me\" with \"whom.\" But wait, the original is \"I met yesterday,\" which is a non-restrictive clause because it's separated by a comma. The output removes the comma and uses \"whom,\" making it restrictive. So maybe the instruction is to turn non-restrictive relative clauses into restrictive ones by adding \"whom\" and removing commas. But let's check the fifth example.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The output changes \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So here, the instruction might involve rephrasing common phrases into more formal alternatives. For example, replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nNow, looking back at the first example, the input is \"I considered many approaches.\" The output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the structure here is changed from subject-verb-object to object-past tense verb. That seems like converting to passive voice. Let's check the other examples:\n\nSecond input: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Passive voice isn't involved here. Third input: question to suggestion. Fourth input: changing relative clause from non-restrictive to restrictive. Fifth input: rephrasing a phrase.\n\nSo maybe the instruction is not a single rule but a combination of possible transformations. However, the user mentioned that the friend read the instruction and applied it to each input. So there must be a consistent rule across all examples.\n\nWait, let's think again. The first example's output is passive voice. The second example's output is replacing slang with a synonym. The third is turning a question into a suggestion. The fourth is changing a non-restrictive relative clause to restrictive. The fifth is rephrasing a common phrase into a more formal version.\n\nBut how can these all be covered by a single instruction? Unless the instruction is to perform multiple transformations depending on the input. For example, if the input contains a non-restrictive relative clause, apply the restrictive clause change; if it's a question, turn it into a suggestion; if it's slang, replace it with a synonym; if it's a phrase like \"can't tell the difference,\" rephrase it; and if it's a sentence with \"many approaches,\" rephrase to passive voice.\n\nBut that seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version, using appropriate transformations based on the context. For example:\n\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it into a polite request (like changing \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\").\n- If the input uses slang (like \"fire\"), replace it with a more formal equivalent.\n- If the input has a non-restrictive relative clause (like \"I met yesterday\"), convert it to a restrictive by adding \"whom\" and removing the comma.\n- If the input uses \"many approaches,\" rephrase to passive voice.\n- If the input uses \"can't tell the difference,\" rephrase to \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nBut the problem is that the instruction should be a single, concise set of rules. The user probably expects a single instruction that covers all these cases. Let's think about possible instructions.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example, the first output is more formal than the input. The second replaces slang with a more formal term. The third turns a casual question into a polite suggestion. The fourth adds formality by using \"whom\" and making it restrictive. The fifth uses a more formal phrasing.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate transformations. But how to phrase that as a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more standard or grammatically correct form, considering various linguistic features. For example:\n\n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or standard English version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed.\"\n\nBut that's quite broad. However, the examples show specific transformations. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The key changes are \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered\" (passive voice), \"many\" becomes \"various.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert active voice to passive voice when possible, and replace certain adjectives or adverbs with synonyms.\n\nSecond example: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good.\" So maybe the instruction includes replacing informal or colloquial expressions with their standard equivalents.\n\nThird example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" The question is rephrased into a suggestion using \"shall\" and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you.\" So perhaps the instruction involves converting questions into polite requests, possibly using different phrasing.\n\nFourth example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the non-restrictive relative clause \"I met yesterday\" is converted to a restrictive by adding \"whom\" and removing the comma. So the instruction might include modifying relative clauses to be more restrictive when appropriate.\n\nFifth example: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The phrase \"can't tell the difference\" is rephrased into a more formal expression. So perhaps the instruction includes replacing common phrases with their more formal counterparts.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations depending on the input's characteristics. However, the user might have given a single instruction that encompasses all these cases. Let's think of possible instructions that could cover all these scenarios.\n\nOne possible instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or standard English version, adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure as needed.\" But this is very general. Alternatively, the instruction could specify to perform specific transformations based on certain criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal tone, using appropriate language choices. For example:\n\n\"Polish each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing as necessary.\"\n\nBut again, this is vague. However, considering the examples, the instruction might involve several specific steps:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice where applicable.\n2. Replace informal expressions with their standard equivalents.\n3. Convert questions into polite suggestions using \"shall<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let's start by listing them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction is about converting certain phrases or structures in the input into more formal or different phrasing. Let's break down each pair.\n\nFirst pair: \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". So changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and replacing \"stand\" with \"tolerate\". Maybe the instruction is to convert informal contractions to more formal versions. But wait, \"can't\" vs \"cannot\" is part of that. Also, \"stand his temper\" vs \"tolerate his temper\". So perhaps replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSecond pair: \"whole story was made up\" becomes \"entire story was fabricated\". Here, \"whole\" is replaced with \"entire\", and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So maybe replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nThird pair: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So changing the question structure from \"do you want [me to do X]\" to \"shall I X\". The subject-verb inversion here: \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\". Also, \"go with you\" becomes \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to\".\n\nFourth pair: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This seems like a more formal rephrasing. The original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction is to convert statements expressing opinions into suggestions or recommendations. For example, \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that...\".\n\nFifth pair: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is changed to \"whom I met\". So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That suggests changing the possessive pronoun to an objective one when necessary. Wait, but in the original, it's \"I met yesterday\", and the output is \"whom I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" to use the correct object pronoun after a preposition. Wait, but \"met\" is a past tense verb, so the object pronoun would be \"me\", not \"whom\". Unless there's a specific context where \"whom\" is required. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to make it more formal or to use a relative clause. But in standard English, \"I met\" is correct, and \"whom I met\" is also correct but less commonly used. However, the output here uses \"whom\", which might be part of a relative clause. Let me check: \"The lawyer [whom I met] was helpful.\" So the output is using a relative clause with \"whom\", whereas the input uses a participle phrase \"I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to convert participle phrases into relative clauses with \"whom\".\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be to rephrase the input sentences according to certain grammatical rules or style preferences. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first four examples, they seem to involve changing parts of speech or phrases to more formal equivalents. The fifth example is about changing a participle phrase to a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert certain verbs or phrases into their more formal counterparts. For instance:\n\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n- \"whole story\" → \"entire story\"\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n- \"do anything\" → \"take no action\"\n- \"suggested\" (implied) → \"it is suggested\"\n\nBut how does that apply to all inputs? Let's see:\n\nWait, the fourth input's output is a complete sentence starting with \"It is suggested...\", which wasn't present in the input. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a suggestion or recommendation, especially when the input expresses an opinion or negative view.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third input: changing \"Do you want me to...\" to \"Shall I...\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase questions using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to\".\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate\", which is more formal. Similarly, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\", which is a more formal term. \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a more formal way to ask for permission or agreement.\n\nIn the fourth example, the output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\", which is a formal way to present advice. The input is a statement of opinion (\"We don't think it's a good idea...\").\n\nThe fifth example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is a more formal construction, though less common. In standard English, \"I met\" is correct, but \"whom I met\" is also correct but often replaced with \"I met\". However, in some contexts, especially formal writing, \"whom\" is preferred after a preposition. But here, the preposition is \"met\", which is followed by an object. Wait, \"met\" is the past tense of \"meet\", which is a transitive verb. So the object would be \"me\", not \"whom\". So why is \"whom\" used here? Maybe the instruction is to use \"whom\" in such cases, even though it's not strictly necessary. Alternatively, maybe the input had a different structure. Wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction might be to insert \"whom\" before the participle phrase \"I met yesterday\" to make it a relative clause. But in standard English, \"I met\" is correct. So perhaps the instruction is to convert participle phrases into relative clauses with \"whom\", making the sentence more formal.\n\nSo putting all this together, the instruction could be something like: \"Convert the input sentence into a more formal version by replacing certain phrases, adjusting verb forms, and restructuring sentences as needed.\" But we need to find a precise instruction that covers all these transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, using synonyms or different structures. Let's check each input-output pair again with this in mind.\n\n1. \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\": replacing the contraction with the full form and changing the verb.\n2. \"whole story\" → \"entire story\": replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n3. \"do you want me to...\" → \"shall I...\": changing the question structure to a more formal \"shall I\".\n4. \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"is suggested that no action should be taken\": rephrasing the opinion into a suggestion.\n5. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\": inserting \"whom\" to make the participle phrase a relative clause.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rephrase each input sentence into a more formal version by replacing informal contractions with their formal equivalents, adjusting verb forms, restructuring questions to use 'shall I', converting opinions into suggestions, and inserting 'whom' in appropriate places to enhance formality.\"\n\nBut let's verify if this instruction would cover all the examples. For instance, the fourth example's output is a complete sentence starting with \"It is suggested...\", which wasn't part of the input. So the instruction must include generating new phrases like \"It is suggested that...\" when the input expresses an opinion. That suggests that the instruction is to take the input and rephrase it into a formal suggestion or recommendation, especially when the input is an opinion or negative statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words or phrases, adjusting grammar, and possibly adding phrases like \"It is suggested that...\" when necessary.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal version by replacing contractions, changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I\", replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\", and \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". But how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input sentence using<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate all these outputs from the given inputs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\nInputs:\n1. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n3. \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n4. \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n5. \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction is about rephrasing or converting the input into a more formal or polite version? Let's check each pair.\n\n1. The first input is a question asking if the speaker should accompany someone. The output is a more formal way of saying the same thing, using \"Shall I\" instead of \"Do you want me to...\" So maybe the instruction is to convert casual questions into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\n2. The second input is a casual greeting or farewell. The output uses \"look forward to\" which is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\n3. The third input is a statement expressing an opinion. The output changes \"I think that\" to \"It is my opinion that,\" which is a more formal way of stating an opinion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements into a more formal tone, possibly making them sound more professional or academic.\n\n4. The fourth input is a thank you note. The output uses \"assistance is much appreciated\" instead of \"thanks.\" This seems like converting gratitude into a more formal or eloquent expression. So maybe the instruction is to transform expressions of thanks into more formal or polite alternatives.\n\n5. The fifth input is a comparison using \"looks like.\" The output replaces it with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. So here, the instruction might be to replace certain words or phrases with their more formal equivalents.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction likely involves converting the input into a more formal or polite version. Each example shows a shift towards formality, whether in phrasing questions, greetings, opinions, gratitude, or comparisons.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another angle. For example, some outputs seem to be restatements rather than direct translations. Like the third input becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which is a different structure but conveys the same meaning. Similarly, the fourth input's output is a more elaborate way of thanking. The first input's output is a rephrased question into a suggestion.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing certain words or phrases. For instance, changing \"you\" to \"you\" (no change), but adjusting the sentence structure. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the output more indirect or polite, like turning requests into suggestions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the verbs used: \"accompany\" vs. \"go with,\" \"look forward to\" vs. \"see,\" \"is my opinion\" vs. \"think,\" \"assistance is appreciated\" vs. \"help,\" \"resemble\" vs. \"look like.\" All these are synonyms but more formal or precise.\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Convert the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\" Or perhaps \"Rephrase the input into a more polite or formal tone, maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against all examples. For example, the first input is a question. The output is a suggestion phrased as a question. So maybe the instruction is to turn requests into polite suggestions. But the second input is a greeting, which becomes a more formal expression of anticipation. Third is changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way. Fourth is converting \"Thanks\" into a more formal expression. Fifth is replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" a synonym but more formal.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rewrite the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents and adjusting the sentence structure accordingly.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the output more indirect or polite, such as turning direct questions into suggestions or offers. For example, the first input is a question asking permission, and the output is a polite offer (\"Shall I...\"). That fits with making the request more polite by offering to do something.\n\nSimilarly, \"See you tonight\" is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of looking forward to seeing them. So perhaps the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite alternatives, often by rephrasing the entire sentence rather than just replacing words.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs sometimes start with \"I\" or \"It,\" whereas the inputs don't always. For example, the first output starts with \"Shall I,\" which is a first-person offer. The second output starts with \"I look forward,\" which is first person. The third starts with \"It is my opinion,\" third person. The fourth is \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is second person. The fifth is \"She resembles her sister,\" third person. So the outputs vary in person, but the inputs are mostly third person except the first two, which are second person.\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or polite version regardless of the original person. For example, turning second-person questions into first-person offers, or third-person statements into more formal expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting the sentence structure and using more formal language. For example, changing \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a more formal way of suggesting accompaniment.\n\nSo putting all this together, the most likely instruction is: \"Convert the input into a more formal or polite version by rephrasing the sentence structure and using more formal language equivalents.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's check each example against this instruction:\n\n1. Input: Casual question. Output: Formal offer. Fits.\n2. Input: Casual greeting. Output: Formal anticipation. Fits.\n3. Input: Statement with \"I think.\" Output: Formal opinion statement. Fits.\n4. Input: Gratitude. Output: Formal expression of appreciation. Fits.\n5. Input: Comparison with \"looks like.\" Output: Formal synonym. Fits.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, adjusting the sentence structure and vocabulary accordingly.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert each input into a more formal or polite version** by rephrasing the sentence structure and using more formal language equivalents. This involved transforming casual questions into polite offers, informal greetings into formal expressions of anticipation, subjective statements into formal opinions, gratitude into eloquent acknowledgments, and comparisons using more precise synonyms. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by adjusting sentence structure and vocabulary.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. My job is to determine the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: The whole story was made up.\n   Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\n2. Input: I considered many approaches.\n   Output: Various approaches were considered.\n\n3. Input: I can't tell the difference between these two.\n   Output: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\n\n4. Input: I can't stand his temper.\n   Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n\n5. Input: See you tonight.\n   Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n\nLooking at these examples, I notice that in some cases, the output is a more formal or polite version of the input. For example, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal expression. Similarly, \"look forward to\" is a more polite way to say \"see you.\" \n\nAnother observation is that some outputs use synonyms but maintain the same meaning. Like \"whole\" vs. \"entire,\" \"considered\" vs. \"considered\" (wait, no, the second input's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" Wait, the input was \"I considered many approaches.\" So the output uses \"various\" instead of \"many,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. Similarly, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but maybe more technical.\n\nWait, but \"made up\" can mean both \"composed\" or \"fabricated.\" In this case, the output uses \"fabricated,\" which is a stronger term. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their more formal or precise counterparts.\n\nLooking at the third example: \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both mean the same thing, but the latter is more formal. The fourth example changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal way. The fifth example replaces \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more polite and formal expression.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. But let's check the first example: \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is a synonym, and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nBut wait, in the second example, \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. So replacing \"many\" with \"various\" might be part of the instruction.\n\nSimilarly, \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a more polite and formal way to express the same idea. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more concise or precise. Let's check each example:\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\" Both are synonyms, but \"fabricated\" is more precise in the context of stories being made up.\n\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" \"Many\" → \"various,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. Also, the structure remains similar.\n\n3. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The structure changes slightly, but the meaning is preserved. \"Can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\n4. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" \"Can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\n5. Input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a complete rephrasing into a more polite and formal expression.\n\nSo putting this all together, the instruction likely involves converting the input into a more formal or polite version. However, looking at the first example, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated,\" which is a more precise term. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal or precise counterparts. Alternatively, it could be about making the sentence more concise or using synonyms.\n\nWait, but in the first example, \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. \"Made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but more precise. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their more formal or precise synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more formal style, possibly using more precise vocabulary. Let's check another example: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" is replaced with \"various,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace \"many\" with \"various\" when appropriate.\n\nBut why not other synonyms? For example, \"many\" could also be replaced with \"numerous,\" but in this case, it's \"various.\" So maybe the instruction is specific to certain words or phrases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to make the sentence more concise. For example, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a bit more wordy but maintains the same meaning. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more polite or formal. For example, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more polite way to express the same idea. Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\nBut then why does \"I considered many approaches\" become \"Various approaches were considered\"? That's a more formal way of saying the same thing. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms where possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more precise. For example, \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a more precise term. \"Considered\" stays the same, but \"many\" becomes \"various.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain adjectives or adverbs with their more precise or formal counterparts.\n\nLet me think about the verbs. \"Considered\" is kept as is, but \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs with their more precise synonyms. For example, \"make up\" (as in invent) becomes \"fabricate.\" Similarly, \"stand\" becomes \"tolerate,\" which is a synonym but more formal.\n\nIn the third example, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase common phrases into more formal equivalents.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction is to make the sentence more concise. For example, \"I can't tell the difference between these two\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" But the first example becomes longer, so that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their antonyms or related terms. But in the first example, \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is a synonym, not an antonym. So that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the first example again: \"The whole story was made up\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, but \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but more precise. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more precise or formal counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" \"Many\" becomes \"various,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace \"many\" with \"various\" when appropriate.\n\nBut why not other synonyms? For example, \"numerous\" or \"several.\" The choice here is \"various,\" which suggests that the instruction might have a specific set of replacements or rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentence more concise by removing unnecessary words. For example, \"I can't tell the difference between these two\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" But the first example adds words (\"the entire\" instead of \"the whole\"), so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more polite or formal. For example, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more polite way to express the same idea. Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\nBut how does that apply to the first example? \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, the formality increases, but<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input has a corresponding output that seems to follow some kind of transformation rule. Let me look at them one by one and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nWait, here the output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". But in the original sentence, the subject is \"the lawyer\", and the verb is \"was\". The object of the preposition \"met\" would be \"yesterday\", but maybe the structure here is different. Wait, actually, the original sentence is \"I met the lawyer yesterday.\" So when they say \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\", it's using a relative clause where \"I met\" is the verb phrase. Adding \"whom\" here might be changing the relative pronoun from \"that\" or \"who\" to \"whom\". But in the output, it's just adding \"whom\" without changing the rest. Maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" in such cases?\n\nBut wait, looking at the second input-output pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nHere, the output replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". That's a different structure. So maybe the instruction isn't a simple addition but a more complex transformation. Let's check the third pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nThis seems like a rephrasing. Instead of thanking directly, it's expressing gratitude through another phrasing. So maybe the instruction is to convert expressions of thanks into more formal or indirect expressions.\n\nFourth input-output pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, the output changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase first-person opinions into a more formal or indirect structure.\n\nFifth input-output pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nThis looks like a synonym replacement. \"Made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms.\n\nNow, putting all these together, each input-output pair shows a different type of transformation. The first one adds \"whom\", the second uses a different prepositional phrase, the third rephrases thanks, the fourth changes \"I think\" to \"my opinion\", and the fifth replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nBut the problem states that the instruction was given once, and the friend applied it to all inputs. So there must be a single instruction that encompasses all these transformations. Let's think about possible instructions.\n\nOne possibility is that the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect style. For example, replacing contractions, using more formal language, etc. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met...\". Here, \"I met\" is changed to \"whom I met\". Wait, no, the original is \"I met the lawyer yesterday\", so in the output, it's \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\". So the structure is similar, but the relative pronoun is changed from \"that\" (implied) to \"whom\". But in the original, the relative clause is \"I met the lawyer yesterday\", which could be rewritten as \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to use \"whom\" in relative clauses where the antecedent is the subject of the main clause.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival\". This is a change in prepositional phrase. \"Once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain time-related expressions with others.\n\nThird input: Direct thanks converted to a more formal expression. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase expressions of gratitude into more formal terms.\n\nFourth input: Changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\". This is a common way to rephrase first-person opinions into a more formal tone.\n\nFifth input: Synonym replacement. \"Made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated\".\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction might be a set of rules that apply to different parts of speech or structures. However, the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction, not multiple. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect style, which includes various transformations depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a passive voice? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: Active voice becomes passive? Original is active (\"The lawyer was helpful\"), output is same. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there\" is active. Output is also active. No.\n\nThird input: Same structure, just rephrased.\n\nFourth input: \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\". Not passive.\n\nFifth input: Passive? \"The whole story was made up\" vs \"The entire story was fabricated\". Both passive. So maybe the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive voice. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The lawyer was helpful\" (passive) → output same. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call upon your arrival\" (active) → output same. No.\n\nThird input: \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (active) → output same. No.\n\nFourth input: \"It is my opinion\" (active) → output same. No.\n\nFifth input: Passive. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs seem to be more formal. For example, replacing contractions (though none are present here), using \"upon\" instead of \"once\", \"your assistance\" instead of \"thanks\", etc. Maybe the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more formal ones, which could involve various transformations like replacing contractions, using more formal prepositions, rephrasing thanks, changing \"I think\" to \"it is my opinion\", and replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nBut how to unify these into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect style, which may involve any of several transformations depending on the context. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\", converting \"made up\" to \"fabricated\", using \"upon\" instead of \"once\", adding \"whom\" in relative clauses, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to use a specific translation method, like replacing certain words or phrases. For instance, \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\", \"helpful\" → \"helpful\" (no change here). But the first input's output doesn't change \"helpful\", so that's not a general rule.\n\nWait, looking back at the first input-output pair: the only difference is the addition of \"whom\". So maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" in relative clauses where the antecedent is the subject of the main clause. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nYes, here \"I met\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". So adding \"whom\" there. Another example: \"The man I saw was tall.\" → \"The man whom I saw was tall.\" That fits.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain temporal expressions with others. For example, replacing \"once\" + clause with \"upon\" + noun phrase.\n\nThird input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a complete rephrasing. So maybe the instruction is to convert expressions of gratitude into more formal expressions.\n\nFourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Again, a rephrasing of the speaker's opinion into a more formal structure.\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Synonym replacement.\n\nSo the instruction could be a combination of different transformations. However, the problem states that the instruction was a single instruction. Therefore, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect style, which may involve any of several possible transformations depending on the context. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\", converting \"made up\" to \"fabricated\", using \"upon\" instead of \"once\", adding \"whom\" in relative clauses, etc.\n\nBut how to describe this as a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to \"rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect style, which may include replacing contractions, using more formal prepositions, rephrasing expressions of gratitude, converting first-person opinions into third-person statements, and replacing certain phrases with their synonyms.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a more polite or formal register, which could involve any of the transformations observed. However, since the user expects a precise answer, perhaps the instruction is to \"convert the input into a more formal or indirect style by applying any of the following transformations: replacing 'I think' with 'it is my opinion', replacing 'made up' with 'fabricated', replacing<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input has a corresponding output that seems to be a rephrased version. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nFirst pair: Input \"She looks like her sister.\" Output \"She resembles her sister.\" So here, the verb \"looks\" is replaced with \"resembles\". Maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs with synonyms? But wait, \"resembles\" is a synonym, but maybe there's more to it. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". So instead of using a time phrase, they're using a prepositional phrase with \"upon\". That suggests replacing temporal expressions with more formal or specific phrasing.\n\nThird input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" So \"fire\" is an informal slang term, replaced with \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction is to translate informal expressions into more standard phrasing.\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject-verb structure is changed from first person (\"I considered\") to passive voice (\"were considered\"). Also, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\". So perhaps the instruction involves converting first-person statements into third-person or passive voice, and modifying adjectives or nouns.\n\nFifth input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So the direct expression of gratitude is turned into a more formal or indirect phrasing, using \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated\".\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see if that fits all cases.\n\nFirst example: \"She looks like her sister.\" Formal rephrasing could use \"resembles\" as in \"She resembles her sister.\" That works.\n\nSecond example: \"Please call once you get there.\" Formal phrasing would use \"upon your arrival\" instead of the casual \"once you get there\". Makes sense.\n\nThird example: \"This song is fire.\" Fire is slang; replacing with \"incredibly good\" is a common way to express approval formally.\n\nFourth example: \"I considered many approaches.\" Changing to passive voice and using \"various\" instead of \"many\" adds formality. Also, the subject changes from first person to passive.\n\nFifth example: Direct thanks becomes a more indirect expression of gratitude, using \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\".\n\nSo the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or professional version. Each output is a more formal or indirect way of expressing the same idea. Therefore, the original instruction was probably something like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite manner.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite manner.\"**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nEach input was transformed into a more formal, indirect, or polite phrasing. Key patterns include:\n1. **Synonym substitution** (e.g., \"resembles\" for \"looks like\").\n2. **Rephrasing temporal expressions** (e.g., \"upon your arrival\" for \"once you get there\").\n3. **Replacing informal terms** (e.g., \"incredibly good\" for \"fire\").\n4. **Passivization** (e.g., \"were considered\" instead of \"I considered\").\n5. **Indirect gratitude** (e.g., \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" for \"Thanks for your help\").\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into more formal or standard English? Let's check each case.\n\nFirst pair: The input is informal (\"See you\") and the output is more polite and formal (\"look forward to meeting\"). So maybe the instruction was to make the greeting more formal or polite.\n\nSecond pair: The input uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is informal, and the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is more formal. So similar pattern here—replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nThird pair: \"fire\" is slang for \"amazing\" or \"great,\" but the output uses \"incredibly good,\" which is a more standard way to express approval. So replacing slang with standard phrasing.\n\nFourth pair: \"looks like\" is informal, and \"resembles\" is more formal. So replacing informal phrasing with more formal terms.\n\nFifth pair: The input uses the possessive pronoun \"I met,\" while the output uses the relative pronoun \"whom I met.\" Wait, but in the output, it's written as \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" would be using the objective case instead of the subject case. But wait, in the original input, it's \"I met,\" which is correct (subject case). However, the output uses \"whom,\" which is also correct but less commonly used in modern informal speech. So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition. But in this case, the original input already uses \"I met,\" which is correct. Maybe the instruction was to convert the possessive \"I\" to \"me\" in some contexts? Wait, no. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So they changed \"I\" to \"whom.\" That's a case of changing the subject form to the object form when it's the object of a preposition. But in the original input, \"I met\" is the subject of the clause \"I met yesterday,\" so \"I\" is correct. However, in the output, they changed \"I\" to \"whom,\" which is the object form. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" whenever it's the object of a preposition. But in the original input, \"I\" is the subject, not the object. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use more formal language, and in this case, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" as part of making it more formal. But why would that be necessary? Because \"whom\" is more formal than \"I.\" So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain cases where it's the object of a preposition. But in the original input, \"I\" is the subject. Hmm, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal way, and in this case, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" as part of that. But that seems a bit odd because \"I\" is correct. Unless the original input had a mistake, but the user provided the input as \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" which is correct. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it's the object of a preposition. Wait, but in the output, they used \"whom,\" not \"me.\" So perhaps the instruction was to use the objective case when appropriate. But in the original input, \"I\" is correct. So maybe the instruction was to make the entire sentence more formal, and in this case, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" as part of that. But that's a very specific change. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace contractions with full forms. For example, \"I met\" is a contraction of \"I have met,\" but the output doesn't show any such replacement. So that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all the outputs, they seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. Let's check each one:\n\n1. Original: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So replacing the informal greeting with a more formal one.\n2. Original: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Again, replacing informal phrasing with more formal.\n3. Original: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Replacing slang with standard phrasing.\n4. Original: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Changing \"looks like\" to \"resembles,\" which is more formal.\n5. Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Changing \"I\" to \"whom,\" which is more formal.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version. Each output is a more formal version of the input. Let's verify each case:\n\n- \"See you\" is informal; \"look forward to meeting\" is more formal.\n- \"can't tell\" is informal; \"find it hard to distinguish\" is more formal.\n- \"fire\" is slang; \"incredibly good\" is standard.\n- \"looks like\" is informal; \"resembles\" is more formal.\n- \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" is more formal (using \"whom\" instead of \"I\").\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something like: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents.\"\n\nBut let's check if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert the first person singular pronoun \"I\" to third person \"he/she/they\" when referring to oneself. But in the fifth input, the output uses \"whom,\" not a third person pronoun. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace contractions with full forms. But in the first input, \"See you\" isn't a contraction. The second input has \"can't,\" which is a contraction, but the output doesn't show it expanded. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the third input, \"fire\" is slang for \"amazing,\" and the output uses \"incredibly good.\" So replacing slang with standard adjectives. Similarly, the fourth input replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but more formal. The fifth input changes \"I\" to \"whom,\" which is more formal. So combining all these, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly including replacing informal expressions, slang, contractions, and adjusting pronoun usage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more polite or professional. For example, the first input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal one. The second input is a complaint about not being able to tell differences, and the output is a more diplomatic way of saying the same thing. The third input is an exclamation of approval, replaced with a more measured statement. The fourth input is a comparison, replaced with a synonym. The fifth input is a simple statement, but the output uses \"whom\" instead of \"I,\" which is more formal.\n\nPutting all these together, the most comprehensive instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, replacing informal expressions, slang, contractions, and adjusting pronoun usage where appropriate. Therefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, replacing informal expressions, slang, contractions, and adjusting pronoun usage as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version**, specifically focusing on:\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting\").\n2. **Substituting slang** with standard terminology (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n3. **Adjusting contractions** (though none were present in the examples).\n4. **Updating pronoun usage** (e.g., changing \"I\" to \"whom\" for object cases).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, replacing informal expressions, slang, and adjusting pronoun usage where necessary.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into a corresponding output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n5. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nLooking at these, I need to find a common transformation or rule that applies to all of them. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a question asking if someone can do something. The output is a rephrased question using \"would\" instead of \"can,\" and changing \"do\" to \"accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? But why only some inputs?\n\nSecond input: The input is a thank you note. The output uses \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\" instead of \"help.\" So perhaps replacing certain words or phrases with synonyms or more formal terms?\n\nThird input: The input is a negative statement (\"can't stand\") which becomes \"cannot tolerate.\" So maybe replacing informal expressions with more formal ones?\n\nFourth input: The input is a statement expressing hesitation (\"don't think it's a good idea...\"). The output turns it into a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\" So here, the structure is changed from a personal opinion to a formal suggestion.\n\nFifth input: The input is a statement about considering multiple approaches. The output uses \"various\" instead of \"many.\" So replacing \"many\" with \"various\" might be part of the pattern.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. Let's see:\n\n- The second example uses more formal language (assistance vs. help).\n- The third example replaces informal expressions with more formal ones.\n- The fourth example changes the structure from a personal view to a formal suggestion.\n- The fifth example replaces \"many\" with \"various.\"\n- The first example changes \"can you do\" to \"would you be able to accomplish,\" which seems like making it more polite or formal.\n\nWait, but the first example is a question. The output is also a question but phrased differently. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect request? But the second input is a statement, not a question. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or professional tone. Let's check each example against that possibility.\n\nFirst input: Original is a question. Output is a rephrased question using \"would\" and \"accomplish,\" which sounds more formal. So maybe converting questions into more formal versions.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a more formal way of thanking someone, using \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\" instead of \"help\" and \"thanks.\"\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal expression.\n\nFourth input: The original is a statement of opinion. The output is a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\" which is a more formal way of presenting advice.\n\nFifth input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" Replacing \"many\" with \"various\" to use a more formal term.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone. Let's check if this holds for all examples.\n\nFirst example fits: turning a question into a more formal version.\n\nSecond example: replacing \"help\" with \"assistance,\" which is more formal.\n\nThird example: replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal.\n\nFourth example: changing from a personal opinion to a formal suggestion.\n\nFifth example: replacing \"many\" with \"various,\" a more formal term.\n\nBut wait, the fourth example's input is a statement, and the output is a suggestion. So the instruction could be to rephrase statements into suggestions or recommendations, but that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, the first example is a question, not a statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or formal version, regardless of the original sentence type. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" This is a more polite way of asking, using \"would\" and \"able to accomplish\" instead of \"can do.\"\n\nOriginal: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Again, more formal.\n\nOriginal: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" More formal.\n\nOriginal: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a formal suggestion.\n\nOriginal: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Replacing \"many\" with \"various,\" more formal.\n\nSo in all cases, the output is a more formal version of the input. The first example is a question made more polite, the second a thank you made more formal, the third a negative statement made more formal, the fourth a personal opinion turned into a formal suggestion, and the fifth a count noun phrase made more formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone. However, let's check if there's another possible instruction.\n\nAnother angle: Could it be about changing the subject or perspective? For example, the fourth input is a first-person statement, and the output is a third-person suggestion. But that doesn't fit all examples. The first example remains first-person.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a different tense or voice. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: present tense → output is present tense.\n\nSecond input: past tense → output is present tense.\n\nThird input: present tense → output is present tense.\n\nFourth input: present tense → output is present tense.\n\nFifth input: present tense → output is present tense.\n\nSo tenses didn't change. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a question. But the first input is already a question, and the output is a question. The second input is a statement, and the output is a question. That doesn't make sense. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a different type of sentence. For example, the fourth input is a statement, and the output is a suggestion. But the first input is a question, output is a question. So that's inconsistent.\n\nBack to the formal tone idea. Let's see if all examples fit that.\n\nYes:\n\n1. Question made more polite.\n2. Thank you made more formal.\n3. Negative statement made more formal.\n4. Opinion turned into a formal suggestion.\n5. Count noun phrase made more formal.\n\nSo the instruction is likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone. Therefore, the original instruction was probably something like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or professional version.\"\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a different type of sentence, but that doesn't fit all examples. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms. For example, \"help\" → \"assistance,\" \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate,\" \"many\" → \"various,\" etc. But the fourth example's input is a statement of opinion, which becomes a suggestion. So replacing \"don't think\" with \"is suggested that...\" which is a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more indirect or polite form. For example, the first input is a direct question, and the output is a more indirect question. The second input is a direct thank you, output is more indirect. Third input is a direct negative statement, output is more indirect. Fourth input is a direct statement, output is a suggestion. Fifth input is a direct statement, output is more indirect.\n\nHmm, but the fourth example's output is a suggestion, which is a different structure. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a suggestion or recommendation. But then why does the first example become a question? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect request. For example, the first input is a question, output is a more formal question. The second input is a statement of thanks, output is a more formal expression of gratitude. The third input is a complaint, output is a more formal complaint. The fourth input is a statement of opinion, output is a formal suggestion. The fifth input is a statement of fact, output is a more formal version.\n\nIn that case, the instruction could be to rephrase each<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each output seems to be a slightly modified version of the input. Let me look at each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSo here, the verb changed from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Both mean not being able to bear something. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs with synonyms or rephrase the sentence structure.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nAgain, changing \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace common phrasal verbs with their synonyms.\n\nThird example:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, the structure changed from first-person (\"I think\") to a more formal \"It is my opinion that...\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase statements into a more formal or indirect way of expressing the same idea.\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nChanged \"made up\" (meaning invented) to \"fabricated.\" So replacing colloquial expressions with more formal terms.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nHere, the phrase \"can't tell the difference\" became \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So again, changing a common expression to a more formal or precise phrasing.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might be asking the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or precise version. Let's check if there's a common thread here.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or use different phrasing but maintain the same meaning. For example, replacing contractions with non-contracted forms, using more formal verbs, restructuring sentences for clarity, etc.\n\nWait, another angle: the outputs sometimes use \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" which is a more indirect way of stating an opinion. Similarly, \"resembles\" vs. \"looks like,\" \"fabricated\" vs. \"made up,\" \"distinguish\" vs. \"tell the difference.\"\n\nSo possible instruction could be: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal or precise version, avoiding contractions and using synonyms where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite or indirect form. For instance, changing direct statements to more indirect expressions.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs often start with \"I\" in the first example, but the second uses \"She.\" Wait, no, the second output starts with \"She.\" Wait, the first input is about \"his temper,\" so the subject is third person. The output is also third person. The second input is about \"her sister,\" so third person. The third input is \"I think,\" so first person. The output is \"It is my opinion,\" which is still third person. The fourth input is \"The whole story,\" third person. Output is same. Fifth input is \"I can't tell,\" first person, output is \"I find it hard,\" first person. So the outputs vary in person depending on the input. But the instruction might not specify person, just to rephrase.\n\nBut the key is the transformation pattern. Let's see:\n\n1. Change \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\"\n2. Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n3. Convert \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n4. Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n5. Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nSo the instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal or precise version, possibly using synonyms, restructuring sentences, or converting to a more indirect expression.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to make the output more polite or less direct. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" makes it less direct. Similarly, \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard,\" which is a softer way of expressing difficulty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more academic or professional tone, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nPutting all this together, the most probable instruction is something like: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or precise version, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring as needed.\" Or perhaps, \"Convert each statement into a more indirect or polite expression.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a specific pattern. For example, the first four outputs all seem to have replaced a common phrase with a synonym. The fifth one is similar. The third example changes the entire sentence structure. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms, avoiding contractions, and restructuring when necessary.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more neutral or objective tone. For instance, changing \"I can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\" removes the personal emotion, making it more objective.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some use \"my opinion\" which is a more formal way of stating a subjective view. Similarly, \"resembles\" is a more precise term than \"looks like.\" \"Fabricated\" is a stronger term than \"made up.\" \"Distinguish\" is more precise than \"tell the difference.\"\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Express each statement in a more formal or precise manner, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct form, such as converting direct statements into reported speech or using more passive voice.\n\nWait, looking at the third example: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" That's a shift from first-person to third-person, but the content remains the same. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase opinions into a more formal or indirect structure.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth example changes \"I can't tell\" to \"I find it hard,\" which is a more indirect way of expressing inability.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, or indirect version, possibly using synonyms, restructuring sentences, and avoiding contractions or informal expressions.\n\nTherefore, the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or precise version, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was: **\"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or precise version, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring as needed.\"**\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Synonym Replacement:** Outputs often use synonyms (e.g., \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand,\" \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\").\n2. **Structural Changes:** Sentences were restructured (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\").\n3. **Formality:** Informal expressions (contractions, direct statements) were converted to more formal or indirect phrasing (e.g., \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n\nThis instruction aimed to transform inputs into clearer, more precise, and contextually appropriate versions.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

So, looking at each pair, there's a pattern here. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Hmm, so \"fire\" is being replaced with \"incredibly good\". Wait, but \"fire\" is slang for something really good. So maybe the instruction is to replace idiomatic expressions or slang with more formal synonyms? But wait, \"incredibly good\" is a bit more formal than \"fire\", which is informal. But maybe the instruction is to rephrase in a more standard way. Let me check the other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various\". So maybe replacing common adjectives or phrases with their synonym versions. But \"considered\" stays the same. So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words with more formal or precise alternatives. But why not \"numerous\" instead of \"various\"? Maybe \"various\" is a synonym that's more general. Alternatively, maybe it's about rephrasing the sentence structure rather than just replacing words.\n\nThird input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Whole\" becomes \"entire\", \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So here, both words are replaced with synonyms. \"Entire\" is a synonym for \"whole\", and \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\". So maybe the instruction is to replace specific words with their synonyms, especially when they're part of a phrase.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" \"Looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". So again, replacing a phrase with a synonym. \"Looks like\" is a colloquial expression, while \"resembles\" is more formal.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the entire phrase \"got what you said\" is replaced with \"understood you\". So this seems like a more direct synonym replacement, but maybe even a different structure. \"Got\" could be replaced with \"understood\", and the structure changes from \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\".\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version by replacing certain words or phrases with their synonyms. Let's see if there's a common thread here.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". \"Fire\" is slang for excellent. The output uses a more descriptive phrase. Similarly, \"made up\" (fabricated) is replaced with a synonym. \"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\". So maybe the instruction is to replace informal or conversational language with more formal or precise terms, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing entire phrases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more positive or affirming statement. For example, \"fire\" implies something is great, so the output is a more explicit positive statement. But the third example doesn't fit that pattern because \"made up\" is negative, and the output is also negative. So that might not be the case.\n\nAnother angle: checking the parts of speech. In the first input, \"fire\" is an adjective (slang), replaced with an adjective phrase \"incredibly good\". Second input, \"many\" (adjective) becomes \"various\" (adjective). Third, \"whole\" (adjective) becomes \"entire\" (adjective), \"made up\" (past participle) becomes \"fabricated\" (past participle). Fourth, \"looks like\" (verb phrase) becomes \"resembles\" (verb). Fifth, \"got what you said\" (verb phrase) becomes \"understood you\" (verb phrase).\n\nSo maybe the instruction is to replace certain adjectives, adverbs, or verb phrases with their synonyms. But why only some words? Let's see:\n\nIn the first input, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So maybe whenever a word is slang or informal, replace it with a more formal synonym. But \"incredibly good\" is still somewhat informal. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more standard form, possibly making it more positive or affirmative.\n\nWait, the second input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So \"many\" becomes \"various\", which is a synonym. The structure remains similar. Third input: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Fourth: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\". Fifth: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to replace common adjectives, adverbs, or phrases with their synonyms, especially when they are part of a set phrase. For example, replacing \"many\" with \"various\", \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", and \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or academic style by replacing informal expressions with their more precise counterparts. For instance, \"fire\" as slang for excellent, replaced with \"incredibly good\". \"Made up\" (fabricated) is replaced with \"fabricated\". \"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles\", which is a more formal term. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\", which is a more direct and formal way of expressing comprehension.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction might involve converting the input into a more positive or affirmative statement. For example, \"This song is fire\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good\" (more positive). \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated\" (still negative, but using a synonym). However, the fifth input's output is \"I understood you\" which is a positive statement, whereas the input was neutral. So that might not be the main focus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more concise or structured form. For example, \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" – removing \"I considered\" and changing \"many\" to \"various\". But that's a structural change, not just a synonym replacement.\n\nWait, looking at the third input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Both \"whole\" and \"made up\" are replaced. So maybe the instruction is to replace any words that are part of a set phrase or idiom with their synonyms. For example, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", \"looks like\" with \"resembles\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or academic tone by replacing informal words with their more precise equivalents. For example, \"fire\" (slang) → \"incredibly good\" (descriptive phrase), \"many\" → \"various\", \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\", \"looks like\" → \"resembles\", \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\".\n\nBut why does \"fire\" become \"incredibly good\"? That's a bit of a stretch. Maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal ones, but in some cases, it's a phrase-to-phrase replacement. For example, \"fire\" is slang for excellent, so the output is a more explicit positive statement. But \"made up\" is a negative phrase, so the output is another negative phrase. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms, regardless of positivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more standard English structure, using more precise vocabulary. For example, replacing \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\" (though that's a bit odd), but maybe the actual instruction is to replace informal adjectives with their more formal equivalents. However, \"incredibly good\" isn't a direct synonym for \"fire\"; \"fire\" is slang for excellent, while \"incredibly good\" is a more literal description.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more positive or affirming statement. For example, \"This song is fire\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good\" (more positive). \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (neutral). \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated\" (negative). \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister\" (neutral). \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\" (positive). So the instruction might be to make the output more positive where possible, but that doesn't explain all cases. For example, the third input's output is also negative, so that can't be the sole reason.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs. In the first input, \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good\". The verb \"is\" remains, but the predicate is changed. In the second input, \"considered\" stays the same. Third input, \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated\". Fourth, \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". Fifth, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\". So the verbs themselves aren't being changed, but the predicates are. So maybe<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let me start by analyzing each pair one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nHmm, comparing these two. The original is a question asking if someone can perform tasks. The output is rephrased using \"would\" and \"be able to accomplish\". So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into conditional statements with \"would\" and \"be able to\"?\n\nBut wait, let's check the next pair to see if this holds. Second input-output:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nWait, here the output is almost the same as the input but replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\". That doesn't fit the first idea. So maybe the instruction isn't about changing questions into conditionals. Maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nThird input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nAgain, similar structure. The original uses \"can't tell the difference\", and the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives? Like replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nHere, the input uses a relative pronoun \"I\" (meaning \"the lawyer that I met\"), and the output changes \"I\" to \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"that\" with \"whom\" when referring to people? But wait, in the input, the clause is \"I met yesterday\", so the antecedent is \"lawyer\". The relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"whom\". Wait, the original uses \"I\", which is the subject. So the correct relative pronoun here would be \"who\" because it's the subject of the clause. But the output uses \"whom\", which is the object form. That seems incorrect. Unless there's a different rule here. Maybe the instruction was to change \"that\" to \"whom\" regardless of the context? Or perhaps the original instruction had a mistake here. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nFifth input-output pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nHere, \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". So again, replacing a common phrase with a synonym. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might involve multiple transformations. Let's list possible patterns:\n\n1. Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\".\n2. Replace \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n3. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses.\n4. Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n5. Convert questions into conditional statements with \"would\" and \"be able to\".\n\nBut wait, the fifth input-output pair is a question converted into a conditional. However, the first input-output pair is a question transformed into a conditional. But the second input is a statement transformed into another statement. So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into conditional statements, but only for questions? Or perhaps the instruction was to make the output more polite or formal by rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using different structures. For example:\n\n- Changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" or \"be unable to\".\n- Replacing contractions with full forms.\n- Using more formal verbs (e.g., \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\", \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference\").\n- Changing \"I\" to \"me\" or \"whom\" in certain contexts.\n- Converting questions into conditional statements with \"would\" and \"be able to\".\n\nBut looking at the first pair, the output is a conditional, while the input is a question. The second input is a statement, output is another statement. Third is a statement, output is another. Fourth is a statement, output is another. Fifth is a statement, output is another. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using different sentence structures. But why does the first input become a conditional? Unless the instruction was specifically to convert questions into conditional statements, but the other inputs were not questions. Wait, the first input is a question, and the output is a conditional. The other inputs are statements, and their outputs are also statements. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a conditional if it's a question, otherwise into a more formal version. But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, but the first input's output is a conditional because of the way the question was phrased.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain phrases with others. For example:\n\n- \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\"\n- \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\"\n- \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n- \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\"\n- \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\"\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to replace those specific phrases with their replacements. But then why does the fourth input-output pair have \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" become \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\"? If the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses, that would make sense. But in the fourth input, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\", where \"I\" is the subject, so the correct relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"that\". But the output uses \"whom\", which is the object form. That seems incorrect unless there's a different rule. Maybe the instruction was to always use \"whom\" in relative clauses, regardless of the context. But that's not grammatically correct. Alternatively, maybe the original instruction had a mistake here, but the user provided the input-output pairs correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"that\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses. But in the fourth input, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\", so the antecedent is \"lawyer\", and the relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"that\". So changing \"I\" to \"whom\" is incorrect. This inconsistency might suggest that the instruction wasn't about replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" but something else. Maybe the instruction was to change the relative pronoun from \"that\" to \"whom\", but in the fourth input, there's no \"that\". Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to change \"that\" to \"whom\" in any relative clause, but the fourth input doesn't have \"that\". This is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the third input-output pair: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Here, the original uses \"can't tell the difference\", and the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". So replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". Similarly, the second input's \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain verb phrases with more formal alternatives. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\", \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\", etc.\n\nThe first input-output pair is a question converted into a conditional. The other pairs are statements converted into other statements. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using different structures. For example, converting questions into conditional statements, but only if they are questions. But the first input is a question, and the output is a conditional. The other inputs are statements, and their outputs are also statements. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using different strategies depending on the type of input. For example:\n\n- Questions: Convert to conditional statements with \"would\" and \"be able to\".\n- Statements: Replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives (like \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\", \"resemble\" instead of \"look like\", etc.).\n\nBut the fourth input is a statement that uses a relative clause, and the output changes \"I\" to \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses. But in the fourth input, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday\", which refers to the lawyer, so the correct relative pronoun should be \"who\" or \"that\". Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" is incorrect. Unless the instruction was to always use \"whom\" in relative clauses, regardless of the context. But that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to change \"that\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses, but in the fourth input, there's no \"that\". This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"that\" with \"whom\" in any relative clause, even if it's not necessary. But that would be incorrect. For example, in the fourth input, \"I met yesterday\" is a relative clause modifying \"lawyer\".<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\nSo here, \"looks like\" was replaced with \"resembles\". Maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with synonyms? But wait, \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like\", but maybe there's more to it. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input-output:\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\nHere, \"whole\" became \"entire\", and \"made up\" became \"fabricated\". So replacing some adjectives or phrases with their more formal equivalents? Or maybe converting informal expressions to more standard ones?\n\nThird example:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nWait, the output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That's changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\". But why would that happen? Maybe the instruction is to convert personal pronouns into their object forms when they follow certain prepositions or clauses? Like turning \"I met\" into \"whom I met\" because \"whom\" is the objective case after \"met\"? But in the original sentence, \"I met\" is part of the relative clause \"I met [lawyer]\". Wait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That seems like changing the subject of the clause. Wait, no—the original clause is \"I met [lawyer]\", which is a relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". The subject here is \"I\", but in the output, it's \"whom\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's used as the subject of a relative clause? But that doesn't make sense because \"I\" is the subject in the original. Wait, maybe the instruction is to convert the subject of the relative clause to the object form? Let me think. In the original sentence, \"I met [lawyer]\" is a relative clause where \"I\" is the subject. If we change \"I\" to \"me\", but the output uses \"whom\". Wait, \"whom\" is the object form. So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in such cases. But why would that be? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to use more formal language, replacing contractions or informal pronouns with their full forms. For example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" to sound more formal. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the possessive pronoun \"my\" to \"mine\", but in this case, there's no possessive. Hmm.\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\nHere, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction is to translate slang or informal expressions into more standard phrasing. \"Fire\" is slang meaning excellent, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\".\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: Thanks for your help.\nOutput: Your assistance is much appreciated.\nThis is a more complex transformation. The input is a simple expression of gratitude, and the output is a more formal response. So perhaps the instruction is to convert casual expressions of thanks into more formal or polite responses. For example, \"thanks\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. Let's list possible transformations:\n\n1. Synonym replacement (like \"looks like\" → \"resembles\")\n2. Formalizing language (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\")\n3. Changing pronouns (e.g., \"I\" → \"whom\") in certain contexts\n4. Replacing slang with more standard phrasing (\"fire\" → \"incredibly good\")\n5. Converting casual expressions into formal responses (\"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance...\")\n\nBut how do these fit under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version. Let's check each example against that idea.\n\nFirst example: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Both are formal, but \"resembles\" is slightly more formal than \"looks like\". So replacing with a synonym that's more formal.\n\nSecond example: \"The whole story...\" → \"The entire story...\". \"Entire\" is more formal than \"whole\". Similarly, \"fabricated\" is a more formal term than \"made up\".\n\nThird example: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". If the instruction is to use more formal language, then using \"whom\" instead of \"I\" might be part of that. But why \"whom\"? Maybe in the context of a relative clause, but the original uses \"I met\", which is correct. Changing to \"whom\" would be incorrect unless there's a specific reason. Wait, maybe the original sentence has a misplaced modifier or requires a different pronoun. Let me parse the original sentence: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer\". The subject of the relative clause is \"I\", which is correct. If we change \"I\" to \"whom\", that would be incorrect because \"whom\" is the object form. Unless the instruction is to convert the subject of the relative clause to the object form, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to avoid using \"I\" in the relative clause. But that's not clear.\n\nFourth example: Slang \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". So replacing informal slang with descriptive adjectives.\n\nFifth example: Casual \"Thanks\" → formal \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nHmm. So the instruction might involve multiple types of transformations. But perhaps the key is that all outputs are more formal or polite versions of the inputs. Let's test that hypothesis.\n\nFirst input-output: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Both are formal, but \"resembles\" is more formal. So replacing with a synonym that's more formal.\n\nSecond input: \"The whole story...\" → \"The entire story...\". Again, more formal terms.\n\nThird input: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". If the instruction is to use more formal language, maybe \"whom\" is considered more formal than \"I\" in certain contexts. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to use a more formal structure, like changing the possessive \"your\" to \"Your\" with a capital letter, but the output here changes \"your\" to \"Your\" and adds \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated\". So that's a different transformation.\n\nFourth example: Slang to formal description.\n\nFifth example: Casual gratitude to formal response.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Both are formal, but \"resembles\" is more formal. So replacing with a synonym that's more formal.\n\nSecond example: \"The whole story...\" → \"The entire story...\". \"Entire\" is more formal than \"whole\".\n\nThird example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday...\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday...\". If the instruction is to use more formal language, maybe changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" is part of that. But why? Unless the original is incorrect, but in standard English, both are correct. However, \"whom\" is the object form, so if the clause is \"whom I met\", then \"whom\" is correct. But in the original, it's \"I met\", which is correct. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to use \"whom\" instead of \"I\" in the relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the subject of the relative clause to the object form, which would be incorrect. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to avoid using \"I\" in the relative clause. For example, changing \"I met\" to \"the person I met\" or something else. But the output here is \"whom I met\", which is still using \"I\". So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to convert the subject of the relative clause to the object form when it's the subject. But that's not a standard rule. Let me check grammar rules. In a relative clause, the subject is usually in the nominative case. For example, \"The lawyer who I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"who\" is the subject. If the instruction is to change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", that would be incorrect because \"whom\" is the object form. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence to use a different structure. For example, changing \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" to \"The<|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction appears to be **to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**. Here's how"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n5. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, I need to identify the rules or patterns that convert each input into the corresponding output. Let's analyze each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first example:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nBreaking down the input: The phrase starts with \"Thanks for your help.\" The output is a more formal or polite response. The key changes here are the subject shift from \"you\" to \"your assistance,\" and the addition of \"is much appreciated.\" So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing gratitude into a more formal expression, possibly using passive voice or different phrasing.\n\nSecond input:\n\"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nHere, the input is a negative statement (\"can't tell\") which is converted into a more neutral or slightly more formal version (\"find it hard to distinguish\"). The structure remains similar, but the wording is adjusted. The verb tense might also be a factor—original is present tense, output uses \"find it hard\" which could be present continuous or present simple. Not sure yet.\n\nThird input:\n\"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\"\nThis seems like a direct rephrasing. The input is a colloquial way of saying \"I understood your message,\" and the output is more formal. The subject shifts from \"you\" to \"me\" (implied), and the verb changes from \"got\" to \"understood.\" Also, the object \"what you said\" becomes \"you\" in the output. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase affirmative statements into more formal or standard English, possibly adjusting pronouns and verb tenses.\n\nFourth input:\n\"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis is a significant change. The original is a negative statement about not thinking something is a good idea. The output is a positive suggestion phrased as a recommendation. The structure here is completely different. The original is a conditional statement (\"don't think it's a good idea to do anything\"), and the output is a suggestion using \"it is suggested that...\" with a negative imperative (\"no action should be taken\"). So perhaps the instruction involves converting negative opinions into positive recommendations or suggestions, possibly restructuring the sentence entirely.\n\nFifth input:\n\"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, the input is a first-person statement expressing an opinion. The output is a more formal way of stating the same idea, using \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\" So the instruction might involve rephrasing personal opinions into a more formal or objective tone, possibly using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think.\"\n\nNow, looking for common elements across all these transformations:\n\n1. **Formality**: All outputs seem more formal than the inputs. For example, \"much appreciated\" vs. \"help,\" \"find it hard\" vs. \"can't tell,\" etc. The outputs use more elevated language.\n\n2. **Pronoun Changes**: In some cases, the subject pronoun changes. For instance, \"you\" becomes \"your assistance\" (first example), \"you\" becomes \"me\" (third example). The fourth example doesn't have a pronoun change but shifts the focus to a suggestion rather than a personal opinion.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure**: The fourth example completely changes the structure from a negative opinion to a positive suggestion. The others maintain a similar structure but adjust wording.\n\n4. **Tense and Modality**: The third example changes \"got\" to \"understood,\" which is a past tense to past tense. The fourth example uses \"suggested\" (past tense) for a recommendation. The first example uses \"assistance is much appreciated\" (present continuous passive).\n\n5. **Redundancy Removal**: The fifth example removes \"that\" after \"opinion,\" but the core meaning remains.\n\nPossible instruction types:\n\n- Convert casual expressions of gratitude into formal thanks.\n- Rephrase negative opinions into positive suggestions.\n- Transform first-person statements into third-person or more formal expressions.\n- Adjust pronouns and verb forms for politeness or formality.\n\nLet me consider possible instructions that could generate these outputs.\n\nOne possibility is that the instruction is to \"politefy\" the input by converting it into a more formal or polite version. However, the fourth example doesn't fit that because it's not just making it polite but changing the content entirely. So that might not be the case.\n\nAnother angle: The fourth example transforms a negative opinion into a positive suggestion. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative thoughts into positive recommendations. But why would the other examples follow that? Let's check:\n\nFirst example: Gratitude → Formal thanks. Doesn't fit the \"negative to positive\" model.\n\nSecond example: Negative (\"can't tell\") → Neutral/positive (\"find it hard to distinguish\"). Hmm, maybe not exactly negative. The second input is a neutral statement, so perhaps the instruction is to rephrase neutral statements into more formal versions.\n\nThird example: Affirmative (\"got what you said\") → Formal \"understood you.\"\n\nFourth example: Negative opinion → Positive suggestion.\n\nFifth example: First-person opinion → Third-person formal opinion.\n\nSo the instruction might involve rephrasing various types of statements into more formal or standardized English, possibly adjusting pronouns, verb tenses, and sentence structures. The fourth example is a bit of an outlier but still fits into the broader theme of rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert certain phrases into more formal equivalents. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" or \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nWait, looking at the fifth example: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So the instruction might be to replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" when expressing an opinion. Similarly, the fourth example replaces \"We don't think\" with \"It is suggested that.\"\n\nBut the fourth example's output isn't just replacing \"think\" with \"suggested\"; it's a complete restructuring. So maybe the instruction is more general: rephrase any expression of doubt or negative opinion into a positive recommendation or suggestion.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert first-person statements into third-person or more formal statements, adjusting pronouns and verb forms accordingly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for common transformations across all examples.\n\nIn the first example, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" The key changes are:\n\n- Subject: \"you\" → \"your assistance\"\n- Verb: \"help\" → \"is appreciated\"\n- Addition of \"much\" and \"is\"\n\nIn the second example, \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish.\" The changes are:\n\n- \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"\n- \"difference\" remains, but the structure is adjusted.\n\nThird example: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Changes include:\n\n- \"got\" → \"understood\"\n- \"what you said\" → \"you\"\n\nFourth example: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This is a major structural change. The original is a negative opinion, and the output is a positive suggestion. The structure is completely different.\n\nFifth example: \"I think that this is interesting\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, \"I think\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion.\"\n\nSo, the instruction might involve several different transformations depending on the input type. For example:\n\n- If the input is a gratitude expression, rephrase it into a more formal thank you.\n- If the input is a negative opinion, rephrase it into a positive suggestion.\n- If the input is an affirmative statement, rephrase it into a more formal version.\n- If the input is a first-person opinion, rephrase it into a third-person formal statement.\n\nBut how to unify these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"convert the given statement into a more formal or polite version, adjusting pronouns and verb tenses as necessary.\" However, the fourth example doesn't fit that, as it's not just polite but also changes the content.\n\nWait, the fourth example's output is not just polite; it's a complete rephrasing into a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase any statement expressing a lack of agreement or negative view into a positive recommendation. But why would the other examples follow that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase any statement into a more formal version,<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. So the instruction must have been something like \"Rewrite the sentence in your own words\" or similar. But maybe there's more nuance here.\n\nLooking at the first example: Input is \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So the output is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Maybe the instruction was to make the statement more polite or formal? Or perhaps to rephrase using different phrasing without changing the meaning.\n\nSecond input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So here, the output is a shorter, more direct rephrasing. Maybe the instruction was to condense the sentence into a more concise form while maintaining the core message.\n\nThird input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This seems like a more formal rephrasing, possibly converting a personal opinion into a suggestion. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more professional tone, using different vocabulary.\n\nFourth input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is rephrased from a present tense (\"do\") to a past tense (\"did\") but in the output, it's changed to \"be able to accomplish,\" which is a common rephrasing. Wait, the original input is \"Can you do...\" and the output is \"Would you be able to...\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the question into a more polite or indirect form, or perhaps to use a different modal verb.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So here, the output uses a synonym for \"look like.\" The instruction might have been to replace certain words with their synonyms or to rephrase using more formal language.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involved rephrasing the input sentences in some way—maybe making them more formal, concise, polite, or using synonyms. Let's check if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more formal or indirect language. For example, \"It is my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" \"understood you\" instead of \"got what you said,\" \"suggested\" instead of \"don't think it's a good idea,\" \"Would you be able\" instead of \"Can you,\" and \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like.\"\n\nSo possible instructions could be:\n1. Rewrite the sentence in a more formal tone.\n2. Rephrase the sentence using synonyms or different structures.\n3. Convert questions into more polite forms (like changing \"can\" to \"would you be able\").\n4. Make the statements more indirect or less direct.\n\nBut the key is that all outputs are rephrased versions. The instruction might have been something like \"Rephrase the following sentences using your own words,\" but with specific nuances. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert questions into requests for confirmation or ability, or to make statements more formal.\n\nWait, looking at the fourth input-output pair: \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" That's a common rephrasing to make the question more polite. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite or indirect form, especially for questions.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the input into a more formal or neutral tone, avoiding contractions or informal expressions.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to translate the input into a more academic or professional style, replacing colloquial terms with more formal ones. For example, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more concise form, removing unnecessary words. Like \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nBut how to connect all these examples under a single instruction? Let's see:\n\nIf the instruction was \"Rewrite the sentence in your own words,\" then all these outputs fit. But maybe there's a specific aspect emphasized. For instance, the third example changes \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"it is suggested,\" which is a more formal way of presenting an opinion as a suggestion rather than a personal view. Similarly, the fourth example changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite form.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been \"Convert the following statements into questions seeking confirmation,\" but that doesn't fit the first example. The first input is a statement, output is also a statement.\n\nWait, the first input is a statement, output is a statement. The second is a statement to a question. Third is a statement to a suggestion. Fourth is a question to another question. Fifth is a statement to a statement with a synonym.\n\nHmm. So the instruction isn't necessarily about turning statements into questions or vice versa. It's about rephrasing in general.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example:\n\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\"\n- \"We don't think\" → \"It is suggested\"\n- \"Can you do\" → \"Would you be able to\"\n- \"She looks like\" → \"She resembles\"\n\nSo the outputs often use different phrasing but maintain the same meaning. The instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or neutral tone, using synonyms or different structures.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to make the sentences more indirect or polite. For example, changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" is a way to make the request more polite.\n\nBut why would the third example change \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"it is suggested\"? That's a more formal way of presenting an opinion as a suggestion rather than a personal view. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase opinions into suggestions or recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, replacing contractions and informal expressions with more formal alternatives.\n\nGiven that all outputs seem to be rephrased versions with varying degrees of formality and structure, the most likely instruction is something like \"Rewrite the sentence in your own words, using more formal language where appropriate,\" or \"Rephrase each sentence to make it more polite or indirect.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's check if there's a common element across all outputs. For example:\n\n- All outputs avoid contractions (e.g., \"I think\" vs. \"It is my opinion\")\n- Some use more formal verbs (e.g., \"understood\" instead of \"got\")\n- Others use different sentence structures (e.g., \"It is suggested\" vs. \"We don't think\")\n- Synonyms are used (e.g., \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\")\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase the input sentences into more formal, neutral, or polite language, possibly using synonyms or different structures. The exact wording could vary, but the key is that the outputs are rephrased versions with these characteristics.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was likely **\"Rewrite the sentence in your own words, using more formal language where appropriate.\"** \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Formalization**: Outputs often replace informal expressions (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\") with more formal phrasing.\n2. **Politeness**: Questions like \"Can you...\" are rephrased to \"Would you be able to...\" for politeness.\n3. **Synonym Replacement**: Words like \"resembles\" (instead of \"looks like\") or \"understood\" (instead of \"got\") are used.\n4. **Structural Changes**: Sentences are restructured (e.g., \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\").\n\nThis instruction emphasizes rephrasing to enhance clarity, formality, or politeness while preserving the original meaning.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a more formal or polite version of the statement. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nFirst input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So here, the original is a negative statement about not doing anything, but the output is phrased as a suggestion. That suggests maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The original uses \"once you get there,\" which is a bit informal, and the output uses \"upon your arrival,\" which sounds more formal. So maybe the instruction was to make the language more formal or polite by replacing certain phrases with more formal equivalents.\n\nThird input: \"See you tonight.\" Output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the task was to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite alternatives.\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" The original is first-person, while the output is third-person. Also, \"considered\" becomes \"were considered.\" Maybe the instruction was to rephrase in the passive voice or third person.\n\nFifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output is \"Shall I accompany you?\" The original is a question using \"do you want,\" and the output uses \"shall I,\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or agreement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase questions into more formal or polite interrogative forms, possibly using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to.\"\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves transforming the given inputs into more formal, polite, or professional versions. Each output seems to take the original statement and rephrase it using more formal language structures, such as passive voice, suggestions (using \"it is suggested\"), polite questions (\"shall I\"), and formal greetings.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a common thread. For example, the first output uses \"suggested,\" the second uses \"upon your arrival,\" third uses \"look forward to,\" fourth uses passive voice, fifth uses \"shall I.\" All these transformations aim to make the language more formal or polite. So the instruction might have been something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language structures such as passive voice, suggestions, polite questions, etc.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the inputs into more formal English by replacing certain phrases with their more formal equivalents. For instance, changing \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"is suggested,\" \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival,\" etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with a more formal greeting or phrase. For example, \"It is suggested...\" starts with a formal structure. Similarly, \"Please call upon your arrival\" uses \"upon your arrival\" which is more formal than \"once you get there.\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the inputs into more formal English, possibly using more elevated vocabulary or sentence structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the inputs into more polite or formal versions by using different verb tenses or structures. For example, \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice), which is a common way to make statements more formal.\n\nLooking at the fifth input/output pair: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a classic example of converting a question from the first person to the second person using \"shall I,\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or agreement.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction probably was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version of the statement. The key elements would involve using more formal language structures, such as passive voice, suggestions (using \"it is suggested\"), polite questions (\"shall I\"), and formal greetings or expressions.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was likely something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language structures such as passive voice, suggestions, polite questions, and formal expressions.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, utilizing appropriate language structures such as:\n\n1. **Passive Voice**: Convert active sentences to passive to emphasize actions rather than subjects (e.g., \"Various approaches were considered\" from \"I considered many approaches\").\n2. **Suggestive Phrasing**: Replace direct statements with polite recommendations (e.g., \"It is suggested that no action should be taken\" from \"We don't think it's a good idea...\").\n3. **Formal Greetings/Expressions**: Replace casual phrases with more formal alternatives (e.g., \"I look forward to meeting you\" from \"See you tonight\").\n4. **Polite Questions**: Use formal interrogatives like \"Shall I...\" instead of informal \"Do you want me to...\" (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" from \"Do you want me to go with you?\").\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, employing passive voice, suggestive phrasing, formal greetings, and polite questions.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

So maybe the instruction is to replace adjectives or nouns related to completeness with their synonyms, and verbs indicating creation with their synonyms?\n\nThird input:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nWait, the output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So perhaps the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses using \"whom\"? Or maybe it's about changing the structure from subject-verb to a relative clause?\n\nFourth input:\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\nHere, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches\" and the verb phrase is inverted. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence structure, like changing the subject and verb order, and replacing some adjectives or nouns with synonyms?\n\nFifth input:\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\nThis seems like a complete rephrasing of the sentence. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal or different structure, possibly using synonyms or different tenses?\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might be something like \"Rewrite the sentence using synonyms and restructuring where possible.\" But let's check if that fits all cases.\n\nFirst example: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\". Both are similar but phrased differently. So replacing a phrase with a synonym phrase.\n\nSecond example: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". These are direct synonyms. So replacing adjectives/nouns with their synonyms.\n\nThird example: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". Wait, the original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the possessive \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". That's a change in the relative clause structure. So maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses using \"whom\"?\n\nFourth example: \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various\", and the subject-verb order is inverted. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence structure, invert subject and verb, and replace some adjectives with synonyms.\n\nFifth example: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" This is a complete rephrasing, changing the verb and the object. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal or different structure, possibly using synonyms or different tenses.\n\nBut wait, the fifth example changes the entire sentence structure. The first example only changes part of the sentence. So maybe the instruction is more general: \"Rewrite the sentence using synonyms and restructuring as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or grammatically correct versions. For example, the third input uses \"whom\" which is more formal than \"I met\". The fourth example inverts the subject and verb, which is a common restructuring technique. The fifth example changes \"got what you said\" to \"understood you,\" which is a more direct and formal rephrasing.\n\nAnother angle: checking if the outputs are more concise or use different parts of speech. For instance, \"upon your arrival\" is a prepositional phrase, whereas \"once you get there\" is a time clause. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain temporal expressions with others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they might be using different tenses. For example, the first input is present tense, output is present. Second is past tense input (\"was made up\") becomes past tense output (\"was fabricated\"). Third is past tense input (\"was helpful\") remains past tense. Fourth is present perfect (\"I considered\") becomes past passive (\"were considered\"). Fifth is present tense input (\"I got\") becomes past tense (\"understood\").\n\nHmm, so the tense might not be a consistent factor. Let's see:\n\n1. Input: present tense (Please call once you get there). Output: present tense (Please call upon your arrival).\n\n2. Input: past tense (The whole story was made up). Output: past tense (The entire story was fabricated).\n\n3. Input: past tense (The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful). Output: past tense (The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful).\n\n4. Input: past perfect (\"I considered many approaches\"). Output: past passive (\"Various approaches were considered\").\n\n5. Input: past tense (\"I got what you said\"). Output: past tense (\"I understood you\").\n\nSo the tense doesn't seem to be a key factor. The fourth example changes the tense structure (past perfect to past passive), but others stay the same.\n\nLooking back at the outputs:\n\n1. \"upon your arrival\" vs \"once you get there\": both are about timing, but phrased differently.\n\n2. \"entire\" vs \"whole\": synonyms.\n\n3. \"whom\" vs \"I met\": changing the possessive to a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\n4. \"various\" vs \"many\": synonyms.\n\n5. \"understood you\" vs \"got what you said\": rephrasing the entire sentence, changing the verb and the object.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the sentence using synonyms and restructuring where possible. But how does that apply to all cases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms and adjust the sentence structure accordingly. For example:\n\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n- Change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n- Replace \"many approaches\" with \"various approaches\" and invert the subject-verb.\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nBut this seems too case-specific. Maybe there's a more general rule.\n\nWait, looking at the third example: \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". So the possessive pronoun \"I\" is replaced with \"whom\". That's a change in the relative clause structure. So maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses using \"whom\"?\n\nBut then why does the second example not do that? The second input is \"The whole story was made up.\" The output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" No change to the possessive. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more formal style, using different structures and synonyms. For example:\n\n- Use \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\".\n- Use \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\".\n- Use \"whom\" to make the relative clause more formal.\n- Use \"various\" instead of \"many\" and invert the subject-verb.\n- Use \"understood you\" instead of \"got what you said\".\n\nBut how to generalize this into an instruction?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the transformations.\n\n1. First input: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\". Both are about arriving, but phrased differently. So replacing a phrase with a synonym phrase.\n\n2. Second input: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Direct synonyms.\n\n3. Third input: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\". Changing the possessive to a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\n4. Fourth input: \"many approaches\" → \"various approaches\", \"considered\" → \"were considered\". Inverting subject and verb, replacing \"many\" with \"various\".\n\n5. Fifth input: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\". Entirely rephrasing the sentence, changing the verb and the object.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite the sentence using synonyms and restructuring where possible, such as replacing phrases with their synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and converting possessives to relative clauses with 'whom' when appropriate.\"\n\nBut maybe there's a more concise way. Alternatively, the instruction might be to rephrase the sentence into a more formal version, using different vocabulary and structures. For example, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, adjusting word order, etc.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs are often more formal or use different parts of speech. For instance, \"upon your arrival\" is a prepositional phrase, whereas \"once you get there\" is a time clause. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain temporal expressions with others.\n\nBut the first example does that, but the second example doesn't. So that might not be the main factor.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs seem to have more varied sentence structures. For example, the third input becomes a relative clause with \"whom\", the fourth inverts subject and verb, the fifth<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\nInputs:\n1. Can you do all these tasks?\n2. We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\n3. See you tonight.\n4. I can't stand his temper.\n5. She looks like her sister.\n\nOutputs:\n1. Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n2. It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n3. I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n4. I cannot tolerate his temper.\n5. She resembles her sister.\n\nHmm. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair. The input is a question asking if the person can perform certain tasks. The output is a rephrased question using \"be able to\" instead of \"do,\" and changing \"tasks\" to \"accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? But wait, the second input is a statement, not a question. Let's check the second pair.\n\nSecond input is a negative statement about not thinking it's a good idea to act. The output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested...\" So perhaps the instruction is to convert statements into suggestions or recommendations? But the third input is a greeting, which becomes a more formal expression of looking forward to seeing them. Fourth input is a complaint (\"can't stand his temper\") becoming \"cannot tolerate,\" which is similar in meaning but slightly different wording. Fifth input is a similarity observation (\"looks like\") becoming \"resembles,\" which is a synonym.\n\nWait, so maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version? Let's check each example:\n\n1. Input: Can you... Output: Would you be able to... (more polite)\n2. Input: We don't think... Output: It is suggested... (more formal, using \"suggested\")\n3. Input: See you... Output: I look forward to meeting you... (more formal, changing \"see\" to \"look forward to\")\n4. Input: I can't stand... Output: I cannot tolerate... (same meaning, just different phrasing)\n5. Input: She looks like... Output: She resembles... (synonym)\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using synonyms or different structures. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nFor the first input, changing \"Can you\" to \"Would you be able to\" makes it more polite. The second input changes \"We don't think\" to \"It is suggested,\" which is a more formal way to present an opinion. Third input turns a casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. Fourth input replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a synonym. Fifth input uses \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like.\"\n\nIf the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, then all these examples fit. However, let's check if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements, but the first input is a question and the output is also a question, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more positive? But the fourth input is a complaint, and the output is still a complaint, just phrased differently. So that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used. For example, \"can\" vs. \"be able to,\" \"think\" vs. \"suggest,\" \"stand\" vs. \"tolerate,\" \"look like\" vs. \"resemble.\" These are all synonyms or similar in meaning but phrased differently. So the instruction might be to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal or professional tone. Let's see:\n\n1. From \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" – more polite.\n2. From \"We don't think...\" to \"It is suggested...\" – more formal.\n3. From \"See you...\" to \"I look forward to meeting you...\" – more formal and positive.\n4. From \"I can't stand...\" to \"I cannot tolerate...\" – same meaning but different phrasing.\n5. From \"She looks like...\" to \"She resembles...\" – synonym replacement.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. So the instruction could be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let's check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements, but the first input is a question and the output is a question, so that's not it. Or maybe to convert statements into questions, but the second input is a statement and the output is a question. That doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more positive. But the fourth input is a complaint, and the output is still a complaint. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to use a different verb tense. Let's check:\n\n1. Input: present tense (Can you). Output: present tense (Would you be able to).\n2. Input: present tense (We don't think). Output: present tense (It is suggested).\n3. Input: present tense (See you). Output: present tense (I look forward to meeting you).\n4. Input: present tense (I can't stand). Output: present tense (I cannot tolerate).\n5. Input: present tense (She looks like). Output: present tense (She resembles).\n\nNo change in tense here. So that's not the case.\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" So the original statement is turned into a suggestion. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a suggestion or recommendation. But the first input is a question, which isn't a suggestion. So that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nThird input-output pair: \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction was to convert greetings into expressions of looking forward to meeting someone.\n\nBut the first input is a question, the second is a statement, the fourth is a complaint, the fifth is a similarity observation. So the instruction must cover various types of inputs. Therefore, the most general instruction would be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using synonyms or different phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more positive or encouraging response. But the fourth input is a complaint, and the output is still a complaint. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in the outputs compared to inputs. For example:\n\n- \"Can\" → \"Would you be able to\" (different structure)\n- \"don't think\" → \"is suggested\" (different structure)\n- \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (different structure)\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (same structure, different verb)\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (same structure, different verb)\n\nSo the structure varies. Some outputs have different sentence structures, others use synonyms. So the instruction might involve both changing the structure and replacing words.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using synonyms or different phrasing. This seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet me check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a question. But the first input is already a question, and the second input is a statement, which becomes a question. That doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more indirect. For example, the second input's output is a suggestion rather than a direct statement. But the first input's output is also a question, which is a form of indirectness. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal or professional tone. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal language, etc. Let's see:\n\n1. \"Can you\" → \"Would you be able to\" – more polite.\n2. \"We don't think\" → \"It is suggested\" – more formal.\n3. \"See you\" → \"I look forward to meeting you\" – more formal.\n4. \"I can't stand\" → \"I cannot tolerate\" – same meaning but more formal.\n5. \"She looks like\" → \"She resembles\" – synonym replacement.\n\nYes, this fits. So the instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more positive or encouraging tone. But the fourth input is a complaint, and the output is still a complaint. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the second input-output pair, the original is a statement expressing doubt about acting now, and the output is a suggestion to not take action. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a suggestion or recommendation. But the first input is a question, which<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to determine what the initial instruction was. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied to each input to get the output.\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, let's analyze each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\n- The original sentence starts with \"I think...\" and the output changes it to \"It is my opinion that...\". So here, the subject is shifted from \"I\" to \"It\", and the verb phrase is rephrased using \"is my opinion that\".\n\nSecond input-output:\n- Original is a question starting with \"Do you...\", and the output is a more formal version using \"Shall I accompany you?\". The structure here is changing the question into a suggestion phrased as a third-person imperative.\n\nThird input:\n- \"I got what you said.\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object \"what you said\" is simplified to \"you\".\n\nFourth input:\n- \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" The adjective \"fire\" is replaced with a more elaborate description. \"Fire\" is slang for something really good, so the output uses a more formal equivalent.\n\nFifth input:\n- \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The original is a negative statement about not being able to differentiate, and the output rephrases it using \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's categorize possible instruction types:\n\n1. **Rephrasing for Formality**: Some outputs seem more formal. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" or \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\". But not all inputs are made more formal—like the third input where \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", which might be more direct but not necessarily formal.\n\n2. **Replacing Slang/Colloquialisms**: The fourth input's \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\", which is a more standard adjective. Similarly, maybe other informal expressions are being converted to more formal terms.\n\n3. **Changing Sentence Structure**: The first input changes the subject and adds \"my opinion\", while the second input changes the question into a suggestion phrased as a command. The fifth input changes the negative structure into a different phrasing.\n\nWait, but the third input doesn't change the structure much. It just replaces \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". Maybe that's a simplification rather than a structural change.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in the outputs. For example, \"think\" becomes \"opinion\", \"want\" becomes \"accompany\", \"got\" becomes \"understood\", \"is fire\" becomes \"is incredibly good\", \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. Let's check:\n\n- First input: Changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" could be seen as making it more formal. Similarly, the second input's \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a more polite way to ask for permission or agreement. Third input: \"I got what you said\" is a bit informal; replacing with \"I understood you\" is more direct but maybe less formal. Fourth input: \"fire\" is slang, replaced with a more descriptive term. Fifth input: \"can't tell the difference\" is rephrased into a more formal expression.\n\nBut some of these don't fit the \"formal\" category. For example, the third input's output is more direct but not necessarily formal. So maybe the instruction isn't strictly about formality.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: \"fire\" is slang for excellent. The output uses \"incredibly good\", which is a more standard way to express high quality. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal or slang expressions with more formal or standard equivalents.\n\nSimilarly, the first input's output uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\", which might be considered more formal. The second input's output is a more polite way to ask someone to go along. The fifth input's output is a more formal way to express difficulty distinguishing.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, replacing informal expressions with their more standard equivalents. Alternatively, it could be to translate the input into a more formal register, adjusting vocabulary and sentence structure accordingly.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" – formal rephrasing.\n2. \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" – polite request.\n3. \"I got...\" → \"I understood...\" – more direct but maybe slightly more formal.\n4. \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with standard adjective.\n5. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – formal rephrasing.\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The instruction likely asked the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction could be to convert questions into statements or vice versa, but looking at the examples, only the second input is a question, and its output is a statement. However, the first input is a statement becoming another statement, third is a statement to another statement, fourth is a statement to another statement, fifth is a statement to another statement. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make each input more assertive. For example, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\", which is more assertive. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a suggestion rather than a question. \"I got...\" becomes \"I understood...\", which is more direct. \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\", which is a stronger assertion. \"Can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a more formal way of expressing inability.\n\nSo the key here is that the instruction required the friend to rephrase each input into a more assertive or formal version, possibly replacing informal expressions with more standard ones. Therefore, the original instruction was likely something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version**, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents. This explains the observed transformations across all input-output pairs:\n\n1. **Formalization**:  \n   - \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\" (assertive rephrasing).  \n   - \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (polite suggestion).  \n\n2. **Slang Replacement**:  \n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (standard adjective).  \n\n3. **Directness and Formality**:  \n   - \"I got...\" → \"I understood...\" (slightly more direct).  \n   - \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" (formal rephrasing).  \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or assertive version, replacing informal or slang terms with their standard equivalents.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3.

Let's analyze each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a sentence expressing gratitude. The output rephrases it using more formal language (\"assistance\" instead of \"help\"), adds \"is much appreciated,\" and changes the subject from \"you\" to \"your assistance.\" So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing in a more formal tone, possibly changing the perspective (from second person to third person) and adding adjectives or phrases like \"much appreciated.\"\n\nSecond input: A question asking if the speaker should go along. The output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way of suggesting accompaniment. So perhaps the instruction is to convert questions into polite requests, using different phrasing like \"Shall I\" instead of \"Do you want me to,\" and changing the verb structure.\n\nThird input: A statement about considering multiple approaches. The output uses \"Various approaches were considered\" instead of \"I considered many approaches.\" Here, the subject shifts from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and \"many\" becomes \"various.\" Also, the past tense remains the same, but the structure changes. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a passive voice or a more formal version, replacing \"I\" with a more general subject.\n\nFourth input: A statement expressing difficulty in distinguishing two things. The output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference.\" The structure here is changed from a negative present tense to a more formal present participle phrase. So perhaps the instruction involves converting negative statements into positive phrasings, using \"find it hard to\" instead of \"can't,\" and adjusting the preposition from \"between these two\" to \"between them.\"\n\nFifth input: A statement expressing inability to tolerate someone's temper. The output changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" So here, the instruction might involve replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, specifically changing \"can't\" to \"cannot\" and adjusting the phrasing slightly.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's categorize the changes:\n\n1. **Formal vs. Informal Language**: Many outputs use more formal terms (e.g., \"assistance\" instead of \"help,\" \"accompany\" instead of \"go with you\"). This suggests the instruction might be to rephrase sentences in a more formal tone.\n\n2. **Subject Shift**: In some cases, the subject changes from \"I\" to a more general subject (like \"Your assistance,\" \"Various approaches,\" \"I\"). For example, in the first input, \"I\" becomes \"Your assistance,\" which is a shift in perspective. Similarly, the third input changes \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a passive voice construction.\n\n3. **Rephrasing Questions**: The second input's question is converted into a polite request using \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want me to go with you?\" So the instruction might include converting questions into requests with different phrasing.\n\n4. **Negative to Positive**: The fourth input changes \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more positive phrasing. Similarly, the fifth input replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal negation.\n\n5. **Preposition Adjustments**: The fourth input's preposition changes from \"between these two\" to \"between them,\" which might be part of a broader adjustment in phrasing.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version. Let's check if these examples fit a common instruction like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal and polite tone, adjusting the subject, verb forms, and phrasing as needed.\"\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. Original: Gratitude becomes formal and adds \"is much appreciated.\"\n2. Question becomes a polite request with \"Shall I...\"\n3. Active voice with \"I\" becomes passive or third-person perspective.\n4. Negative present tense becomes a more formal expression.\n5. Informal \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nYes, this seems to fit. Another possible angle is that the instruction might be to convert each input into a more formal version, possibly using different sentence structures, polite language, and adjusting pronouns and verb tenses.\n\nAlternatively, could it be about translating into another language? But the outputs don't seem to be translations; they're rephrased in English. For example, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is a rephrasing, not a translation.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal version by replacing contractions, changing subject pronouns, and using more formal verbs. For instance, \"I can't tell\" becomes \"I find it hard to,\" which is a common way to express difficulty formally.\n\nSo, synthesizing all these observations, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal and polite tone, adjusting the subject, verb forms, and phrasing as necessary.\"\n\nLet me verify this with each example:\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: Formal and polite, using \"Your assistance\" and \"is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: Question → Polite request with \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: Active voice with \"I\" → Passive or third-person perspective (\"Various approaches were considered\").\n4. Input: Negative present → \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n5. Input: Informal \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nAll fit. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting various elements like subject, verb form, and phrasing.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite tone**, adjusting elements such as subject perspective, verb forms, and phrasing. Specifically, the task involved:\n\n1. **Replacing contractions** (e.g., \"can't\" → \"cannot\").\n2. **Changing subject pronouns** (e.g., \"I\" to \"Your assistance\").\n3. **Using formal verbs** (e.g., \"accompany\" instead of \"go with you\").\n4. **Rephrasing questions** into polite requests (e.g., \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n5. **Adjusting sentence structure** (e.g., active to passive voice).\n\nThis systematic transformation aligns with the provided input-output pairs, ensuring each response is both formal and courteous.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. My job is to determine the general rule or instruction that the friend followed to transform each input into its corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\nInputs:\n1. I considered many approaches.\n2. Thanks for your help.\n3. She looks like her sister.\n4. See you tonight.\n5. I got what you said.\n\nOutputs:\n1. Various approaches were considered.\n2. Your assistance is much appreciated.\n3. She resembles her sister.\n4. I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n5. I understood you.\n\nLooking at these, I notice that some outputs are more formal or polite than the inputs. For example, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Similarly, \"See you tonight\" turns into \"I look forward to meeting you tonight,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. \n\nAnother observation is that some outputs use synonyms or slightly different phrasing. Like \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" is replaced with \"various,\" but the structure remains similar. However, in the third input, \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister,\" where \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like.\"\n\nWait, but not all outputs are direct synonyms. Let's check each pair:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" and the sentence structure is slightly changed but maintains the same meaning.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a more formal way of thanking someone. The original is informal, the output is more polite.\n\n3. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Using \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal or precise.\n\n4. Input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a change from a casual greeting to a more formal expression of anticipation.\n\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the output is a more concise and direct statement of understanding, whereas the input is a bit more colloquial.\n\nSo, the instruction might be something like \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version while maintaining the original meaning.\" But let's check if that's consistent across all examples.\n\nFor example, the first input is already somewhat formal, but the output is even more formal. The second input is informal, and the output is very polite. The third input uses \"looks like,\" which is common, but the output uses \"resembles,\" which is more formal. The fourth input is a casual greeting, and the output is a formal expression of looking forward. The fifth input is a colloquial way of saying \"understood,\" and the output is a more direct statement.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal or professional tone. Alternatively, it could be about replacing certain phrases with their synonyms. Let's see:\n\n- \"considered many approaches\" → \"various approaches were considered\": \"many\" → \"various,\" and the structure changes from \"I did X\" to \"X were considered.\" Wait, no—the original is \"I considered many approaches,\" and the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject is still \"approaches,\" but the verb is passive (\"were considered\") and the subject is plural. The original is active voice with \"I\" as the subject. Hmm, maybe the instruction was to make the sentence passive? But then why does the third input become \"She resembles her sister\"? That's not passive. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" The output is more formal. The original is already somewhat formal, but the output is even more so. So this fits.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Definitely more formal and polite.\n\n3. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Using \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\" makes it more formal. Also, the original is a simple statement, and the output is slightly more descriptive.\n\n4. Input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Changing from a casual greeting to a formal expression of anticipation. The output is more polite and anticipatory.\n\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The output is a more direct and concise statement of understanding, which is more formal than the input's colloquial phrasing.\n\nSo, the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. But wait, let's check if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms. Let's see:\n\n- \"considered\" → \"were considered\" (passive voice), but that doesn't fit all cases. For example, the third input's output isn't passive. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to make the sentences more positive or affirming. For example, \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a positive response. \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is also positive. But the first input's output is more formal but not necessarily positive. So that might not be the main focus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal or professional tone. Let's see how that applies:\n\n- \"I considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" The output is more formal and uses \"various\" instead of \"many,\" which is a slight difference but maintains the meaning.\n\n- \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a clear upgrade in formality and politeness.\n\n- \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Again, more formal.\n\n- \"See you tonight\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Formal and anticipatory.\n\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" More direct and formal.\n\nSo, the instruction seems to be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. But let's check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more positive or to use more positive language. However, the first input's output isn't particularly positive, just more formal. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms. For example, \"considered\" → \"various approaches were considered,\" but that's not exactly a synonym. Wait, \"considered many approaches\" vs. \"various approaches were considered.\" The original is active voice with \"I,\" the output is passive voice with \"were considered.\" So that's a structural change. But in the third input, \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister,\" which is a synonym. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"look like\" with \"resemble,\" but that's only one example. The first input's output uses \"various\" instead of \"many,\" which is a synonym but not exactly the same part of speech. So that might not be the case.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs seem to be more formal and polite. So the instruction could be \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version.\" Let's test this against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" The output is more formal. The original is already formal, but the output is even more so. So this fits.\n\n2. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" More formal and polite.\n\n3. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" More formal.\n\n4. Input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" More formal and polite.\n\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" More direct and formal.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version. However, let's check if there's any other possible instruction that could explain all the transformations.\n\nWait, another thought: The outputs sometimes change the subject. For example, the first input's subject is \"I,\" but the output is \"Various approaches.\" The third input's subject is \"She,\" and the output is \"She.\" The fourth input's subject is \"you,\" and the output is \"I.\" So the subjects can change. For instance, \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the subject shifts from \"you\" to \"I.\" Similarly, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" changing the subject from \"you\" to \"I.\" So maybe the instruction involved changing the subject or perspective?\n\nBut in the first example, the subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches.\" That's a significant shift.

Hmm, each input has a corresponding output, so I need to look for patterns or transformations between them.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". That seems like replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and changing \"you get there\" to \"your arrival\". Maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases or use specific prepositions.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nWait, here the output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So maybe the instruction involves changing the relative pronoun from \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? But wait, in the input, it's \"I met\", and the output uses \"whom I met\". But why would that be? Unless the original instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", but that doesn't make sense because \"whom\" is more formal and usually used as the object of a verb or preposition. Maybe the input had a different structure. Wait, looking at the input again: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". But why? Unless the original instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" when the subject is the person being referred to. But that seems too specific. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" before the clause if it's a relative clause. But in this case, the input already has \"I met\", which is a past tense verb phrase. Maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in such contexts. But that's a bit odd. Maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nThird input-output pair:\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\nSo \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\". Fire is slang for something cool or awesome. The output is a more formal rephrasing. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more standard phrasing. For example, replacing slang terms with their literal meanings or more appropriate adjectives.\n\nFourth example:\nInput: Do you want me to go with you?\nOutput: Shall I accompany you?\nHere, \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the question is transformed into a more formal or old-fashioned phrasing. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", and \"go with you\" becomes \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to\".\n\nFifth input-output pair:\nInput: I got what you said.\nOutput: I understood you.\nSo \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\". The meaning is similar, but the phrasing is changed. \"Got\" here is slang for understanding. The output uses a more direct verb. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more standard verbs or phrases.\n\nNow, putting all these together, what could the original instruction be? Let's see:\n\n1. The first example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". So replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and adjusting the rest. Maybe the instruction was to replace \"once\" with \"upon\" in certain contexts.\n\n2. The second example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". But that's not a general rule. Unless the instruction was to add \"whom\" when referring to oneself in a relative clause. But that's not a common rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in cases where the subject is the person being referred to. But that seems too specific.\n\n3. Third example: replacing slang (\"fire\") with a more formal description (\"incredibly good\"). So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more standard or descriptive language.\n\n4. Fourth example: converting questions starting with \"do you want\" into \"shall I...\" and changing the verb phrase. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase questions into more formal or old-fashioned phrasing using \"shall I\".\n\n5. Fifth example: replacing \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\". So replacing \"got\" (slang for understand) with \"understood\". Maybe the instruction was to replace informal verbs with their standard counterparts.\n\nLooking for a common thread here. Let's see:\n\n- The first example uses \"upon your arrival\" which is a more formal way of saying \"when you arrive\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"once you [verb]\" with \"upon your [gerund]\". For example, \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\".\n\n- The second example adds \"whom\" before the clause. But why? Unless the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" when the subject is the person being addressed. But that's not a standard rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to insert \"whom\" in relative clauses where the subject is the speaker. But that's not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check the outputs:\n\nFirst output: \"Please call upon your arrival\" is more formal than \"once you get there\".\n\nSecond output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\" uses \"whom\" which is more formal.\n\nThird output: \"This song is incredibly good\" is more formal than \"fire\".\n\nFourth output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" is more formal than \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\n\nFifth output: \"I understood you\" is more formal than \"I got what you said\".\n\nSo all outputs seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone. But how exactly?\n\nBut let's check the second example again. The input was \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only difference is adding \"whom\". Why would that be? If the instruction was to make the sentence more formal, adding \"whom\" might be part of that. But \"whom\" is typically used as the object of a verb or preposition. In this case, \"whom I met\" is the object of \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in such cases. But that's a very specific rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" when it's a relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. For example, \"I met the man who/whom I saw yesterday\" – both are correct, but \"whom\" is more formal. So perhaps the instruction was to use \"whom\" in such relative clauses. But the input here is \"I met\", which is the subject of the verb \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" after the verb when it's a relative clause. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in any case where it's a relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. For example, \"The man I met yesterday\" vs. \"The man whom I met yesterday\" – both are correct, but the latter is more formal. So perhaps the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by using \"whom\" in such cases. But the input here is \"I met\", which is the subject of the verb \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" after the verb when it's a relative clause. But that's not a general rule. It's possible that the input had a different structure. Wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause starts with \"I met\". So maybe the instruction was to convert \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in such relative clauses. But that's a very specific transformation. However, in the output, it's \"whom I met\", which is more formal. So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" in relative clauses. But that's not a standard rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" after the verb when it's a relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. For example, \"I met the man whom I saw yesterday\" is correct, but \"I met the man I saw yesterday\" is also correct. So maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by using \"whom\" in such cases. But that's a stylistic choice, not a grammatical rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal tone, which would explain the other examples. For instance:\n\n- First example: \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival\" (more formal).\n\n- Second example: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (more formal).\n\n- Third example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (more formal).\n\n- Fourth example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n4. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n5. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nLet me analyze each pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair. The original sentence is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion. The output rephrases it using \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a more formal or indirect way, perhaps by removing the first-person perspective and using a more objective tone. But wait, the second input is a question, and the output changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\". That seems like changing the phrasing of the question from a direct request to a more polite or tentative form. Similarly, the third input is a request to call when arriving, and the output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is a more formal or traditional phrasing. The fourth input is a past tense statement about considering approaches, and the output uses \"Various approaches were considered\" which is a slightly different structure but maintaining the meaning. The fifth input is a simple expression of gratitude, and the output rephrases it into a more elaborate form.\n\nLooking at all these transformations, there might be multiple possible instructions. Let's consider possible commonalities:\n\n1. Changing the perspective from first person (I) to third person (It is my opinion) in the first example.\n2. Changing questions into more polite forms (Can you... → Would you be able to...).\n3. Replacing informal expressions with more formal ones (call once you get there → call upon your arrival).\n4. Restructuring sentences to use passive voice or different verb tenses (considered many approaches → various approaches were considered).\n5. Rephrasing gratitude into more elaborate expressions (thanks for your help → your assistance is much appreciated).\n\nBut how do these fit under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, possibly adjusting the tone, perspective, or structure. Alternatively, it could be about converting statements into questions or vice versa, but looking at the examples, some are statements becoming questions (like the first input is a statement, output is a statement; the second input is a question, output is a question). Wait, no—the second input is a question, output is also a question. So maybe not converting between question and statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, such as replacing contractions, changing pronouns, adjusting sentence structure, etc. Let's check each example:\n\n1. Original: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\" So replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\". This could be part of making the statement more indirect or formal.\n2. Original: \"Can you...\" → Output: \"Would you be able to...\". Here, the question is rephrased using \"would be able to\" instead of \"can\", which is a more polite and less direct way of asking.\n3. Original: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The phrase \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal or traditional expression.\n4. Original: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" This seems like restructuring the sentence to use passive voice (\"were considered\" instead of \"considered\"), which might make it more objective or formal.\n5. Original: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the gratitude is rephrased into a more elaborate and formal expression.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, indirect, or polite version. Possible elements include:\n\n- Converting first-person statements into third-person or collective pronouns (e.g., \"It is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\").\n- Changing questions into more polite forms (using \"would be able to\" instead of \"can you\").\n- Replacing informal expressions with more formal alternatives (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\").\n- Restructuring sentences to use passive voice or different verb tenses (e.g., present perfect active to passive).\n- Transforming direct gratitude into more elaborate expressions of thanks.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with \"It is my opinion\" for the first input, which is a common way to express someone else's view rather than the speaker's own. The second input's output uses \"Would you be able to...\", which is a more tentative and polite way of asking. The third input's output uses a more formal phrasing. The fourth input's output uses passive voice, which can make the sentence more objective. The fifth input's output expands the gratitude into a longer phrase.\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, indirect, or polite version by adjusting the perspective, phrasing, or structure.\" Alternatively, it might involve specific transformations like replacing certain phrases, changing sentence types, or using different tenses.\n\nWait, but the first input is a statement, and the output is also a statement. The second input is a question, output is a question. So maybe the instruction isn't about changing question to statement or vice versa. Instead, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, regardless of the original type. For example, turning direct statements into more indirect expressions, questions into more polite forms, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal or indirect version by using certain linguistic structures. For instance:\n\n- Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" (as in the first example).\n- Use \"Would you be able to\" instead of \"Can you\" (second example).\n- Replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival\" (third example).\n- Passive voice for the fourth example.\n- Expand \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase (fifth example).\n\nIf we look for a common thread, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version by using certain constructions. For example, using \"it is my opinion\" for statements expressing personal views, using \"would be able to\" for requests, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, using passive voice for certain verbs, and expanding gratitude into more elaborate expressions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more indirect or polite form by adjusting the subject, verb, or object. For example:\n\n- Change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" (passive voice, indirect perspective).\n- Change \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (more polite, using \"able\" instead of \"can\").\n- Change \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival\" (formal phrasing).\n- Change \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice, more objective).\n- Change \"Thanks\" to \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (more elaborate expression of gratitude).\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction involved converting the input into a more formal register, possibly by using more elevated vocabulary or sentence structures. For example, replacing contractions, using more formal pronouns, adjusting verb tenses, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more indirect or reported speech style. For instance, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" (similar to reporting someone else's view), changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" (a more indirect question), etc.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they seem to follow certain patterns:\n\n1. First person to third person (I → It is my opinion).\n2. Questions using \"can\" to \"would be able to\".\n3. Informal expressions replaced with formal ones (once you get there → upon your arrival).\n4. Active voice to passive voice (considered → were considered).\n5. Gratitude transformed into more elaborate expressions.\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, indirect, or polite version by applying these transformations. However, the exact instruction could vary. For example, it could be to replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", change \"can\" to \"be able to\", replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival\", use passive voice for \"considered\", and expand \"thanks\" into a longer phrase.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more general, like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or indirect version by adjusting the perspective, phrasing, or structure.\" But since the user provided specific examples, the instruction likely had specific elements.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, they often start with \"It is my opinion\" for the first input, which is a common way to express someone else's view rather than the speaker's own.<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the patterns between each input and output. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nComparing these, the output seems to use more formal or standard phrasing. \"Made up\" is colloquial, while \"fabricated\" is more formal. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using more formal language, replacing informal terms with their more standard equivalents.\n\nSecond example:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nHere, the structure changes. The original is a question starting with \"Can you...\", which is a yes/no question. The output is a more polite form, using \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more indirect request. So perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into more polite requests, possibly changing the structure and phrasing.\n\nThird input-output pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nThis transformation changes the perspective. The original uses \"I think\", which is a personal opinion, but the output shifts to a more formal \"It is my opinion\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase statements into a more formal tone, perhaps by removing first-person pronouns or expressing opinions as such.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nAgain, the output is more formal. \"Can't tell the difference\" is informal, whereas \"find it hard to distinguish\" is more formal. Also, the structure changes slightly. The original uses \"can't\" followed by the verb, while the output uses \"find it hard to\" plus the gerund. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more formal alternatives, adjusting the sentence structure accordingly.\n\nFifth example:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\"\nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nThis is a completely different structure. The input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction was to transform greetings into more formal or professional responses, expressing the same sentiment in a more polite way.\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, there's a common thread here. Each output seems to be a more formal or polite version of the input. Let's check if that holds for all cases.\n\nFirst input: \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (formal)\nSecond: question → polite request (more formal)\nThird: \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\" (formal)\nFourth: informal expression → formal alternative (like \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard\")\nFifth: casual greeting → formal anticipation (\"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting\")\n\nSo the pattern seems to be converting informal or less formal language into more formal or polite phrasing. But wait, the second example is a question turned into a request, which is also more formal. The third example shifts from first-person to a more formal statement. The fourth example replaces an informal expression with a more formal one. The fifth example changes the greeting into a more formal expression.\n\nBut let's see if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. However, the second example is a question converted into a request, which is a different type of transformation. So perhaps the instruction was broader than just making it formal; maybe it's about rephrasing in a more polite or formal manner, which could include changing question structures into requests, adjusting pronouns, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version, but some examples involve changing the sentence structure. For instance, the second example changes \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\", which is a different structure. Similarly, the third example changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\".\n\nWait, but the third example's output doesn't just change the subject; it also changes the perspective from first-person to a more objective statement. That might suggest that the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or objective tone, possibly by removing first-person references or expressing opinions as such.\n\nLooking at the fifth example, \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction was to turn casual greetings into more formal or professional responses, expressing the same intent but in a more polite way.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples? Let's see:\n\n1. Formalizing vocabulary (made up → fabricated)\n2. Changing question to request (Can you... → Would you be able to...)\n3. Shifting perspective from first-person to objective (I think → It is my opinion)\n4. Formalizing an expression (can't tell → find it hard to distinguish)\n5. Greeting → formal anticipation\n\nHmm. So the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly involving multiple transformations like changing sentence structure, replacing informal terms, adjusting perspective, etc.\n\nBut let's check if there's a unifying instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to \"rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version,\" which encompasses all the transformations observed. However, the second example specifically changes the question into a request, which is a structural change beyond just formality. Similarly, the third example changes the perspective from first-person to a more formal statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more formal version, adjusting sentence structure and phrasing as needed.\" This would cover all the examples. For instance:\n\n- \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\" (formal term)\n- \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" (polite request)\n- \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\" (more formal)\n- \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\" (formal phrasing)\n- \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal anticipation)\n\nSo the instruction likely involved transforming each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly requiring adjustments in sentence structure, vocabulary, and perspective.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with a more formal phrase like \"It is my opinion\" or \"I look forward to,\" which suggests that the instruction might have been to start sentences with such formal phrases when appropriate. However, not all outputs start with such phrases. For example, the second output starts with \"Would you be able to,\" which is a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could involve various transformations depending on the context. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, changing modal verbs, adjusting sentence structure, etc.\n\nLet me consider possible instructions that could lead to these outputs. For instance:\n\n1. \"Convert each input into a more formal version, replacing informal terms with their standard equivalents.\"\n   - This explains the first example (made up → fabricated).\n   - The second example's structure change might not fit here unless the instruction was broader.\n\n2. \"Rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version, adjusting sentence structure as necessary.\"\n   - This would cover the second example (question to request), third (perspective shift), fourth (vocabulary), fifth (greeting to anticipation).\n\n3. \"Express each input in a more formal tone, using appropriate business or academic language.\"\n   - This could explain the third example's shift from \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is more formal.\n\nBut the second example's transformation is a structural change rather than just a tone change. So maybe the instruction was more specific than just \"make it formal\"; it might have required converting questions into requests, adjusting pronouns, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to \"rephrase each input into a more formal version, adjusting sentence structure and phrasing as needed to achieve a more polite or professional tone.\"\n\nGiven that all the outputs seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs, with varying degrees of transformation, the most comprehensive instruction would be something along those lines. However, the second example's transformation from a question to a request is a significant structural change, which might indicate that the instruction was more about rephrasing into a more formal or polite form, which could include changing question types.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to \"convert each input into a more formal version, replacing contractions, changing modal verbs, and adjusting sentence structure to make the language more formal and polite.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n1. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" (contraction removed, more formal term)\n2. \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" (question to request, contraction removed, more formal verb)\n3. \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" (first-person removed, perspective shifted to more formal)\n4. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" (contraction removed, more formal phrasing)\n5. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input has been transformed into an output, so I need to find a common pattern or rule that applies to all of them.\n\nFirst, looking at the first pair: \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" The verb here changed from \"looks\" to \"resembles.\" Both are about similarity, but maybe \"resembles\" is more formal or specific? Or perhaps it's a synonym substitution. Let me check the others.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the entire phrase is rephrased. Instead of thanking directly, it's thanking by praising the help. So maybe the instruction is to convert expressions of gratitude into more formal or indirect phrasing?\n\nThird input: \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The preposition \"once\" is replaced with \"upon,\" and the structure changes slightly. Maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with more formal alternatives?\n\nFourth input: \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The verb \"stand\" is replaced with \"tolerate,\" which is a synonym. Again, similar to the first example, replacing a verb with a synonym.\n\nFifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" The question is rephrased from a direct request (\"want me to\") to a more formal or traditional phrasing using \"shall\" and \"accompany.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"Looks like\" → \"resembles\" (more formal). Second: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (more formal and indirect). Third: \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\" (using \"upon\" which is more formal). Fourth: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym replacement, more formal). Fifth: \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\" (formal phrasing).\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite tone.\" Alternatively, maybe \"Convert informal expressions into more formal equivalents.\"\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible angle. For example, some of the outputs use different structures. Like the third input uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"when you arrive.\" But \"upon\" is more formal. Similarly, \"accompany\" vs. \"go with,\" which is a bit different but still formal.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms or more formal counterparts. For instance, \"stand\" → \"tolerate,\" \"want\" → \"wish\" or \"desire,\" \"go with\" → \"accompany.\" But in the fifth example, \"do you want me to go with you\" becomes \"shall I accompany you.\" So \"go with\" is replaced with \"accompany,\" which is a synonym but more formal. Similarly, \"want me to\" becomes \"shall I,\" which is a more formal way of asking permission.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into statements or vice versa, but in the fifth example, it's a question becoming a statement-like question. Wait, no, the fifth input is a question, and the output is also a question but phrased differently. So that's not it.\n\nLooking back, the key seems to be formalizing the language. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Formal synonym.\n2. \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" More formal and indirect.\n3. \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Uses \"upon\" for formality.\n4. \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Synonym replacement for \"stand.\"\n5. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Formal phrasing with \"shall\" and replacing \"go with\" with \"accompany.\"\n\nAll fit the formalization idea. So the instruction likely was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Therefore, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal tone,\" or \"Convert informal expressions into their more formal equivalents.\"\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe it's about changing tenses or subject-verb agreement, but none of the examples show that. The first example is present tense, second is past tense (\"helped\" isn't shown), third is future (\"get there\"), fourth is present continuous (\"can't stand\"), fifth is present tense. So tenses don't seem to change.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction is to replace contractions with full forms. For example, \"I can't\" → \"I cannot,\" but in the fourth example, the output is \"I cannot tolerate...\" which does have the contraction replaced. However, the first example doesn't have a contraction. The second example is \"Thanks for your help\" which doesn't have a contraction. The third example is \"Please call once...\" no contraction. The fifth example is a question, no contraction. So maybe that's not the main focus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more polite. For example, \"Can I come?\" → \"May I come?\" But the fifth example uses \"Shall I...\" which is more formal than \"May I.\" So perhaps the instruction is to make the language more polite and formal.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the instruction was probably to rephrase each input into a more polite and formal version. That would explain all the transformations. Each input is made more formal, either through synonym substitution, structural changes (like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"when you arrive\"), or using more formal phrasing like \"accompany\" instead of \"go with.\"\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more polite and formal tone.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more polite and formal tone**. This involved several strategies:\n1. **Synonym Replacement**: Substituting informal verbs (e.g., \"stand\" → \"tolerate\", \"looks\" → \"resembles\").\n2. **Formal Phrasing**: Using more formal alternatives (e.g., \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\").\n3. **Polite Redirection**: Restructuring requests into more formal queries (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\" from \"Do you want me to go with you?\").\n\nThis transformation aligns with all input-output pairs, ensuring each response is both polite and linguistically elevated.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n4. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n5. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\nLooking at these, I need to find a common transformation rule that applies to all of them. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a negative statement (\"don't think it's a good idea\"), and the output is a more formal suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using formal language.\n\nSecond input: \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". These are synonyms but phrased differently. So perhaps replacing informal expressions with more formal or equivalent terms.\n\nThird input: \"is fire\" is slang for \"is great\". The output uses \"incredibly good\", which is a more descriptive and formal way. So maybe converting slang or informal expressions into more standard or elevated language.\n\nFourth input: \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\". This changes the subject from \"I\" to \"it\" and adds a more formal structure. So perhaps restructuring sentences to use more formal or objective language.\n\nFifth input: \"Thanks for your help\" is a common expression of gratitude. The output uses \"Your assistance is much appreciated\", which is a more formal and slightly more emphatic way of expressing thanks. So maybe converting casual expressions of gratitude into more formal or polite alternatives.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. All the outputs seem to be more formal, polite, or elevated versions of the inputs. Let's check each transformation:\n\n1. Negative to positive suggestion: The input is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output is a formal suggestion to not take action. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations using formal language.\n\n2. Informal to formal: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\". Both mean the same but in different registers. So perhaps replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents.\n\n3. Slang to standard: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". Converting slang into more descriptive and standard adjectives.\n\n4. First-person to third-person + opinion: Changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\". This might be part of making the statement more objective or formal.\n\n5. Gratitude expression: \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\". Converting casual thanks into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely involved transforming the input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original statement. Each input was rephrased using more formal language structures, replacing informal expressions, converting slang, adjusting sentence structure (like changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\"), and rephrasing gratitude in a more formal way.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible angle. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more assertive or confident tone. But in the first example, the output is a suggestion rather than a command. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or constructive message. But the first example is already a negative statement turned into a suggestion not to act. The third example is slang to positive. The fourth is changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\", which could be seen as making it more objective. The fifth is a more formal way of thanking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, using more precise vocabulary and sentence structures. That seems plausible. Let's see:\n\n- The first input becomes a formal suggestion.\n- The second uses \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand\".\n- Third converts slang to a more descriptive phrase.\n- Fourth changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\".\n- Fifth turns \"Thanks\" into a more formal expression.\n\nAll these transformations align with making the language more formal, precise, or polite. So the instruction was probably something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original statement, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more positive statement. However, the first input is a negative statement turned into a suggestion not to act, which is still somewhat negative. The third input is converted into a positive statement. The fourth input is changed from first-person to third-person opinion, which doesn't necessarily make it more positive. The fifth input is a positive thank you. So maybe not just positivity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more assertive or confident tone. But the first example's output is a suggestion, which is less assertive than a command. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with \"It is suggested...\", \"I cannot tolerate...\", \"This song is incredibly good...\", \"It is my opinion...\", \"Your assistance is much appreciated...\". These all follow a certain structure. For example, starting with \"It is suggested...\" or \"It is my opinion...\" might indicate that the instruction was to frame the input as a recommendation or opinion. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: Original is a statement of not thinking it's a good idea. The output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal recommendation or suggestion.\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate\". So replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" is a synonym but in a more formal register.\n\nThird input: \"is fire\" → \"incredibly good\". Converting slang to a more descriptive adjective.\n\nFourth input: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\". Changing the subject from first person to third person and adding \"my opinion\".\n\nFifth input: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\". Converting casual thanks into a more formal expression.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely required the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version. The key elements would be:\n\n- Using more formal or precise language (e.g., replacing contractions with full forms, using more elevated adjectives).\n- Restructuring sentences to be more objective or indirect (e.g., changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\").\n- Converting slang or informal expressions into more standard or descriptive terms.\n- Polishing the language to be more assertive or positive when appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original statement, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version** of the original statement. This involved several key transformations:\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. **Converting slang or colloquialisms** (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n3. **Structural adjustments** (e.g., \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\").\n4. **Polishing gratitude** (e.g., \"Thanks\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n5. **Formalizing suggestions** (e.g., rephrasing negative statements into polite recommendations).\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, polite, or elevated version of the original statement, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the initial instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations.\n\n1. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n2. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n5. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nLet me analyze each pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input uses \"can't tell the difference\" and the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\". Both are about not being able to differentiate. The structure changed from \"I can't [verb] the difference\" to \"I find it hard to [gerund] between them\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using a more formal or slightly different phrasing, replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\".\n\nSecond pair: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". Here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object \"what you said\" is omitted. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using a more direct verb like \"understand\" instead of \"get\".\n\nThird input: The original has \"I met yesterday\" without a relative pronoun, but the output adds \"whom\". So changing \"I met yesterday\" to \"whom I met yesterday\". That suggests adding a relative pronoun when referring to the subject of the clause. Maybe the instruction was to insert \"whom\" when the subject is the person who was met.\n\nFourth input: A question \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" The structure changes from \"Do you want me to [verb]?\" to \"Shall I [base verb]?\" So replacing \"do you want me to\" with \"shall I\" and changing the verb form. Perhaps the instruction was to convert questions starting with \"Do you want me to...\" into \"Shall I...\" followed by the base verb.\n\nFifth input: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting\". The output starts with \"It is my opinion that...\", which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using \"it is my opinion that\" instead of \"I think that\".\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, there might be multiple rules involved. Let's see if they can be categorized.\n\n1. Formalizing language (e.g., replacing contractions, using more formal verbs).\n2. Changing question structures (from \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\").\n3. Adding relative pronouns (\"whom\") in certain clauses.\n4. Replacing \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\".\n5. Changing \"got what you said\" to \"understood you\".\n\nWait, but the first example's transformation seems to involve both changing the verb phrase (\"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\") and adjusting the sentence structure. The second example is just changing the verb and omitting part of the sentence. The third adds a relative pronoun. The fourth changes the question structure. The fifth replaces \"I think that\" with a more formal phrasing.\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. But let's check if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish\"—both are formal, but the original is already somewhat formal. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to make the sentences more polite or less direct. For example, changing \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you\" could be seen as more polite. Similarly, \"Do you want me to...\" to \"Shall I...\" is a more polite way to ask for permission. The third example adds \"whom\" which might be considered more formal. The fifth example replaces \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", which is a more formal way of expressing agreement.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version. However, the first example doesn't seem to fit that pattern as much. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example: the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the addition of \"whom\" is to make the sentence more formal. In informal speech, people often drop the relative pronoun after the subject, but in formal writing, it's included. So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" when the subject of the relative clause is the person referred to earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth example replaces \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\", which is a more formal way of stating an opinion. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence using more formal language elements.\n\nBut then why does the first example change \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\"? That's also a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the overall instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using more formal verbs, replacing contractions, adding relative pronouns where appropriate, and converting questions into more polite forms.\n\nLooking at the fourth example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a common way to rephrase such questions into a more formal or polite request. So that's another possible transformation.\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction might have been something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using more formal verbs, replacing contractions, adding relative pronouns where appropriate, and converting questions into more polite forms.\"\n\nBut let's check if that works for all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"I can't tell the difference\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish\". Both are formal, but the original is already somewhat formal. However, \"find it hard to distinguish\" is more formal than \"can't tell the difference\". So that fits.\n\nSecond example: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\". \"Got\" is informal; \"understood\" is more formal. Also, the original had \"what you said\", which is a bit redundant; the output omits it, making it more concise and formal.\n\nThird example: Adds \"whom\" to make it more formal.\n\nFourth example: Converts the question into \"Shall I...\" which is more polite.\n\nFifth example: Replaces \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\", which is more formal.\n\nSo yes, this seems to fit all examples. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly including specific transformations like adding \"whom\" in certain clauses, replacing contractions, and converting questions into more polite forms.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, sometimes the instruction might have been to use a synonym or rephrase in a certain way. For example, \"can't tell\" vs. \"find it hard to distinguish\". But the key is that the instruction would guide the friend to apply these transformations systematically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, which encompasses all the observed changes. So the answer would be that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using specific transformations like adding \"whom\", replacing contractions, and converting questions into more polite forms.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, incorporating specific transformations such as:\n- Using more formal verbs (e.g., \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\").\n- Omitting redundancies (e.g., removing \"what you said\" in \"I understood you\").\n- Adding relative pronouns like \"whom\" for clarity (e.g., \"whom I met yesterday\").\n- Converting questions like \"Do you want me to...\" into polite requests (\"Shall I...\").\n- Replacing \"I think that\" with \"It is my opinion that\" for formality.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures each output aligns with a more formal or polite register while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate all these outputs from the given inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the patterns between each input and output. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nWait, here the output adds \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". So the original sentence didn't have any relative pronoun, but the output added \"whom\". That suggests maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause or a relative pronoun. But why \"whom\"? Maybe the instruction was about converting a noun phrase into a relative clause using \"whom\" as the relative pronoun. But in the original input, \"I met yesterday\" is a participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\", not a relative clause. So adding \"whom\" might be part of making it a relative clause. For example, changing \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" to \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction could be to convert the participle phrase into a relative clause with \"whom\".\n\nBut wait, the second input-output pair might give more clues. Let's check that.\n\nSecond input: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nHmm, here the output replaces \"fire\" with \"incredibly good\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain adjectives with more descriptive phrases. But \"fire\" is slang for something cool or awesome. The output uses \"incredibly good\", which is a more formal way. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase common slang terms into more standard phrasing. But \"fire\" isn't exactly slang; maybe it's a colloquial term. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to expand the adjective with a more elaborate description. But this seems context-dependent. However, looking at other outputs might help.\n\nThird input: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nHere, the output changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". So \"once\" is replaced with \"upon\", and \"you get there\" becomes \"your arrival\". So maybe the instruction was to replace certain conjunctions or phrases with more formal alternatives. \"Once\" can mean \"when\" or \"after\", but in this context, it's used as \"after you arrive\". The output uses \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal way of saying \"when you arrive\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"once\" with \"upon\" followed by the noun phrase. But in the input, \"once you get there\" is a clause, so replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and then the rest. But the output is \"upon your arrival\", which is a noun phrase. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"once you [verb] there\" into \"upon your [noun]\". But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\"\nOutput: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nOriginal is a casual greeting, output is a more formal expression. So \"see you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you\". So the instruction might be to turn casual expressions into more formal ones. But how does that apply to all cases? Let's see the fifth input.\n\nFifth input: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nHere, \"looks like\" is changed to \"resembles\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" when referring to physical appearance. But why only in this case? Wait, the first output added \"whom\", the second expanded \"fire\", third turned \"once you get there\" into \"upon your arrival\", fourth turned \"see you\" into \"look forward to meeting you\", fifth changed \"looks like\" to \"resembles\". These seem like different transformations. So perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple types of replacements depending on the context. But that complicates things. How can a single instruction cover all these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version. For example, replacing contractions, informal phrases, colloquialisms, etc., with their more formal equivalents. Let's check:\n\n- \"I met\" (no change)\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"\n- \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\"\n- \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nSo some of these are replacing specific phrases, others are changing parts of speech. For instance, \"fire\" is replaced with an adjective phrase, \"once you get there\" becomes a noun phrase, \"see you\" becomes a verb phrase, and \"looks like\" becomes a verb. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly expanding certain phrases, replacing informal terms, etc. But how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nLooking back at the first output: adding \"whom\" to the noun phrase. That's a different transformation. So perhaps the instruction was to add a relative clause to each noun phrase that doesn't already have one. But in the first input, the noun phrase is \"the lawyer\", and the output adds \"whom I met yesterday\". So the instruction could be to convert the participle phrase into a relative clause with \"whom\". But why \"whom\" specifically? Because the subject of the participle is \"I\", so the relative pronoun should be \"who\" if the lawyer is the subject. Wait, in the original input, \"I met yesterday\" is a participle phrase modifying \"lawyer\". So the lawyer is the one who was met yesterday. So the relative clause should use \"who\" as the subject. But the output uses \"whom\". That's confusing. Unless the instruction was to use \"whom\" regardless of the subject. But that's grammatically incorrect. So maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause with \"whom\" even though it's not the correct relative pronoun. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\". So the relative pronoun is \"whom\", which is the object form. But in the original sentence, the participle phrase \"I met yesterday\" is acting as an adjective modifying \"lawyer\". So the relative clause would typically use \"who\" if the lawyer is the subject. But here, the output uses \"whom\". That's odd. Unless the instruction was to add \"whom\" regardless of grammar. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun? Like \"whose\", but the output uses \"whom\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause with \"whom\" to each noun phrase that doesn't have one. But why in the first case, the noun phrase \"lawyer\" didn't have a relative clause before, and the output adds \"whom I met yesterday\". So the instruction could be to add a relative clause with \"whom\" to each noun phrase. But why \"whom\" instead of \"who\"? Unless the instruction was to use \"whom\" in all cases, even when it's grammatically incorrect. But that seems like a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a possessive pronoun, but the output uses \"whom\". This is confusing.\n\nLet's move to the second output: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, the instruction might be to replace \"fire\" with a more descriptive phrase. But \"fire\" is slang for something awesome. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal adjectives with more formal ones. But why only in this case? The third input's output is a different transformation. So perhaps the instruction was to perform multiple types of transformations based on the input. But that's hard to generalize into a single instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal counterparts. For example:\n\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"\n- \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\"\n- \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nBut how to connect these? Maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents. But \"fire\" is not an informal expression; it's a term used in slang contexts. Similarly, \"see you\" is a casual greeting, but \"look forward to meeting you\" is a more formal alternative. \"Looks like\" is a common phrase, and \"resembles\" is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction was to replace certain common phrases with their more formal versions. But how to determine which phrases to replace?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to add a relative clause to each noun phrase that doesn't already have one. For example, the first input's noun phrase \"lawyer\" didn't have a relative clause, so adding \"whom I met yesterday\". The second input's noun phrase \"song\" also didn't have a relative<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to analyze each pair to see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nSo here, the output seems to be a more formal or polite rephrasing. Maybe replacing \"thanks\" with \"assistance is appreciated\" in a different structure. Let's check the second pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nWait, that's interesting. The output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses? But wait, the first input didn't have a possessive, but the second input had \"my\" (implied) which became \"whom I met\". Let me check the third input:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the subject changed from \"I\" to \"Various\", and the verb tense from past to passive. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more general or passive voice version?\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nThis is a completely different structure. The output is a future-oriented statement expressing anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to turn casual greetings into more formal or anticipatory statements?\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, the output is a more descriptive and positive rephrasing. So maybe the instruction is to translate informal slang into more standard or positive phrasing.\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, they seem to involve different types of rephrasing. Let's categorize them:\n\n1. Formalizing gratitude (\"Thanks\" to \"Your assistance...\").\n2. Changing possessive to relative clause (\"I met\" to \"whom I met\").\n3. Passive voice conversion (\"considered\" to \"were considered\").\n4. Anticipatory greeting (\"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting\").\n5. Slang to standard (\"fire\" to \"incredibly good\").\n\nHmm, this is a mix of different transformations. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version. But how do these all fit under one instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to perform multiple transformations depending on the context. For example, if the input is a casual expression of thanks, rephrase it formally. If it's a possessive clause, change it to a relative clause. If it's a greeting, turn it into an anticipation. If it's slang, replace it with a more standard phrase. And if it's a past tense active sentence, make it passive.\n\nBut that seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the examples show different types of transformations. Wait, but maybe there's a common thread. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1. Formalized gratitude.\n2. Changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" – perhaps changing the pronoun to a relative clause.\n3. Passive voice.\n4. Anticipatory greeting.\n5. Slang to standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the examples show different types of transformations. However, the fifth example is slang to standard, which might not fit the others. Maybe the instruction is to translate informal expressions into more formal ones, but the fifth example is a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more positive or appreciative tone, but the second example doesn't seem positive. Wait, the second output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" which is neutral. The fourth output is positive. The fifth is positive. The first is positive. The third is neutral. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone. Let's see:\n\nFirst input becomes formal. Second input changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" – maybe making it more formal by using \"whom\" instead of \"I met\". Third input becomes passive. Fourth input becomes anticipatory. Fifth input becomes positive. So that's a mix. Maybe the instruction is to apply multiple transformations depending on the input type. For example:\n\n- If the input is a casual expression of thanks, rephrase it formally.\n- If the input is a possessive clause, convert it to a relative clause.\n- If it's a greeting, turn it into an anticipation.\n- If it's slang, replace it with a more standard phrase.\n- If it's a past active sentence, make it passive.\n\nBut that's a lot of conditions. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the examples show different transformations. Wait, maybe the key is that all outputs are more formal or polite than the inputs. Let's check:\n\n1. Input is casual thanks; output is formal.\n2. Input is \"I met\" (neutral); output uses \"whom\" (more formal).\n3. Input is active past; output is passive.\n4. Input is casual greeting; output is formal anticipation.\n5. Input is slang; output is more standard and positive.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version. But how does that fit all examples? Let's see:\n\nFor the second input, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" makes it more formal. The third input becomes passive, which is sometimes seen as more formal. The fourth input's output is more formal and anticipatory. The fifth input's output is more positive and standard. The first input is already formal but rephrased. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the exact method varies per input. However, the problem is that the instruction should be a single rule or set of rules that applies to all inputs. But given the examples, it's challenging to find a single instruction that covers all these transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the exact transformation depends on the input's structure. For example:\n\n- If the input is a direct statement of thanks, rephrase it formally.\n- If the input is a possessive clause, convert it to a relative clause.\n- If it's a greeting, turn it into an anticipation.\n- If it's slang, replace it with a more standard phrase.\n- If it's a past active sentence, make it passive.\n\nBut this requires multiple steps, which might not be captured in a single instruction. However, the problem states that the friend followed the instruction and provided outputs for each input. So the instruction must be a set of rules or a process that can be applied uniformly to all inputs to generate the outputs.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the exact method varies. For example:\n\n- \"Thanks for your help.\" → Formal gratitude.\n- \"I met\" → Use \"whom\" for formality.\n- \"considered\" → Passive voice.\n- \"See you\" → Anticipation.\n- \"fire\" → Positive adjective.\n\nBut how to unify these? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version, but the exact transformation depends on the part of speech or structure. For instance:\n\n- Replace \"thanks\" with \"your assistance is much appreciated\".\n- Convert possessive to relative clause.\n- Passive voice conversion.\n- Greeting to anticipation.\n- Slang to standard positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version using specific transformations. For example:\n\n- For expressions of thanks, rephrase as formal gratitude.\n- For possessive clauses, convert to relative clauses.\n- For greetings, turn into anticipation.\n- For slang, replace with standard positive terms.\n- For past active sentences, use passive voice.\n\nBut this still feels like multiple rules. However, the problem might require a single instruction that encompasses all these transformations. Let's think about possible instructions:\n\n1. **Formalize the input**: Make the output more formal, polite, or positive. The exact method depends on the input's structure.\n   - For \"Thanks for your help.\", formalize the gratitude.\n   - For \"I met\", use \"whom\" for formality.\n   - For \"considered\", use passive voice.\n   - For \"See you\", express anticipation.\n   - For \"fire\", replace with \"incredibly good\".\n\nBut this is still vague. Another approach: look for a common element in all outputs. For example, the outputs are all more formal or polite. The first output is formal. The second uses \"whom\" (formal). The third is passive (sometimes seen as formal). The fourth is anticipatory (polite). The fifth is positive (polite). So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version. But how to define that as a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or positive version by applying specific transformations. For example:\n\n- Replace \"thanks\" with \"your assistance is much appreciated\".\n-<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at the examples, each input seems to have been transformed into a more formal or polite version of the statement. Let me break down each pair to see the pattern.\n\nFirst example: Input \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" So here, the friend replaced \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". That's a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, the second input \"This song is fire.\" Output becomes \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is a slang term meaning something is great, and the output uses \"incredibly good\" as a more standard expression. \n\nThird input: \"Thanks for your help.\" Output \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So instead of a casual \"thanks\", it's converted into a more formal \"assistance is much appreciated\". Fourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output \"I understood you.\" Again, replacing informal phrasing with a more direct statement. Fifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"made up\" is rephrased as \"fabricated\", which is a more precise term.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely asks the friend to convert informal or colloquial expressions into more formal, polite, or standard English. Each input is a common phrase or expression that's considered informal, and the output is a more elevated version. Let me check if there's a common thread here. All the outputs seem to be more formal, perhaps in a professional or academic context. For example, replacing contractions (\"can't\" -> \"find it hard to\"), slang (\"fire\" -> \"incredibly good\"), casual gratitude (\"thanks\" -> \"assistance is much appreciated\"), understatement (\"got what you said\" -> \"understood you\"), and idiomatic expressions (\"made up\" -> \"fabricated\").\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, suitable for certain contexts like business emails, academic writing, or formal correspondence. Alternatively, it could be about converting conversational language into a more polite form, especially in customer service or professional settings where such phrasing is expected.\n\nWait, but looking at the fifth example, \"made up\" vs \"fabricated\". \"Fabricated\" is a stronger term, implying intentional creation of false information, whereas \"made up\" can sometimes just mean composed or created, but in the context of a story, it might mean the same. However, the output uses \"entirely\" which adds emphasis. So maybe the instruction was to make the statement more precise or emphatic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal equivalent, using more precise vocabulary and avoiding contractions, slang, or informal expressions. The key is that each output is a more formal version of the input, often replacing colloquialisms with more standard phrasing.\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal, polite, or precise version of the statement.\" Or maybe \"Rephrase each input into a more standard English sentence, avoiding contractions and slang.\"\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples. First input: \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\"—formal. Second: \"fire\" (slang) becomes \"incredibly good\"—more descriptive. Third: \"thanks\" becomes \"assistance is much appreciated\"—polite. Fourth: \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you\"—direct. Fifth: \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\"—more precise. Yes, this fits.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or standard English version, replacing informal expressions with their more appropriate equivalents.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or standard English version**, replacing informal expressions with their more appropriate equivalents. Specifically, the task involved converting colloquialisms, slang, contractions, and casual phrasing into more precise, elevated language suitable for formal contexts. \n\n**Key transformations observed:**\n1. **Colloquialisms → Formal Terms**:  \n   - \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\"  \n   - \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"  \n   - \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"  \n\n2. **Contractions → Standard Phrasing**:  \n   - \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\"  \n\n3. **Slang/Idioms → Precise Descriptions**:  \n   - \"This song is fire\" → \"This song is incredibly good\"  \n\n4. **Casual Gratitude → Polite Acknowledgment**:  \n   - \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"  \n\nThe goal was to ensure clarity, precision, and formality in communication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the rule or transformation applied by the friend. Let me go through each pair step by step.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHmm, comparing these two. The original uses \"whole\" which becomes \"entire\" in the output. Also, \"made up\" is changed to \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonyms or more formal equivalents. But let's check other pairs to see if this holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" which is another synonym. The structure remains similar. So perhaps the instruction is to replace adjectives or adverbs with their more formal or specific counterparts.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"Thanks for your help.\"\nOutput: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nThis seems like a rephrasing rather than a direct synonym replacement. The original is a simple expression of gratitude, and the output is a more formal way of saying the same thing. So maybe the instruction is to convert casual expressions into more formal or polite phrasing.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the pronoun \"I\" is replaced with \"whom,\" changing the relative clause from \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" This suggests that the instruction involves replacing first-person pronouns with their object forms (whom) when they are used as objects in a sentence. Wait, but in the original input, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause. The output changes \"I\" to \"whom,\" which would make the relative clause \"whom I met.\" That's correct because \"whom\" is the objective case here. So this might be part of the instruction: replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in such contexts.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis is a significant change. The original is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a positive suggestion to take no action. The structure is completely different. The original is a first-person perspective, while the output is a third-person passive voice construction. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using formal language, possibly converting first-person to third-person and restructuring the sentence.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations. Let's see possible patterns:\n\n1. Synonym replacement: For example, \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"many\" → \"various.\"\n2. Formalizing expressions: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n3. Changing pronouns: \"I\" → \"whom\" in certain clauses.\n4. Restructuring sentences: From first-person negative to third-person positive suggestions.\n\nBut wait, the fifth input-output pair doesn't fit the first three patterns. Let's look again. The fifth input is a statement of opinion (\"We don't think...\"), and the output is a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase opinions into recommendations or suggestions, often using more formal language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some seem to be translations into more formal English, possibly avoiding contractions or informal expressions. For example, \"wasn't\" becomes \"is not,\" but none of the outputs show that. Alternatively, the outputs might be more academic or professional in tone.\n\nWait, the first four outputs are all more formal versions of the inputs. The fifth one is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion. So perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or academic style, possibly rephrasing certain structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to perform multiple transformations: replace certain words with synonyms, adjust pronoun usage, rephrase gratitude, and convert negative statements into positive suggestions.\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction? Let's think about possible instructions that could generate these outputs.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. \"Replace 'I' with 'whom' when it's the object of a verb in a relative clause.\"\n   - This explains the fourth pair.\n\n2. \"Convert casual expressions into more formal phrasing.\"\n   - This covers the second and third pairs.\n\n3. \"Replace 'whole' with 'entire,' 'many' with 'various,' and 'made up' with 'fabricated.'\"\n   - This addresses the first pair.\n\n4. \"Rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using formal language.\"\n   - This explains the fifth pair.\n\nBut the fifth pair is a bit tricky. The original is \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" and the output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" So the instruction might involve taking a statement of opinion and turning it into a recommendation, possibly using \"it is suggested that\" or similar constructions.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction could be something like:\n\n\"Your task is to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic style. Specifically, replace 'I' with 'whom' when it's the object of a verb in a relative clause; convert casual expressions like 'thanks' into more formal phrasing; replace words like 'whole' with 'entire,' 'many' with 'various,' and 'made up' with 'fabricated'; and rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using formal language structures.\"\n\nBut let's check if this instruction would produce the given outputs.\n\nFor the first input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Using the instruction, replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Output matches.\n\nSecond input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" (if the clause is \"whom I considered\"), but wait, the original is \"I considered many approaches.\" The relative clause would be \"the approaches I considered,\" so \"I\" is the subject. Wait, the instruction says to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object. In the original input, \"I considered many approaches\" is the main clause. There's no relative clause here. Hmm, maybe I misapplied that part.\n\nWait, the fourth input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is part of the relative clause modifying \"lawyer.\" So \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. The instruction says to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object. So in the fourth input, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"I\" isn't the object here. Therefore, the output changes \"I\" to \"whom\" only when it's the object. So in the fourth input, since \"I\" is the subject, it remains. Wait, but the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction must be to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object in the relative clause. So in the fourth input, the relative clause is \"whom I met,\" where \"I\" is the object. So the instruction would require replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" there. But in the original input, the relative clause is \"I met,\" so \"I\" is the subject. Therefore, according to the instruction, we shouldn't replace \"I\" there. But the output does replace \"I\" with \"whom.\" That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the instruction. If the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" whenever it's the object in a relative clause, then in the fourth input, the relative clause is \"I met,\" where \"I\" is the subject. So no replacement needed. But the output has \"whom I met.\" That suggests that the instruction might actually be to replace \"I\" with \"who\" or \"whom\" depending on the context. But in standard grammar, \"I\" is the subject, so it shouldn't be replaced. However, the output here replaces \"I\" with \"whom,\" which is incorrect unless the original \"I\" was the object. So perhaps the instruction is not accurate, or there's a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"who\" when it's the subject and \"whom\" when it's the object. But in the fourth input, \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, so it should remain. But the output changes it to \"whom,\" which is grammatically incorrect. This inconsistency suggests that either the instruction is different, or perhaps the fourth input-output pair is an exception.\n\nWait, but the fourth input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction here is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. But why? Because \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. Unless the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" regardless of its role, which would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"who\" when it's the subject and \"whom\" when it's the object. But in the fourth input, \"I\" is the subject, so it should stay. But the output changes it to \"whom,\" which is wrong. This suggests that either the instruction is incorrect<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate all these outputs from the given inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to look for patterns or common transformations between the inputs and outputs. Let me list them out again:\n\n1. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the input had \"I met\" without a relative pronoun, but the output added \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to add a relative pronoun like \"whom\" when referring to people in certain contexts?\n\n2. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - The verb changed from \"stand\" to \"tolerate\". So perhaps the instruction was to replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"?\n\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   - The input is a simple thank you, but the output is a more formal expression. Maybe the instruction was to convert gratitude into a more formal acknowledgment, possibly expanding it with \"assistance\" and adding \"much appreciated\"?\n\n4. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - The phrase \"once you get there\" became \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"once\" or \"when\" into more formal terms like \"upon\"?\n\n5. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - This seems like a complete restructuring of the sentence. The original is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a suggestion phrased as a conditional. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using \"it is suggested that...\" and changing the structure entirely?\n\nNow, looking for a common thread here. Each input-output pair shows a different transformation, but maybe the overall instruction was to convert informal expressions into more formal or standard English, possibly through specific vocabulary substitutions or sentence restructuring.\n\nLet me check each example again:\n\n1. The first input uses \"was helpful,\" and the output adds \"whom.\" Maybe the instruction was to add relative pronouns when referring to people? But why only in some cases? Or perhaps it's about making the sentence more formal by replacing \"was helpful\" with \"is helpful\" (but that doesn't fit). Wait, the original says \"was helpful,\" output is same except \"whom\" added. So maybe the instruction was to insert \"whom\" when the subject is a person in a relative clause? But the input didn't have a relative clause. Wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the addition of \"whom\" here might be part of making the sentence more formal. But why \"whom\"? Maybe the instruction was to use formal pronouns instead of contractions or informal ones. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"was\" with \"is\" and add \"whom\" in certain contexts. But that's speculative.\n\n2. The second example changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" So replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\" and changing the verb from \"stand\" to \"tolerate.\" That's a common formalization step. For example, \"can't stand\" is informal, so replacing it with \"cannot tolerate\" makes it more formal.\n\n3. The third example turns a simple \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase. So maybe the instruction was to expand expressions of gratitude into more formal or elaborate responses, like using \"assistance\" and \"much appreciated.\"\n\n4. The fourth example changes \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival.\" So replacing \"once\" with \"upon\" and adjusting the structure. This could be part of formalizing the language, using more formal prepositions or phrases.\n\n5. The fifth example completely rephrases the sentence into a suggestion using \"it is suggested that...\" and changing the structure from a negative statement to a conditional. So this seems like a major restructuring rather than a substitution. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions, using formal language structures.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert the given sentence into a more formal or standard English version by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting verb tenses, and restructuring sentences where necessary.\"\n\nBut let's check if that fits all examples:\n\n1. Adding \"whom\" could be part of formalizing the relative clause. But why only in this case? Maybe the instruction was to use formal pronouns and avoid contractions. However, the first input didn't have any contractions, so maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentence more formal by replacing certain words or phrases. For example, \"was helpful\" remains the same, but \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" to use a relative pronoun. But why \"whom\"? Maybe the instruction was to use formal pronouns in relative clauses. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the first output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the addition of \"whom\" here might be part of making the sentence more formal. Similarly, the second example replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal. Third example expands \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase. Fourth example uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" Fifth example restructures the entire sentence into a suggestion phrased formally.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version of the sentence, possibly through various transformations like replacing informal verbs, expanding gratitude expressions, restructuring clauses, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to follow certain patterns. For example, the first output uses \"whom,\" the second uses \"cannot,\" the third uses \"Your assistance,\" the fourth uses \"upon,\" and the fifth uses \"it is suggested that...\" So each output has a different formal element. Therefore, the instruction might be a general one like \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to apply specific transformations for each case. But since the user provided five different examples, the instruction likely covers multiple aspects. For instance, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" expanding \"Thanks\" into a longer phrase, using \"whom\" in relative clauses, restructuring \"call once you get there\" into \"call upon your arrival,\" and rephrasing the negative statement into a suggestion.\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? The key is that each output is a more formal version of the input. So the instruction could be: \"Rephrase the given sentence into a more formal or standard English version, ensuring clarity and correctness.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like \"Replace informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjust verb tenses, and use appropriate punctuation.\" But without seeing the exact instruction, we have to infer based on the outputs.\n\nAnother approach: look for common elements in the outputs. For example, the outputs often start with the subject (like \"Your assistance\" in the third example), use \"it is suggested that\" in the fifth, and \"please call upon\" in the fourth. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal request or suggestion, possibly using specific phrases like \"it is suggested that\" or \"please call upon.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the input into a more polite or formal tone, which would explain the changes in the third example (simple \"Thanks\" to \"Your assistance...\"), the fourth example (using \"upon\" instead of \"once\"), and the fifth example (rephrasing into a suggestion).\n\nPutting all this together, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal or polite manner, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the same meaning.\"\n\nBut let's verify if this instruction would produce the given outputs. For example:\n\n- First input: Formalizing \"was helpful\" by adding \"whom\" (maybe to make it a relative clause) but the output is the same except for \"whom.\" Hmm, maybe the instruction was to use formal pronouns in certain contexts. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"was helpful\" with \"is helpful\" (but the output is same). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to make the sentence more formal by replacing contractions (though the first input didn't have any), using more formal verbs (like \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\"), expanding gratitude, restructuring clauses, and rephrasing suggestions.\n\nGiven that the outputs vary widely, the instruction must cover multiple aspects. The most comprehensive instruction that fits all examples would be: \"Convert the given sentence into a more formal or standard English version by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting verb tenses, and restructuring sentences where necessary.\"\n\nThis instruction would account for all the transformations observed:\n\n1. Adding \"whom\" to formalize the relative clause.\n2. Replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" for formality.\n3. Expanding \"Thanks\" into a longer, more formal phrase.\n4. Restructuring \"call once you get there\" into \"call upon your arrival\" for formality.\n5. Rephrasing the negative statement into a suggestion using formal language<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let's start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nHmm, so \"looks like\" was replaced with \"resembles\". Both mean similar things, but maybe there's a nuance. \"Looks like\" can sometimes be more about appearance, while \"resembles\" might imply a closer comparison. But maybe it's just a synonym substitution.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, \"fire\" is slang meaning something is great or awesome. The output uses \"incredibly good\" as a more formal equivalent. So perhaps the instruction was to replace informal slang with more standard phrasing.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\"Whole\" vs. \"entire\"—both mean complete. But \"made up\" is a bit colloquial. The output uses \"fabricated,\" which is a more formal synonym. So again, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\nOriginal uses \"once you get there,\" which is a bit informal. The output rephrases it using \"upon your arrival,\" which sounds more formal or perhaps more elegant. So maybe the instruction was to make the language more polite or formal.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nOriginal is a question using \"do you want me...\" which is more casual. The output uses \"shall I accompany you,\" which is more formal and uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with.\" So this seems like converting a casual request into a more formal or traditional phrasing.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the common thread seems to be replacing informal or conversational language with more formal, polite, or traditional phrasing. Let's check each example again:\n\n1. \"Looks like\" → \"resembles\": Maybe not strictly formal, but both are synonyms. However, \"resembles\" is more formal than \"looks like.\"\n2. \"Fire\" → \"incredibly good\": Replacing slang with a more descriptive phrase.\n3. \"Whole\" vs. \"entire\": Both mean the same, but \"entire\" is more formal.\n4. \"Once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\": Formal rephrasing.\n5. \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I...\": Changing the structure from a casual offer to a more formal \"shall I\" and replacing \"go with\" with \"accompany.\"\n\nSo the instruction likely asks to convert the input sentences into more formal, polite, or traditional English, possibly avoiding contractions, slang, and informal expressions. Alternatively, it could be about rephrasing in a more elevated tone, using more precise vocabulary.\n\nWait, but let's think if there's another angle. For example, some outputs seem to use more specific words. Like \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up.\" \"Fabricated\" has a stronger connotation of being intentionally false, whereas \"made up\" can also mean created but maybe less strongly associated with lying. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their more precise synonyms, especially when the original is slightly informal.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction might involve changing the sentence structure. For example, the fourth input uses \"once you get there,\" which is a time clause, and the output uses \"upon your arrival,\" which is a prepositional phrase. So restructuring the sentence to use different conjunctions or phrases.\n\nLooking at the fifth input, changing \"do you want me...\" to \"shall I...\" is a shift in the interrogative form. \"Do you want...\" is more casual, while \"Shall I...\" is more formal and uses the subjunctive mood.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction probably requires converting the input sentences into more formal, polite, or traditional English by replacing informal expressions, slang, contractions, and adjusting sentence structures to be more elevated.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if all examples fit this pattern:\n\n1. \"Looks like\" → \"resembles\": More formal.\n2. \"Fire\" → \"incredibly good\": Formal replacement.\n3. \"Whole\" → \"entire\": Formal.\n4. \"Once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\": Formal rephrasing.\n5. \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\": Formal and polite.\n\nYes, all examples align with this pattern. Therefore, the instruction was likely to transform the input sentences into more formal, polite, or traditional English by replacing informal terms, slang, contractions, and adjusting sentence structures accordingly.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **convert the input sentences into more formal, polite, or traditional English** by replacing informal expressions, slang, contractions, and adjusting sentence structures to elevate the tone. Here’s how each input-output pair aligns with this rule:\n\n1. **\"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\"**  \n   *Formal synonym substitution* (replaces the colloquial \"looks like\" with the more precise \"resembles\").\n\n2. **\"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\"**  \n   *Replacing slang with formal phrasing* (translates the informal slang \"fire\" to the descriptive \"incredibly good\").\n\n3. **\"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"**  \n   *Using precise synonyms* (substitutes the informal \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" for stronger connotation).\n\n4. **\"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\"**  \n   *Structural rephrasing* (replaces the casual \"once you get there\" with the formal \"upon your arrival\").\n\n5. **\"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"**  \n   *Polite form conversion* (changes the informal \"do you want...\" to the formal \"shall I...\" and replaces \"go with\" with \"accompany\").  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction required transforming the inputs into more formal, polite, or traditional English by replacing informal terms, slang, contractions, and adjusting sentence structures.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule from the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nHmm. Let's look at each transformation step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair: The input uses \"considered many approaches,\" and the output changes it to \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject \"I\" is removed, and \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches.\" Also, the verb structure changes from past tense \"considered\" to passive voice \"were considered.\" Wait, but the original is active voice: \"I considered...\" becomes passive \"Various approaches were considered.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a passive voice construction where the subject is replaced with \"Various\" or similar?\n\nBut wait, the second input-output pair: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the entire clause starting with \"I think\" is being rephrased as \"It is my opinion...\" So perhaps whenever there's a statement starting with \"I think,\" it's being converted into a more formal or indirect expression. But why does the third input-output pair change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"? That seems like changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom,\" which might be part of a relative clause. Let me check that third example again: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" becomes \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. That's a case of converting a direct object pronoun to an objective case in a relative clause. But why only in that specific case?\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"look like\" is changed to \"resemble.\" That's a synonym substitution. Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate.\" So maybe the instruction involves replacing certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nWait, but looking at the first example, the structure changes from active to passive. Let's confirm that. Original: \"I considered many approaches.\" Passive would be \"Many approaches were considered by me.\" But the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So instead of \"by me,\" they just use \"various\" as the subject. So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a passive voice where the subject is replaced with a general term like \"various,\" \"several,\" etc., depending on the context. But how does that apply to other examples?\n\nSecond example: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, the entire clause is being rephrased. Maybe when the input starts with \"I think,\" the output is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. But why not other similar structures? For instance, if the input was \"I believe that...\", would the output be \"It is my belief that...\"? Or maybe only when \"I think\" is used.\n\nThird example: Changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" in the relative clause. So in the original, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output uses \"whom.\" That's because \"whom\" is the objective case, whereas \"I\" is the subject. So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where it's the object of the relative clause. But why only in that case? Let's see another example. If the input was \"He saw the man I met yesterday,\" would the output be \"He saw the man whom I met yesterday\"? That makes sense. So maybe the rule is to convert \"I\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the object of the relative clause.\n\nFourth example: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"look like\" is replaced with \"resemble.\" That's a synonym substitution. Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate.\" So maybe the instruction includes replacing certain verbs with their synonyms, especially when they are informal or colloquial expressions.\n\nFifth example: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\" Again, a synonym substitution, but perhaps more formal.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might involve multiple transformations:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice where possible, using general terms like \"various\" as the subject.\n2. Replace \"I think that...\" with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n3. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the object.\n4. Replace informal expressions (like \"look like\", \"can't stand\") with their more formal or synonym equivalents.\n\nBut wait, the first example doesn't fit the passive voice conversion. Let me check again. The first input is \"I considered many approaches.\" The output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject \"I\" is removed, and the verb is made passive. So the original active sentence becomes a passive sentence with \"various\" as the subject. So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a passive voice where the subject is replaced with a general noun phrase (like \"various,\" \"several,\" etc.), depending on the context.\n\nBut how does that apply to the other examples? Let's see:\n\nSecond example: \"I think that this is interesting\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This doesn't seem to fit the passive voice pattern. So maybe the instruction has multiple rules, not just one.\n\nThird example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. So that's a different rule.\n\nFourth example: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n\nFifth example: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is a combination of several transformations:\n\n1. Convert active voice to passive voice, replacing the subject with a general noun (like \"various,\" \"several,\" etc.) when possible.\n2. Replace \"I think that...\" with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n3. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the object.\n4. Replace informal expressions (like \"look like\", \"can't stand\") with their more formal or synonym equivalents.\n\nBut let's check if these rules apply consistently across all examples.\n\nFirst example: Active to passive. Yes, \"I considered\" becomes \"were considered\" with \"various\" as the subject.\n\nSecond example: \"I think\" becomes \"my opinion.\" So maybe whenever the input starts with \"I think,\" it's converted to \"It is my opinion...\" regardless of the rest of the sentence.\n\nThird example: Relative clause \"I met\" → \"whom I met.\" So replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in such cases.\n\nFourth example: \"looks like\" → \"resembles.\" So replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble.\"\n\nFifth example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Replacing the phrase with a synonym.\n\nNow, let's see if there are other possible rules. For example, the third example also changes \"was helpful\" to \"was helpful,\" so no change there. The fourth example changes \"her sister\" to \"her sister,\" so no change. The fifth example changes \"his temper\" to \"his temper,\" so no change. So the main changes are in the first four examples.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the first example, the output uses \"various\" instead of \"many.\" Why not \"many\"? Maybe \"various\" is used when the original adjective is \"many,\" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"various\" is a more formal alternative. But in the third example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\nSo putting all this together, the instruction likely involves several steps:\n\n1. Convert the sentence to passive voice where possible, using a general noun (like \"various\") as the subject.\n2. Replace \"I think that...\" with \"It is my opinion that...\"\n3. Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the object.\n4. Replace informal expressions (like \"look like\", \"can't stand\") with their more formal or synonym equivalents.\n\nBut wait, the first example doesn't have \"I think,\" so why is the second example covered by that rule? Because the second example's input is \"I think that...\" and the output is<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a slightly different structure or wording. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nFirst input: \"I considered many approaches.\" Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and the verb tense stayed the same. The main idea is about considering multiple methods. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal way?\n\nSecond input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Again, changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Both express disapproval of someone's temper. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with synonyms or more formal terms?\n\nThird input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the first person perspective (\"I think\") is converted into a third person (\"It is my opinion\"). Also, the structure shifts from a direct statement to a more formal phrasing. So perhaps the task is to rephrase statements into a more objective or formal tone, using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\"?\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" The key change here is replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Both mean something is not true, but \"fabricated\" sounds more official. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal or precise vocabulary?\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The original is a colloquial expression, and the output is a more direct statement. So perhaps the task is to convert informal or conversational language into more standard English, possibly by restructuring the sentence or using different verbs.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might be asking the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version. Let's check if there's a common thread here.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n- Formal structure (like using \"it is my opinion\")\n- Replacement of contractions (can't stand → cannot tolerate)\n- Changing phrasal verbs (made up → fabricated)\n- Restructuring sentences (I considered... → Various approaches were considered)\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal or standardized version, using appropriate grammar, vocabulary, and structure.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about converting first-person perspectives to third-person, or using more neutral language. But the fifth example shows that even the entire sentence structure is changed. For instance, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a different structure.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more objective or less personal. For example, the first input becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" which is more about the action than the speaker's thoughts. Similarly, the second input removes \"I\" and uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a stronger statement.\n\nWait, but the third input changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is a shift from first-person to third-person, making it more formal. The fourth input replaces \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" which is a more precise term. The fifth input changes the entire sentence structure from \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct statement.\n\nSo combining all these transformations, the instruction likely asks to rephrase each input into a more formal, objective, or grammatically correct version. The key elements are:\n\n1. Formality: Using more formal language, avoiding contractions, and possibly changing pronouns.\n2. Precision: Replacing informal or vague terms with more accurate ones (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\").\n3. Structure: Adjusting sentence structure to be more declarative or objective.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction probably was: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and precise version, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\"\n\nBut let me verify if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe it's about translating into another language, but the outputs don't seem to be translations. Alternatively, it could be about summarizing the main point, but the outputs are exact paraphrases, not summaries.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to convert first-person statements into third-person, but the first example does that, but others don't. Wait, the first input is \"I considered...\" and the output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" but the verb remains \"were considered.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a way that emphasizes the object rather than the subject.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase using passive voice. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: \"I considered many approaches.\" Passive: \"Many approaches were considered.\" Which matches the output. Then, the second input: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"His temper cannot be tolerated\" (passive?), but the output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Hmm, not exactly passive. The third input: \"I think that this is interesting\" → \"This is considered interesting\" (passive?), but the output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Not sure.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up\" → \"The entire story was fabricated\" (active voice, but replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated\").\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" So maybe not passive.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase using different tenses. But the tenses here are mostly present simple, so not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again:\n\n1. Input: I considered... → Output: Various approaches were considered. So the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"approaches,\" and the verb is in passive voice? Or maybe it's just a rephrasing where the focus is on the approaches rather than the speaker.\n\nSimilarly, the second input: \"I can't stand his temper\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The structure is similar, just replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\nThird input: \"I think that...\" → \"It is my opinion that...\" So changing the perspective from first-person to third-person, and using a more formal phrase.\n\nFourth input: \"was made up\" → \"was fabricated.\" Replacing the idiom with a synonym.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" Changing the entire sentence structure from \"I [verb] what you said\" to \"I [verb] you.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or objective version, possibly using different structures, more precise vocabulary, and avoiding contractions or informal expressions.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction is to convert the sentences into their passive voice equivalents. Let's check:\n\n1. Original: I considered many approaches. Passive: Many approaches were considered. Yes, that matches the output.\n\n2. Original: I can't stand his temper. Passive: His temper cannot be stood (doesn't make sense). So maybe not passive.\n\n3. Original: I think that this is interesting. Passive: This is thought to be interesting. But the output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So not passive.\n\n4. Original: The whole story was made up. Passive: The entire story was made up. Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So replacing \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n\n5. Original: I got what you said. Passive: What you said was got. Doesn't make sense. So not passive.\n\nHmm, so passive isn't the main factor here. Then what's the common thread?\n\nLooking back, the first output is passive, the second is a synonym replacement, the third is a structural change to third person and adding \"my opinion,\" the fourth is a synonym replacement, and the fifth is a structural change to a more direct statement.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or objective version, possibly using different structures, more precise vocabulary, and avoiding contractions or informal expressions. The key is to make the language more formal, precise, and structured.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and precise version, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Convert each sentence into its passive voice equivalent where possible, and replace informal expressions with more formal alternatives.\"\n\nBut the first example is passive, the second is a synonym, third is structural change, fourth is synonym, fifth is structural change. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could involve various transformations depending on the original sentence.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more objective. For example, the first input is about the speaker's action, but the output is about the approaches being considered. The third input's output shifts from \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is more objective. The fifth input's output is a direct statement without \"you said,\" making it more about understanding rather than reporting what was said.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the sentences in a more objective manner, removing subjective elements and using more formal language.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal and objective version, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary, and avoid contractions or informal expressions.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and precise version**, focusing on several key transformations:\n\n1. **Formality"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a slightly modified version of the input. My job is to determine the common rule or transformation that applies to all these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. → Output: She resembles her sister.\n   - The verb \"looks\" is changed to \"resembles\". Both mean similar, but \"resembles\" might be more formal or specific.\n\n2. Input: I think that this is interesting. → Output: It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n   - The structure here changes from first-person (\"I think\") to a more indirect statement using \"It is my opinion\".\n\n3. Input: I got what you said. → Output: I understood you.\n   - The phrase \"got what you said\" is simplified to \"understood you\". Maybe shortening or rephrasing for clarity.\n\n4. Input: See you tonight. → Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n   - The casual greeting is transformed into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n\n5. Input: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful. → Output: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\n   - Here, the relative clause uses \"I met\" in the input, and the output uses \"whom\" instead of \"who\". So changing the relative pronoun from \"who\" to \"whom\" when appropriate.\n\nNow, looking at these transformations, they seem to involve different aspects:\n\n- Changing verbs (like \"looks\" to \"resembles\")\n- Restructuring sentences (from \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\")\n- Simplifying phrasing (\"got what you said\" to \"understood you\")\n- Formalizing greetings (\"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting\")\n- Adjusting relative pronouns (\"who\" to \"whom\")\n\nHmm. Each example has a different type of transformation. But maybe there's a common thread. Let's think about possible instructions that could cover all these cases.\n\nOne possibility is that the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a more formal or polite way. For example, replacing contractions, using more formal language, or restructuring sentences. However, not all examples fit that. For instance, the third input is simplified, which might be the opposite of formalizing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into a more indirect or less direct form. Like turning statements into reported speech or using more polite expressions. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Not sure if that's indirect.\n\nSecond input: \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" which is a more indirect way of expressing the same idea.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said\" is simplified to \"I understood you.\" That's more direct, not indirect.\n\nFourth input: \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more formal and indirect way.\n\nFifth input: Changing \"who\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause. That's a grammatical adjustment, perhaps making it more formal.\n\nSo some examples are about formality, others about grammar, others about simplification. This makes it tricky. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a way that is more polite or formal, but also considering grammar rules like relative pronouns.\n\nWait, the fifth example specifically changes \"who\" to \"whom\". That's a grammatical correction. So maybe the instruction was to correct grammatical errors in the input. But then why does the second example change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\"? That doesn't seem like a grammatical error. Similarly, the first example changes \"looks\" to \"resembles\", which isn't a grammatical error either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more formal by replacing certain words or phrases. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal verbs, etc. Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, \"looks\" is replaced with \"resembles\". \"Resembles\" is more formal than \"looks\". In the second example, \"I think\" is replaced with \"It is my opinion\", which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Third example, \"got what you said\" is simplified, which might be less formal. Fourth example, \"See you\" is turned into a more formal expression. Fifth example, \"who\" to \"whom\" is a grammatical adjustment for formality.\n\nBut the third example doesn't fit the formalization pattern. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a more formal or polite manner, but allowing for some simplifications where necessary. However, the third example's output is simpler, which contradicts that.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all seem to be more concise or use different structures. For example, the first output is shorter than the input. The second output is longer but structured differently. The third is shorter. The fourth is longer. The fifth is slightly longer but with a different relative pronoun.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to shorten the sentence or make it more concise. But the fourth example becomes longer. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms. For example, \"looks\" → \"resembles\", \"think\" → \"opinion\", \"got\" → \"understood\", \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting\", \"met\" → \"whom met\". But this approach would require identifying which words to replace. However, the fifth example replaces \"who\" with \"whom\", which is a different part of speech.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to adjust the sentence structure based on certain rules. For example, changing reported speech structure, adjusting subject-verb agreement, or using different pronouns.\n\nLooking at the second example: \"I think that this is interesting\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This is a common way to rephrase \"I think\" into a more formal structure. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I think\" as \"It is my opinion\" whenever it appears. But then why does the first example change \"looks\" to \"resembles\"? That doesn't fit the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into a more indirect or reported speech form. For example, changing direct statements into reported ones. But the first example doesn't fit that. \"She looks like her sister\" is a statement, not a direct quote. So converting that to reported speech would be \"She said that she looks like her sister,\" but the output is \"She resembles her sister.\" So that doesn't match.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs sometimes use \"my\" in the second example. Maybe the instruction was to add possessive adjectives where appropriate. But the first example doesn't have that.\n\nWait, the second output is \"It is my opinion...\", which introduces \"my\". So maybe the instruction was to insert possessive adjectives when expressing opinions. But the first example's output doesn't have that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more polite by adding \"please\" or \"kindly\", but none of the outputs include those.\n\nLooking back at the fifth example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the relative pronoun is changed from \"who\" to \"whom\". This is a grammatical correction. So perhaps the instruction was to correct the use of relative pronouns between \"who\" and \"whom\" in the input sentences.\n\nBut then why does the first example change \"looks\" to \"resembles\"? That's not a relative pronoun issue. Similarly, the second example's output doesn't involve relative pronouns. The third example's output is a simplification, not a grammatical correction. The fourth example's output is a greeting converted into a formal expression, which doesn't involve relative pronouns.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might not be uniform across all examples. But the user says the instruction was the same for all. So perhaps there's a common element among all these transformations.\n\nLet me consider each example again:\n\n1. \"looks\" → \"resembles\": Maybe replacing informal verbs with more formal ones.\n2. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\": Changing first-person to a more formal structure.\n3. \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\": Simplifying the phrasing.\n4. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting\": Polite greeting.\n5. \"who\" → \"whom\": Correcting relative pronoun usage.\n\nSo each example involves a different kind of transformation. How can these all be covered by a single instruction?\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each sentence in a way that is more formal or polite, but also correcting any grammatical errors. However, the third example doesn't involve a grammatical error. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to adjust the sentence structure according to certain rules, such as converting reported speech, adjusting subject-verb agreement, or using different pronouns.\n\nWait, the second example's output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" This is a common way to rephrase \"I think\" into a more formal structure. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase \"I think\" as \"It is my opinion\" whenever it appears. But then why does the first example change \"looks\" to \"resembles\"? That doesn't fit the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each sentence into a more indirect or reported speech form. For<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n2. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nLooking at these, each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. Let's break down each pair:\n\n1. The first input uses \"considered many approaches,\" and the output uses \"various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject-verb structure is changed. The original is \"I considered\" (active voice) becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive voice). Also, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" which are synonyms but not exact. Wait, maybe \"various\" is more formal? Or perhaps the output is using a more formal phrasing.\n\n2. Second input: \"was made up\" becomes \"was fabricated.\" Again, \"made up\" is informal, while \"fabricated\" is more formal. So replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts.\n\n3. Third input: \"I met yesterday\" becomes \"whom I met yesterday.\" Here, the input uses the possessive \"I met,\" and the output uses \"whom I met.\" So changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause. But wait, the original is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the subject of the relative clause changes from \"I\" to \"whom.\" That's a grammatical change, perhaps making it more formal or correct?\n\n4. Fourth input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common expression where the informal greeting is transformed into a more polite response. So replacing \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you.\"\n\n5. Fifth input: \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Again, replacing informal phrasing with more formal terms. \"Can't tell\" vs. \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard English version, possibly correcting grammar, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, or adjusting sentence structure.\n\nWait, but let's check each example again to see if there's another angle. For example, the third input's output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" That's a significant grammatical change. In the original, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause, but in the output, \"whom\" is used as the object. So this might be a case of converting the possessive pronoun to an objective pronoun in the relative clause. But why would that happen? Maybe the original was incorrect, and the output corrects it. However, the original \"I met\" is grammatically correct. So perhaps the instruction is to make the sentence more formal by changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in the relative clause. But that's a specific case. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the possessive pronoun to an objective form when it's part of a relative clause. But that seems like a very specific rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, replacing contractions (\"can't\" with \"find it hard to\"), using more formal verbs (made up → fabricated), changing sentence parts (active to passive, etc.).\n\nLooking at all the outputs, they seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. Let's verify each:\n\n1. Original: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\" The output uses \"various\" instead of \"many,\" which is more formal. Also, the passive voice is used here. So the instruction might be to rephrase into a more formal style, possibly using passive voice, more formal adjectives, etc.\n\n2. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Entire\" is more formal than \"whole,\" and \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" but more formal.\n\n3. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"whom\" is used instead of \"I\" in the relative clause. So changing the pronoun from subject to object case. But why would that be necessary? Unless the original was incorrect. Wait, the original is \"I met,\" which is correct. Changing to \"whom\" would be incorrect unless there's a specific reason. Maybe the instruction is to use \"whom\" in relative clauses after certain prepositions? But in this case, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause, so \"whom\" isn't needed. This seems like a possible error in the output. Unless the instruction was to convert \"I\" to \"whom\" in such cases, but that's not standard. So maybe this is a mistake in the output, but since the user provided these pairs, we have to work with them.\n\n4. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common transformation where the informal greeting is turned into a more polite response. So the instruction might include converting informal greetings into more formal expressions.\n\n5. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" Again, replacing informal \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is more formal.\n\nSo considering all these, the instruction likely involves rephrasing each input into a more formal or standard English version, possibly correcting grammar, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, adjusting sentence structure (like changing active to passive voice, using more formal adjectives, etc.), and in some cases, changing pronouns (like \"I\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses, though that's unclear).\n\nBut the third example is tricky because changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" is not standard. Unless the original input had a grammatical error. For instance, if the input was \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" and the instruction was to correct the pronoun case in the relative clause. But \"I met\" is correct; \"whom\" would be incorrect unless the clause is after a preposition. Wait, no. The relative clause \"I met yesterday\" is modifying \"lawyer.\" The subject of the relative clause is \"I,\" which is correct. So changing to \"whom\" would be wrong. Therefore, this might indicate that the output is incorrect, but since the user provided these pairs, perhaps the instruction was to use \"whom\" in such cases, which is not standard. Alternatively, maybe the input was different. Wait, looking back at the input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction might have been to insert \"whom\" before the relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the possessive pronoun to an objective form when it's part of a relative clause. But that's not a standard rule. So perhaps this is an error in the output, but since the user included it, we have to consider that the instruction might have been something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, and in the third example, the output is just a more formal version without changing the pronoun. But the output does change \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" which is not standard. So perhaps the instruction was to use \"whom\" in the relative clause, but that's not correct. This inconsistency makes me think that maybe the third example is an exception, or perhaps the instruction was different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the possessive pronoun to an objective form when it's the subject of the relative clause. But in this case, \"I met\" is the subject, so \"whom\" shouldn't be used. So this seems like a mistake in the output. But since the user provided these pairs, perhaps the instruction was to use \"whom\" in such cases, which is not standard. Alternatively, maybe the input was different. Wait, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" If the instruction was to change \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" that would be incorrect. So perhaps the output is wrong, but the user included it. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use \"whom\" in the relative clause regardless of the position. But that's not a standard rule.\n\nThis suggests that either the instruction includes a specific rule about changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in relative clauses, which is not standard, or there's a mistake in the output. Since the user provided these pairs, we have to work with them. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, and in the third example, the<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. My job is to determine the common rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\nInputs:\n1. \"I think that this is interesting.\"\n   Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\n2. \"Thanks for your help.\"\n   Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n\n3. \"This song is fire.\"\n   Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\n4. \"I can't stand his temper.\"\n   Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\n5. \"She looks like her sister.\"\n   Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\nLooking at these, I notice that each output is a more formal or polite version of the input. Let's break them down:\n\n1. The first input uses \"think\" which is informal. The output replaces it with \"my opinion,\" making it more formal.\n2. \"Thanks\" is casual, replaced with \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is more polite and formal.\n3. \"Fire\" is slang for \"amazing.\" The output uses \"incredibly good,\" a more standard expression.\n4. \"Can't stand\" is informal; the output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" which is more formal and less direct.\n5. \"Looks like\" is a colloquial expression. The output uses \"resembles,\" which is a more precise and formal term.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be replacing informal or slang expressions with more formal, polite, or standard phrasing. Let me check if there's another angle. Maybe it's about changing the subject's perspective? For example, the first input is \"I think...\" and the output starts with \"It is my opinion...\" which shifts the subject from first person to third person and adds \"my opinion,\" but that might not apply to all cases. The second input is \"Thanks\" (second person) becoming \"Your assistance\" (second person but more formal). Third input is \"fire\" (slang) to \"incredibly good.\" Fourth is \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate.\" Fifth is \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\"\n\nAnother thought: maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal or polite response. For example, in social interactions, people often adjust their language based on context. So the friend was instructed to make the output more polite or formal than the input.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against each pair:\n\n1. Input is casual (\"I think\"), output is formal (\"It is my opinion\").\n2. \"Thanks\" is informal, output is formal and uses \"assistance\" instead of \"help.\"\n3. \"Fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good.\"\n4. \"Can't stand\" is informal, replaced with \"cannot tolerate.\"\n5. \"Looks like\" is casual, replaced with \"resembles.\"\n\nYes, all these transformations seem to fit the idea of making the output more formal or polite. So the instruction likely asked the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more standard English expression, avoiding slang or contractions.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with synonyms. Let's see:\n\n- \"think\" → \"opinion\"\n- \"help\" → \"assistance\"\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"\n- \"stand\" → \"tolerate\"\n- \"looks like\" → \"resembles\"\n\nBut synonyms don't exactly fit here because some are phrases. However, \"fire\" as slang for \"amazing\" isn't a direct synonym. So maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with more standard ones, possibly using a thesaurus or a set of rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal tone, such as replacing contractions (if any), but none of the inputs have contractions except maybe \"can't stand,\" which is a contraction. The output uses \"cannot tolerate,\" so that's replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot.\" Similarly, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way of expressing agreement.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs sometimes add more words or phrases. For example, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" adds \"much appreciated\" compared to \"Thanks for your help.\" But that's part of making it more polite rather than just adding words.\n\nSo putting it all together, the most plausible instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. This would explain all the transformations. Let me verify once more:\n\n- Input 1: Casual \"I think\" → Formal \"It is my opinion.\"\n- Input 2: Informal \"Thanks\" → Polite \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n- Input 3: Slang \"fire\" → Standard \"incredibly good.\"\n- Input 4: Informal \"can't stand\" → Formal \"cannot tolerate.\"\n- Input 5: Colloquial \"looks like\" → Precise \"resembles.\"\n\nAll these changes align with making the output more formal, polite, or standard. Therefore, the instruction was likely something like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version\" or \"Convert informal expressions into more standard phrasing.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**. This involved replacing informal expressions, slang, or contractions with more standard, formal alternatives. Here's how the instruction applies to each input-output pair:\n\n1. **Input**: \"I think that this is interesting.\"  \n   **Output**: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"  \n   *Formalization*: Replaced \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\" to shift perspective and use a more formal structure.\n\n2. **Input**: \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n   **Output**: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n   *Politeness*: Exchanged the casual \"Thanks\" with a more formal and appreciative phrase.\n\n3. **Input**: \"This song is fire.\"  \n   **Output**: \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n   *Standardization*: Substituted slang \"fire\" with the conventional \"incredibly good.\"\n\n4. **Input**: \"I can't stand his temper.\"  \n   **Output**: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n   *Formalization*: Replaced the informal \"can't stand\" with the more formal \"cannot tolerate.\"\n\n5. **Input**: \"She looks like her sister.\"  \n   **Output**: \"She resembles her sister.\"  \n   *Precision*: Exchanged the colloquial \"looks like\" with the more accurate \"resembles.\"\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, converting informal expressions, slang, or contractions into standard, polite language.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a more formal or polite version of the input. So, the instruction probably asks the friend to rephrase the given sentence in a more polite or formal way. Let me check each pair to see if that makes sense.\n\nFirst input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Hmm, both are correct, but the output is more formal. Maybe the instruction was to make it more formal? But wait, \"fabricated\" is already a synonym. Maybe not. Let's move on.\n\nSecond input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Oh, right, \"fire\" is slang for something cool or awesome. The output replaces that with a more formal compliment. So maybe the instruction was to translate informal expressions into more polite equivalents.\n\nThird input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Again, \"resembles\" is a more formal way to say \"looks like.\" So perhaps the task is to use more formal vocabulary.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the output turns a casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase casual phrases into more polite or professional language.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Both mean the same thing, but \"tolerate\" is more formal than \"can't stand.\" So again, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely asks the friend to take each input (which uses informal or casual language) and rephrase it using more formal or polite terms. Each output example fits this pattern. So the instruction might have been something like: \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal or polite language.\" Alternatively, maybe it's about converting slang or colloquialisms into more standard English. Let me verify if there's another possible angle.\n\nWait, another thought: Could the instruction be about making the sentences more positive or less negative? For example, \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is slightly different in tone but not necessarily more positive. The first input's output is a synonym but not necessarily more positive. The second input changes \"fire\" (positive slang) to \"incredibly good\" (still positive but more formal). Third input is just a synonym. Fourth input changes \"see you\" to a more formal expression of looking forward. Fifth input is a synonym. So the main pattern is replacing informal or slang expressions with more formal alternatives, especially in greetings and statements of opinion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the inputs into more polite forms, like changing direct commands or requests into more polite phrasing. But none of the outputs seem to fit that. For example, \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you,\" which is a response rather than a direct statement. So that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs sometimes use \"I\" where the inputs don't. Like the fourth input doesn't use \"I,\" but the output does. So maybe the instruction was to add \"I\" when appropriate. But the fifth input's output also adds \"I,\" so that's possible. However, the third input's output doesn't add \"I,\" so that might not be the case. Let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"The whole story...\" Output starts with \"The entire...\" so no \"I.\"\n\nInput 2: \"This song...\" Output starts with \"This song...\" no \"I.\"\n\nInput 3: \"She looks...\" Output starts with \"She resembles...\" no \"I.\"\n\nInput 4: \"See you...\" Output starts with \"I look forward...\" So here, \"I\" is added.\n\nInput 5: \"I can't stand...\" Output starts with \"I cannot...\" So \"I\" is present in both outputs where the input had it, and added in the fourth input.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to add \"I\" when the original didn't have it, but that's inconsistent because input 3 and 2 don't have \"I\" but outputs don't either. So that's not the main instruction.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to make the sentences more formal by replacing contractions. For example, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" \"see you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you,\" etc. That's part of the pattern. Also, replacing informal terms like \"fire\" with \"incredibly good,\" \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like,\" etc.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the most likely instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence using more formal or polite language, replacing informal or slang expressions with their more standard equivalents.\" Or more specifically, \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal terms with synonyms or more appropriate phrasing.\"\n\nLet me check if there's any other possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more positive. But the first input's output is a synonym, not necessarily more positive. The second input's output is more positive but still fits the formal change. The third input's output is neutral. The fourth input's output is more formal and positive. The fifth input's output is a synonym. So positivity isn't the main factor.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to turn the inputs into more polite versions, like changing direct statements into more indirect or formal expressions. For example, \"See you tonight\" becomes a statement of looking forward, which is a more polite way to express anticipation. Similarly, \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper,\" which is a bit more formal but not necessarily more polite. Wait, \"tolerate\" is more formal than \"stand,\" but \"can't stand\" vs. \"cannot tolerate\" are similar in formality. Maybe the instruction was to replace \"can't\" with \"cannot\" for formality, but that's not the case in all examples. For instance, \"I can't stand\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate,\" which uses \"cannot\" but adds \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace informal verbs with more formal ones, even if they're not exact synonyms.\n\nIn summary, the instruction seems to be asking the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal or slang expressions with their more standard or polite equivalents. This would explain all the output examples provided.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version** by replacing informal or slang expressions with their more standard or polite equivalents. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Formal Synonyms**: Outputs often use formal synonyms (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" \"incredibly good\" instead of \"fire\").\n2. **Polite Phrasing**: Casual or direct statements are softened (e.g., \"I look forward to meeting you\" instead of \"See you tonight\").\n3. **Avoidance of Slang/Colloquialisms**: Informal terms like \"fire\" and contractions (\"can't\") are replaced with more formal alternatives.\n\n### Example Breakdown:\n- **Input**: \"This song is fire.\"  \n  **Output**: \"This song is incredibly good.\"  \n  *Slang (\"fire\") → Formal compliment.*\n\n- **Input**: \"I can't stand his temper.\"  \n  **Output**: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n  *Contractions (\"can't\") → Formal \"cannot\"; \"tolerate\" → more polite than \"stand.\"*\n\n- **Input**: \"See you tonight.\"  \n  **Output**: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"  \n  *Casual greeting → Polite anticipation.*\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe instruction was:  \n**\"Rewrite each sentence using more formal or polite language, replacing informal or slang expressions with their more standard equivalents.\"**\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input has a corresponding output, so I need to find a pattern or rule that transforms the input into the output. Let me go through each pair one by one and see if I can spot any commonalities.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". That sounds like replacing \"once you get there\" with a more formal phrase. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase informal expressions into more polite or standard English?\n\nLooking at the second pair:\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\nHere, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing certain adjectives or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\nOutput: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\nThis seems like a completely different structure. The original is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using specific phrasing like \"it is suggested that no action should be taken\"?\n\nFourth input-output:\nInput: The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\nOutput: The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\nHere, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\". So changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom\" in a relative clause. That might be part of a grammar rule, like converting possessive pronouns to objective case when necessary.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: She looks like her sister.\nOutput: She resembles her sister.\n\"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". So replacing the verb phrase with a synonym.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what could the original instruction be? Let's see:\n\n1. The first example changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\". This could be part of a rule to replace informal expressions with more formal ones.\n2. The second example replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So maybe replacing certain adjectives or phrases with their more formal counterparts.\n3. The third example turns a negative statement into a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using that structure.\n4. The fourth example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". This is a grammar rule where in a relative clause, the possessive pronoun should be replaced with the objective case when the relative pronoun is used. For example, \"the man I saw\" vs. \"the man whom I saw\".\n5. The fifth example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles\". So replacing common verb phrases with synonyms.\n\nWait, but how do these all fit under a single instruction? Let's check if there's a common thread. The first four examples seem to involve different types of transformations, but maybe they're all part of a larger set of rules. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate or rephrase the input into a more formal or standardized version, possibly following specific style guides.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, some of them use more formal language (like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\"), others use synonyms (\"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"), and others change sentence structure entirely (\"it is suggested that...\"). But how to connect all these?\n\nAnother angle: the outputs sometimes use more formal or academic language. For example, replacing contractions (if any) with full forms, but none of the inputs have contractions. Alternatively, changing \"I\" to \"me\" in certain contexts, which is part of the fourth example.\n\nWait, the fourth example is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That's a grammar rule where in a relative clause, the subject pronoun \"I\" should be replaced with the objective case \"me\" when the relative pronoun is used. For example, \"The person who I met\" vs. \"The person whom I met\". So that's a specific grammatical correction.\n\nBut then why does the third example turn a negative statement into a suggestion? That seems like a different type of transformation. Unless the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions, which would explain the third example. But then the other examples don't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to apply multiple transformations based on different criteria. For instance, the first example uses a synonym phrase, the second uses a synonym, the third rephrases the entire sentence structure, the fourth corrects grammar, and the fifth uses a synonym. But that seems too varied.\n\nWait, let's look again at the third example. The input is \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So the original is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a positive suggestion phrased as a recommendation. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations using the structure \"it is suggested that...\" followed by a negative prohibition (\"no action should be taken\") instead of the original negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\").\n\nBut then why does the first example not fit that? The first example is a positive statement (\"Please call once you get there\") transformed into a more formal version. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase both positive and negative statements into more formal versions, but the third example is a special case where the negative is turned into a suggestion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal register, using specific phrases like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\", \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", etc., and also rephrasing the third input into a suggestion structure. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, another thought: the outputs sometimes use \"your\" (second example), \"yourself\" (if any), but in the first example, \"your arrival\" is added. Maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives, often involving \"your\" or similar possessives.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, some use \"your\" (second example), \"you\" (in the first example as \"upon your arrival\"), \"whom\" (fourth example), \"resembles\" (fifth), \"fabricated\" (second). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to apply multiple transformations: for example, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\" (formalizing), replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" (grammatical correction), and replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles\" (synonym). But how to connect these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal or academic style, using specific substitutions and rephrasing. For example, replacing colloquial expressions with more formal ones, using synonyms, adjusting grammar, etc.\n\nBut the third example seems to be a complete restructuring of the sentence. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, possibly using specific phrases like \"it is suggested that...\", adjusting grammar, replacing certain words with synonyms, etc.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs sometimes use \"your\" (second example), \"you\" (first example), \"whom\" (fourth), \"resembles\" (fifth), \"fabricated\" (second), \"upon your arrival\" (first), \"it is suggested that...\" (third), \"was helpful\" remains the same (fourth), \"was helpful\" same (fifth). Not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the third example again. The input is a negative statement: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is a positive suggestion: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So the instruction might be to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using that structure. But why does the first example not fit that? Because the first example is a positive statement being rephrased into a more formal version, not a suggestion.\n\nHmm. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, which includes various transformations like replacing informal expressions with formal ones, using synonyms, adjusting grammar, and rephrasing entire sentences when necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to translate the input into a more formal version, using specific phrases like \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\", \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\", \"whom\" instead of \"I\" in the relative clause, and \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\".\n\nBut how to connect all these into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to apply multiple transformations based on specific rules. For example:\n\n- Replace \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\".\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n- Change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n- Replace \"looks like\" with \"resembles\".\n\nBut that's a list of specific replacements, which might not be generalizable. However, the problem states that the instruction was given once, and<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let's start by listing them again:\n\n1. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone? Let's check each example:\n\nFirst input: The original is a statement expressing hesitation. The output is a suggestion phrased formally (\"It is suggested...\"). So maybe the instruction was to convert statements into polite suggestions using formal language.\n\nSecond input: A question asking if the speaker should go along. The output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way to ask for permission, replacing \"do you want me to...\" with a more polite form.\n\nThird input: A casual greeting (\"See you\") becomes a more formal expression of anticipation (\"look forward to meeting you\").\n\nFourth input: A simple statement about the story being made up becomes \"was fabricated,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal or precise.\n\nFifth input: The original uses \"whom\" in a relative clause, but the output also uses \"whom\" instead of \"who.\" Wait, the input here is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change here is replacing \"I\" with \"me\" in the relative clause? Wait, no. Wait, the original has \"I met yesterday,\" and the output has \"whom I met yesterday.\" Wait, no, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the difference is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" Wait, but \"whom\" is the objective case. So the input uses \"I\" (subject) and the output uses \"whom\" (object). So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition in a relative clause. But looking at the other examples, like the third input: \"See you tonight\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" That's a different structure. So maybe not all outputs are direct replacements. Let's check the fifth input again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause. So perhaps the instruction was to convert any occurrence of \"I\" in the input to \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition in a relative clause. But wait, in the first example, there's no \"I\" to replace. Second example, no \"I\". Third example, \"I\" is replaced with \"me\"? Wait, no. Third input is \"See you tonight.\" Output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So the input is a greeting, output is a more formal response. So maybe the instruction was to transform certain phrases into more formal equivalents. Let's see:\n\nFirst example: Convert a statement of hesitation into a polite suggestion. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a formal suggestion using \"it is suggested that\" structure.\n\nSecond example: Convert questions like \"Do you want me to...\" into \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way to ask for permission.\n\nThird example: Convert casual greetings into more formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nFourth example: Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal.\n\nFifth example: Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause where \"I\" is the object of the preposition \"met.\" So the instruction might have been to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it's the object of a preposition in a relative clause.\n\nBut then why does the fourth example not fit into that? Because the fourth example is a direct replacement of \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction had multiple parts. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to perform several transformations depending on the context. For example:\n\n- If the input is a statement expressing hesitation, rephrase it as a formal suggestion.\n- If the input is a question starting with \"Do you want me to...\", rephrase it as \"Shall I...\"\n- If the input is a casual greeting, rephrase it into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n- Replace \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the object of a preposition.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using specific structures like suggestions, questions, or formal expressions. Let's check each input-output pair again:\n\n1. Input: Statement of hesitation → Output: Formal suggestion.\n2. Input: Question asking for permission → Output: Formal question using \"Shall I...\"\n3. Input: Casual greeting → Output: Formal anticipation.\n4. Input: Simple statement → Output: Synonym substitution (\"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n5. Input: Relative clause with \"I\" → Output: \"whom\" instead of \"I\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve different transformations depending on the type of input. For example:\n\n- If the input is a statement expressing reluctance, rephrase it as a formal suggestion.\n- If the input is a question asking for permission, rephrase it as a formal request using \"Shall I...\"\n- If the input is a casual greeting, rephrase it into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n- If the input contains \"made up,\" replace it with \"fabricated.\"\n- If the input has a relative clause with \"I\" as the subject of the verb in the relative clause, replace \"I\" with \"who.\" Wait, but in the fifth example, the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the \"I\" is the subject of \"met,\" so in the relative clause, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" So perhaps the rule is: In relative clauses where \"I\" is the subject of the verb in the relative clause, replace \"I\" with \"whom.\" But in the first example, there's no such structure. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" whenever it's the subject of a verb in a relative clause. But in the fifth example, \"I met\" is the subject of \"met,\" so replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" gives \"whom met,\" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the original is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" Wait, no. The original is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" Wait, no, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output changes \"I\" to \"whom.\" So the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the \"I\" is replaced with \"whom,\" making the relative clause \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the rule here is replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in the relative clause when it's the subject of the verb in the relative clause. But in the first example, there's no such structure. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the subject of the verb in the relative clause. But in the fifth example, the relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" so replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" would give \"whom met yesterday,\" but the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" Wait, no. The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the \"I\" is still there. Wait, no. The original is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the \"I\" is replaced with \"whom.\" So the structure is \"The lawyer [relative clause] was helpful.\" The relative clause is \"I met yesterday,\" and the output is \"whom I met yesterday.\" So the \"I\" is replaced with \"whom.\" Therefore, the rule is: In relative clauses where \"I\" is the subject of the verb in the relative clause, replace \"I\" with \"whom.\" But in the first example, there's no such structure. So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses where \"I\" is the subject of the verb in the relative clause<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the rule or transformation applied here. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input: \"Thanks for your help.\" The output is \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So here, the original sentence starts with \"Thanks for your [help].\" The output seems to rephrase it into a more formal or polite expression. The key elements here might be changing the subject (from \"your help\" to \"Your assistance\") and adding \"is much appreciated.\"\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the question is transformed. The original uses \"want me to go,\" which is a request. The output uses \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or offering to assist. The structure changes from a present tense question to a past tense modal (\"Shall I...\").\n\nThird input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a greeting turned into a statement expressing anticipation. The original is casual, while the output is more formal and uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you.\"\n\nFourth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The original uses \"can't stand,\" which is informal and expresses strong dislike. The output replaces \"stand\" with \"tolerate,\" maintaining the negative connotation but using a more formal verb.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the original is a simple confirmation. The output rephrases it using \"understood\" and removes the object \"what you said,\" making it more concise and direct.\n\nNow, looking for common patterns across all these transformations. Let's list possible categories:\n\n1. **Formalization**: Many outputs seem more formal than the inputs. For example, \"Your assistance\" vs. \"your help,\" \"accompany\" vs. \"go with,\" \"look forward to\" vs. \"see you.\"\n2. **Politeness**: The outputs often use more polite phrasing. \"Shall I...\" instead of \"Do you want me to...\" \"Much appreciated\" adds emphasis.\n3. **Rephrasing Common Phrases**: Each input has a common phrase or expression that's being rephrased. For instance, \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate,\" \"got what you said\" → \"understood you.\"\n4. **Subject-Object Shifts**: In some cases, the subject shifts. Like \"your help\" becomes \"Your assistance,\" changing the possessive to a noun phrase.\n5. **Tense and Modality**: The second input changes \"want\" to \"Shall I accompany,\" which is a past tense modal. The fourth input changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" keeping the negative but using a different verb form.\n\nAnother angle: checking if there's a specific translation or adaptation style. For example, the third input's output is a common way to respond to \"See you later\" in a more formal context. Similarly, the fourth input's output is a more formal way of expressing disagreement or disapproval.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, possibly using synonyms or different structures. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nFirst example fits: \"Thanks for your help\" → formal and polite. Second example: \"Do you want me to...\" → \"Shall I...\" which is more formal. Third: casual greeting to formal anticipation. Fourth: informal \"can't stand\" to formal \"cannot tolerate.\" Fifth: \"Got what you said\" to \"understood you,\" which is more direct and formal.\n\nBut could there be another pattern? Let's see. The outputs sometimes use \"I\" where the input doesn't. For example, the first output starts with \"Your assistance,\" but the input starts with \"Thanks for your...\" So maybe the instruction was to turn the input into a statement starting with \"Your [noun]\" or similar. But the fifth input's output starts with \"I understood you,\" which contradicts that. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal, polite response, possibly using certain phrases like \"Your assistance,\" \"accompany,\" etc. But how does that apply to all examples?\n\nLooking at the second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" The structure here is changing the question from a present tense (\"want\") to a past tense modal (\"Shall I...\"). That's a specific transformation. Similarly, the fourth input changes \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a direct synonym but in a different form.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal version using specific vocabulary. For example, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" \"got what you said\" with \"understood,\" \"do you want me to\" with \"shall I accompany,\" etc. But why would the first input's output start with \"Your assistance\"? That seems like a different structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, using certain key phrases. For example, replacing \"thanks\" with \"much appreciated,\" \"want me to\" with \"accompany,\" \"see you\" with \"look forward to,\" etc. But how do these fit across all examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to take each input and transform it into a more formal, polite version by using specific expressions. For instance, turning requests into offers, informal phrases into more formal ones, etc.\n\nLet me check the outputs again:\n\n1. Input: Thanks for your help. Output: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n   - Here, \"your help\" becomes \"Your assistance,\" and \"Thanks\" becomes \"is much appreciated.\"\n\n2. Input: Do you want me to go with you? Output: Shall I accompany you?\n   - \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way of asking for permission or offering help.\n\n3. Input: See you tonight. Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n   - Casual greeting becomes a formal expression of anticipation.\n\n4. Input: I can't stand his temper. Output: I cannot tolerate his temper.\n   - \"Can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate,\" maintaining the negative but using a different verb.\n\n5. Input: I got what you said. Output: I understood you.\n   - Simplifies and rephrases the confirmation.\n\nSo, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite version, possibly using specific transformations like changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" \"got what you said\" to \"understood,\" \"do you want me to\" to \"shall I accompany,\" etc. Additionally, the first example transforms \"your help\" into \"Your assistance,\" which is a more formal noun phrase.\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs often start with \"Your\" or \"I\" (in the third and fifth examples). Wait, the third output starts with \"I,\" but the input didn't. So maybe the instruction was to start the output with \"Your\" followed by a noun phrase, but that doesn't fit all examples. The fifth output starts with \"I,\" which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal, polite response by using certain key phrases. For example:\n\n- Replace \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\"\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood\"\n- Replace \"do you want me to\" with \"shall I...\"\n- Replace \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you\"\n- Replace \"thanks for your help\" with \"Your assistance is much appreciated\"\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nWait, looking at the first output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" The structure here is \"Your [noun] + is much appreciated.\" The input was \"Thanks for your help.\" So the instruction might have been to take the input, identify the noun or action expressed, and rephrase it as \"Your [noun] is much appreciated.\" But this only applies to the first input. The other examples don't fit this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version by using specific phrases. For example:\n\n- For expressions of gratitude, replace with \"Your [noun] is much appreciated.\"\n- For questions about accompaniment, replace with \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n- For greetings, replace with \"I look forward to meeting you.\"\n- For statements about inability to tolerate, replace with \"I cannot tolerate...\"\n- For confirmations, replace with \"I understood you.\"\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. There must be a more general instruction.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the outputs as translations or adaptations. For example, the first output is a translation into a more formal register. The second is a translation into a more polite form. The third is a translation into a more formal greeting. The fourth is a translation into a more formal complaint. The fifth is a simplification and rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal, polite version by using certain linguistic features:\n\n1. Use of \"Your\" instead of possessive pronouns.\n2. Use of \"I\" to express personal commitment.\n3. Formal verbs and phrases (e.g., \"accompany,\" \"look forward to\").\n<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied to each input.\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n4. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, I need to identify the common changes made from input to output. Let's analyze each pair:\n\n1. The first input uses \"I think\" and the output replaces it with \"It is my opinion\". So, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"It\", and the verb phrase is adjusted to \"is my opinion that...\".\n\n2. The second input uses \"can't tell the difference\" and the output becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". Here, the structure is similar but uses different phrasing. \"Can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard\", and \"difference\" becomes \"distinguish\".\n\n3. The third input is a group statement (\"We don't think...\") which is transformed into \"It is suggested...\". The original is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output rephrases it as a suggestion to take no action. The subject shifts from \"We\" to \"It\", and the verb changes from \"don't think\" to \"is suggested\".\n\n4. The fourth input is an informal expression \"fire\" (meaning great) which is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So, the output uses a more formal adjective instead of the slang term.\n\n5. The fifth input uses \"can't stand\" which is rephrased as \"cannot tolerate\". The structure here is changing the verb phrase from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\", keeping the subject \"I\" but using a synonym.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's categorize possible patterns:\n\n- **Subject Shift**: In some cases, the subject changes from \"I\" to \"It\" (like in the first example). But others don't involve this shift. For instance, the second input's subject remains \"I\", but the third example shifts to \"It\". So maybe not a universal rule.\n\n- **Formal vs. Informal Language**: The fourth example changes slang (\"fire\") to a more formal adjective. The fifth example changes \"can't stand\" to a more formal verb phrase. The first example adds \"my opinion\" to make it more formal. The third example rephrases a negative statement into a suggestion, which might be seen as more formal or indirect.\n\n- **Rephrasing Common Phrases**: The second example replaces \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\". Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". These are common phrases that are being rephrased into more formal or academic language.\n\n- **Changing Sentence Structure**: The third example changes \"We don't think...\" to \"It is suggested...\", altering the sentence structure entirely. The first example also changes the structure from \"I think that...\" to \"It is my opinion that...\".\n\nWait, but the third example's structure change is more significant. The original is a first-person statement, and the output is a passive voice statement with \"it is suggested\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect statement, possibly using passive voice or different phrasing.\n\nBut then why does the first example use \"my opinion\" instead of passive? Maybe the instruction is to make the statement more objective or to use a different phrasing that conveys the same meaning but in a more formal way.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or academic. For example, replacing contractions (\"can't\" with \"cannot\"), changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\", using more precise vocabulary (\"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference\"), rephrasing \"don't think\" into \"suggested no action\", and replacing slang with more standard adjectives.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic version, using more precise language, avoiding contractions, and replacing informal expressions with more standard phrasing.\n\nLet me check if that fits all examples:\n\n1. Original: \"I think...\" → Output: \"It is my opinion...\" – more formal, uses \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think\".\n\n2. Original: \"can't tell the difference\" → Output: \"find it hard to distinguish\" – more formal, uses \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't tell\".\n\n3. Original: \"don't think it's a good idea\" → Output: \"no action should be taken\" – rephrased as a suggestion, more formal.\n\n4. Original: \"fire\" → Output: \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with a more formal adjective.\n\n5. Original: \"can't stand\" → Output: \"cannot tolerate\" – replacing the verb phrase with a synonym, more formal.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. The instruction likely required converting each input into a more formal, academic, or indirect version, using appropriate vocabulary and phrasing to avoid contractions, slang, or first-person pronouns when necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or indirect form, but the examples don't all fit that. For example, the third example is a direct statement turned into a suggestion, which is more indirect but not necessarily polite.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to convert each input into a more objective or third-person perspective. For example, changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" (though the subject is still \"I\"). Wait, the first output is \"It is my opinion...\", so the subject is \"It\", but the opinion is attributed to \"I\". That's a bit confusing. How does that work?\n\nWait, in the first output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So the structure is \"It is [subject]'s opinion that [statement]\". So the original \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\". So the subject shifts from \"I\" to \"It\", but the opinion is still attributed to \"I\". That's an interesting transformation. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a similar structure, using \"It is my opinion that...\" for statements expressing personal belief.\n\nSimilarly, the second example: \"I can't tell the difference\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish\". So here, the structure is changed from \"I [can't] [verb]\" to \"I find it hard to [gerund]\". So the verb phrase is rephrased.\n\nThird example: \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that...\". So the original is a first-person plural statement, and the output is a passive suggestion.\n\nFourth example: \"This song is fire\" becomes \"This song is incredibly good\". Slang replaced with a more formal adjective.\n\nFifth example: \"I can't stand his temper\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper\". The verb phrase is changed from \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic style, using appropriate vocabulary and phrasing. Specifically, the instruction could have been to:\n\n- Replace contractions with their expanded forms (e.g., \"can't\" → \"cannot\").\n- Convert first-person pronouns (\"I\") into more formal phrasing (e.g., \"It is my opinion that...\").\n- Rephrase common informal expressions (e.g., \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\").\n- Replace slang terms with more standard adjectives (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n- Restructure sentences into more formal or indirect phrasing (e.g., \"We don't think...\" → \"It is suggested...\").\n\nAdditionally, the third example shows a shift from a first-person statement to a passive suggestion, which might indicate that the instruction required rephrasing the input into a more indirect or impersonal form, possibly using passive voice or suggestions.\n\nAnother observation: the outputs often start with \"It is...\", which might be part of the instruction. For example, the first output starts with \"It is my opinion...\", the third with \"It is suggested...\", and the second with \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". However, the second output doesn't start with \"It is...\", but the rest do. So maybe the instruction was to start the output with \"It is...\", but that doesn't fit all examples. Alternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase the input into a similar structure, but not necessarily starting with \"It is...\".\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert each input into a more formal version, using \"It is my opinion\" for statements of belief, \"I find it hard\" for inability to discern differences, \"It is suggested\" for recommendations, replacing slang with more formal adjectives, and changing \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate\".\n\nGiven that all examples follow<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the input had \"I met\" followed by \"yesterday\". The output changed \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". Wait, but in the output, it's \"whom I met yesterday\", so the structure is slightly different. The original had \"I met yesterday\" as part of the clause, but the output uses \"whom I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\"? But wait, the original input didn't have \"yesterday\" attached to \"met\"—it was \"I met yesterday\". The output has \"whom I met yesterday\". So perhaps the instruction is to insert \"whom\" before the subject? Or maybe change \"I met\" to \"whom I met\"?\n\nWait, let's look at the first example more closely. Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". So the instruction might be to add \"whom\" before the subject? But in this case, the subject is \"I met\", which is actually a verb phrase. Wait, no—the subject here is \"the lawyer\", and the clause is \"I met the lawyer yesterday\". So the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\"? But why would that be the case? Maybe it's about turning the sentence into a relative clause using \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. Let's check other examples to see if this holds.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nHmm, this seems like a rephrasing of the question into a more formal or different structure. The original is a question asking if the speaker should go with someone, and the output is a suggestion using \"shall I accompany\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into statements using different phrasing, like changing \"want me to...\" to \"accompany you\".\n\nThird input: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nSo the output is a more elaborate version of the adjective. \"Fire\" is slang for great, so the output replaces it with a synonym. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal adjectives with their more formal equivalents.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nAgain, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words with their more formal or precise synonyms.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nHere, the output is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase expressions into more formal language, replacing contractions and using more complex structures.\n\nNow, looking back at the first example, the output adds \"whom\" before \"I met\". So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. But why would that be the case? Let's think about possible instructions that could lead to these outputs.\n\nPossible instruction ideas:\n\n1. Convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject.\n2. Rephrase the sentence into a more formal structure.\n3. Replace informal expressions with their more formal counterparts.\n4. Change the sentence structure from active to passive voice.\n5. Use different pronouns or verb forms.\n\nLooking at the second example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the instruction might involve rephrasing questions into statements using different verbs (e.g., \"want\" → \"accompany\", \"do you want\" → \"shall I\").\n\nThird example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\". So replacing informal adjectives with more descriptive ones.\n\nFourth example: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Replacing common phrases with more formal terms.\n\nFifth example: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\". Changing the expression into a more formal structure.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert the sentence into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, changing verb tenses, and restructuring the sentence.\"\n\nBut let's check if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst example: Adding \"whom\" before \"I met\" makes it a relative clause. But why would that be considered formal? Maybe because using \"whom\" is more formal than \"I met\". Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to turn the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. That could explain the first example.\n\nSecond example: Changing \"Do you want me to...\" to \"Shall I...\" is a formality change. \"Shall\" is more formal than \"do you want\".\n\nThird example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" is replacing slang with a more formal adjective.\n\nFourth example: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" are replacements with more formal terms.\n\nFifth example: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" is a more formal rephrasing.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rephrase the sentence into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, changing verb tenses, and restructuring the sentence.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. But the first example does that, but the other examples don't. For instance, the second example doesn't involve adding \"whom\". So that might not be the general rule.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the first example, the output is a relative clause. The original is a statement, and the output is a relative clause. So maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. But why would that be the case? Let's see if other examples fit this pattern.\n\nSecond example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" No addition of \"whom\" here. So that doesn't fit. Third example: \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\" No addition of \"whom\". Fourth example: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Again, no \"whom\". Fifth example: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Still no \"whom\". So the first example is unique in that sense. Therefore, the instruction isn't universally adding \"whom\" everywhere.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is more general: \"Make the sentence more formal by replacing informal expressions, changing verb tenses, and restructuring the sentence.\" That would cover all examples except the first one. Wait, the first example's output is a relative clause, which is a form of restructuring. So maybe the instruction is to restructure the sentence into a more formal version, possibly using relative clauses when appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. But then why does the second example not follow that? Unless there's another pattern.\n\nWait, let's look at the second example again. The input is a question, and the output is a statement. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into statements using different phrasing. For example, changing \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\". That could be part of the instruction.\n\nThird example: replacing slang with more formal adjectives.\n\nFourth example: replacing common phrases with more formal terms.\n\nFifth example: rephrasing the expression into a more formal structure.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more formal version by making several changes: replacing contractions, changing verb tenses, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, and restructuring the sentence where necessary.\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is something like: \"Rewrite the sentence in a more formal style by replacing informal expressions, adjusting verb tenses, and restructuring as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the sentence into a relative clause by adding \"whom\" before the subject. But that only applies to the first example. However, the other examples don't fit that. So that can't be the general rule.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs and see what they have in common. All outputs seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. The first example adds a relative clause, the second rephrases a question into a statement, the third replaces slang with a more descriptive adjective, the fourth replaces common phrases with more formal terms, and the fifth rephrases an expression into a more formal structure.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Convert the sentence into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions, changing verb tenses, and restructuring the<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So here, the phrase \"once you get there\" was replaced with \"upon your arrival\". That seems like a synonym substitution. Let me check the other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the structure changed from a question using \"want\" to a more formal \"shall I...\" and the verb \"go with\" became \"accompany\". So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing questions into more formal or polite versions, possibly changing the verb tense or structure.\n\nThird input: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a complete sentence transformation. The original is a simple thanks, and the output is a longer expression of gratitude. So perhaps the instruction is to convert expressions of thanks into more elaborate phrases, maybe using synonyms or different structures.\n\nFourth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"I met\" was changed to \"whom I met\", introducing a relative pronoun. So replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" might be part of the instruction. But why would that be? Maybe the instruction is to convert direct objects into relative clauses using \"whom\"?\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" was replaced with \"entire\", and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". So it's a synonym replacement, but more precise terms. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their more formal or accurate synonyms.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what could the original instruction be? Let's think about possible instructions that could cover all these cases.\n\nLooking at the first four examples, they seem to involve rephrasing in some way. The first three examples (call, question, thanks) might be about making the language more formal or polite. The fourth example changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\", which is a more formal relative clause. The fifth example is synonym replacement.\n\nWait, but the fourth example's transformation is changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". That's a specific grammatical change. So maybe the instruction is to convert certain phrases into more formal or traditional English, like using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" when appropriate. But why only in that case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using synonyms where possible, changing sentence structures, etc. Let's see:\n\n- For the first input, \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\": replacing the adverbial phrase with a prepositional phrase.\n- Second input: changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I...\", and \"go with\" to \"accompany\".\n- Third input: converting \"thanks\" into a longer phrase.\n- Fourth input: changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\".\n- Fifth input: replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or traditional English version, possibly using synonyms, changing sentence structures, or replacing certain words with more formal alternatives. However, the fourth example specifically uses \"whom\" which is less commonly used now, so maybe the instruction is to make the language more archaic or formal.\n\nBut wait, the fourth example's output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the original had \"I met\", and the output has \"whom I met\". That's a change from active voice to passive? Or maybe it's a matter of using a relative clause with \"whom\" instead of \"who\". But why would that be part of the instruction? Unless the instruction is to convert direct objects into relative clauses using \"whom\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more formal by replacing contractions or informal phrasing. For example, \"once you get there\" is informal, so replacing it with a more formal equivalent.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or elevated in tone compared to the inputs. For example, \"upon your arrival\" is more formal than \"once you get there\". Similarly, \"accompany\" is more formal than \"go with\". \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" is a more elaborate way of saying \"Thanks\". \"Entire\" vs \"whole\", \"fabricated\" vs \"made up\".\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or elevated version of the original sentence, using synonyms, changing sentence structures, or replacing words with more formal alternatives.\n\nBut then why does the fourth example specifically use \"whom\"? That's a bit odd unless the instruction was to use older grammar rules, like using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" in certain contexts. But in modern English, \"whom\" is rarely used except in very formal or traditional contexts. So maybe the instruction was to apply such old-fashioned grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more poetic or literary style, hence using more formal language elements.\n\nPutting this all together, the most likely instruction is something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or elevated version, using synonyms, changing sentence structures, and applying traditional grammar rules where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let's check if that fits all examples:\n\n1. \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Upon your arrival, please call.\" (formal)\n2. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" (more formal)\n3. \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" (more elaborate)\n4. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" (using \"whom\" for formality)\n5. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" (synonym replacement)\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or elevated version, possibly using synonyms, changing sentence structures, and applying traditional grammar rules like using \"whom\" instead of \"who\" in certain contexts.\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be to translate the input into a more polite or formal register, which would explain the changes in the first three examples. The fourth example's use of \"whom\" suggests a more formal tone, and the fifth example's synonym replacement also fits a more formal style.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structures, and adhering to traditional grammar rules where applicable.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or elevated version**, incorporating the following key transformations:\n\n1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace informal or less precise words/phrases with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n2. **Polite/Polished Language**: Convert casual expressions into more formal or polite phrasing (e.g., \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\").\n3. **Grammatical Adjustments**: Use traditional grammar rules (e.g., replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" for formality).\n4. **Elaboration**: Expand concise expressions into more detailed or elegant statements (e.g., \"Thanks for your help.\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated\").\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structures, and adhering to traditional grammar rules where applicable.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\"\nOutput: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nSo here, the original statement is a colloquial expression (\"fire\" meaning great), and the output uses a more formal adjective \"incredibly good.\" Maybe the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more standard phrasing?\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nHmm, \"can't stand\" is a common phrase, but the output replaces it with \"cannot tolerate.\" So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain informal verb phrases with their more formal equivalents? But wait, \"tolerate\" isn't exactly the same as \"can't stand,\" but maybe in some contexts they're similar. Or maybe it's about rephrasing using different vocabulary.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nWait, here the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" So the original uses the subject case \"I met,\" but the output uses \"whom\" as the object of the preposition. That suggests changing the pronoun from subject case to object case when it follows a preposition. Because in English, after prepositions like \"with,\" \"by,\" etc., we use the objective case. So maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" when it comes after a preposition?\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\nThis seems like a complete rephrasing. The original is a negative statement about not doing something, and the output is a suggestion phrased positively. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations?\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, the output turns the first-person statement into a more formal \"it is my opinion...\" structure. So perhaps the instruction is to convert personal opinions into formal statements using \"it is my opinion that...\" or similar phrasing.\n\nNow, looking at all these transformations, there's a mix of different types of changes. Let's categorize them:\n\n1. Formalizing informal expressions (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n2. Replacing informal verb phrases with more formal ones (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n3. Changing pronoun cases after prepositions (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n4. Rephrasing negative statements into positive suggestions (e.g., \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"suggested no action\").\n5. Converting first-person opinions into formal statements (e.g., \"I think\" → \"it is my opinion\").\n\nBut the instruction is likely a single rule or set of rules that applies to all inputs. Wait, but the fifth example seems to fit a specific transformation, while others might be part of a larger pattern. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal, written style, which would explain several of these changes. For instance:\n\n- Using more formal adjectives instead of slang (\"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n- Replacing contractions with full forms (\"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n- Changing pronoun cases after prepositions (\"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n- Rephrasing negative statements into positive recommendations (\"don't think\" → \"suggested no action\").\n- Converting first-person opinions into formal statements (\"I think\" → \"it is my opinion\").\n\nIf the instruction is to rewrite the input in a more formal, written style, then all these outputs align with that. Let's check each input against this hypothesis.\n\nFirst input: \"This song is fire.\" Formalizing slang → \"incredibly good.\" Makes sense.\n\nSecond: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Formalizing \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\" Also fits.\n\nThird: \"I met\" → \"whom I met.\" Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" after preposition. Correct.\n\nFourth: Negative statement turned into a suggestion. Yes, \"don't think it's a good idea\" becomes \"suggested no action.\"\n\nFifth: \"I think\" → \"it is my opinion.\" Exactly matches the output.\n\nSo the instruction is likely to rewrite the input in a more formal, written style, possibly following certain grammatical rules like changing pronouns after prepositions, replacing contractions, converting slang, and rephrasing negative statements into positive recommendations or formal opinions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is specifically to convert first-person statements into third-person or formal statements, but the fifth example does that, and others don't. However, the other examples also fit into formalization.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some have added clauses or phrases. For example, the fourth output adds \"it is suggested that\" and \"should be taken,\" which is a way to rephrase the original negative statement into a recommendation. Similarly, the fifth example adds \"my opinion that.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite, or professional tone, possibly by adding such phrases, changing pronouns, and using more formal vocabulary.\n\nTherefore, the instruction given to the friend was likely something like: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal, written style, using appropriate grammar, replacing contractions with full forms, adjusting pronoun cases after prepositions, converting slang terms to their standard equivalents, and rephrasing negative statements into positive recommendations or formal opinions.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, written style**, adhering to the following key transformations:\n\n1. **Formalize Informal Expressions**: Convert slang or colloquialisms (e.g., \"fire\") to standard adjectives (e.g., \"incredibly good\").\n2. **Replace Contractions**: Change contractions like \"can't\" to \"cannot\" (e.g., \"I can't stand\" → \"I cannot tolerate\").\n3. **Adjust Pronouns After Prepositions**: Replace \"I\" with \"whom\" when it follows a preposition (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n4. **Rephrase Negative Statements**: Transform negative opinions into positive recommendations or formal suggestions (e.g., \"don’t think it’s a good idea\" → \"no action should be taken\").\n5. **Convert First-Person Opinions**: Rewrite \"I think\" as \"it is my opinion\" to adopt a more formal tone.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe instruction was to **rewrite each input in a more formal, written style**, incorporating adjustments for grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing as outlined above.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the pairs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n2. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n3. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n4. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n5. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nLooking at these, each output seems to be a rephrasing or restructuring of the input sentence. Let's break down each pair:\n\n1. The first input is a question asking ability. The output is a more formal rephrasing using \"be able to\" and changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\". So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements with a more polite or formal tone, perhaps using \"be able to\" instead of \"can\".\n\n2. The second input is a sentence with a relative clause. The output replaces \"I met\" with \"whom I met\", indicating a change from a non-restrictive relative clause to a restrictive one. Wait, but the original uses \"I met yesterday\" as part of the relative clause. The output uses \"whom I met yesterday\", which might be a way to make the clause more direct or perhaps to emphasize the subject. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I met\" with \"whom I met\" to make it more formal or to use a different relative pronoun.\n\n3. The third input is a first-person statement expressing an opinion. The output changes \"I think that\" to \"It is my opinion that\". This seems like converting a personal opinion into a more formal or indirect statement. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase opinions into a more formal structure, using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\".\n\n4. The fourth input is a statement expressing difficulty in distinguishing two things. The output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\". So here, the instruction might involve replacing certain phrases with more formal alternatives, like using \"find it hard to\" instead of \"can't tell\".\n\n5. The fifth input is a casual greeting. The output is a more formal response, changing \"See you\" to \"I look forward to meeting you\". So perhaps the instruction was to convert informal greetings into more formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Each output seems to be a more formal or polite version of the input. For example:\n\n- Question about ability becomes a more formal request.\n- Casual relative clause becomes a more direct one (using \"whom\").\n- Personal opinion becomes a more formal statement of opinion.\n- Difficulty in distinguishing becomes a more formal expression of uncertainty.\n- Informal greeting becomes a formal expression of looking forward.\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. But let's check if there's another possible angle. Maybe the instruction was to convert certain types of sentences into others. For instance, questions into statements, or first-person into third-person, etc. But in the first example, the input is a question, and the output is a statement. The second example is a sentence with a relative clause, output is similar but with \"whom\". Third is first-person to third-person (\"It is my opinion...\"). Fourth is a statement to another statement. Fifth is a greeting to a response.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to transform each input into a more formal or indirect version. For example, using \"be able to\" instead of \"can\", replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\", using \"whom\" instead of \"I met\", etc. All these outputs seem to follow a pattern of formality and politeness.\n\nAnother possibility is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct statement. For example, the first input is a direct question, output is a more indirect phrasing. The second input uses \"I met\" which is direct, output uses \"whom I met\" which might be seen as more direct. Wait, but \"whom I met\" is still direct; maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain pronouns or verb forms.\n\nWait, let's look at the second input again: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the only change is replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\". That could be part of making the sentence more formal, perhaps using the objective case after \"lawyer\" because it's the subject of the relative clause. Wait, no—the relative clause here is \"whom I met yesterday\"—the subject of the relative clause is \"lawyer\", so \"whom\" is the object of \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to use the correct relative pronoun, changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" to properly refer to the lawyer as the object of the verb \"met\".\n\nSimilarly, in the third input: \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\". This is a common way to rephrase opinions to sound more formal or professional.\n\nIn the fourth input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". Again, replacing a negative phrase with a more formal alternative.\n\nThe fifth input: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Changing a casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely required the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. The key elements would be:\n\n- Converting questions into statements with a more formal tone (like using \"be able to\" instead of \"can\").\n- Using more formal relative clauses (e.g., replacing \"I met\" with \"whom I met\").\n- Replacing first-person expressions of opinion with \"it is my opinion\".\n- Using more formal alternatives for expressions of difficulty (e.g., \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\").\n- Converting informal greetings into more formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language transformations such as replacing contractions, adjusting relative pronouns, rephrasing opinions, and converting informal greetings into more formal expressions.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, applying specific linguistic transformations. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Formalize Questions**: Convert questions about ability into polite requests using \"be able to\" and restructuring.  \n   *Example*: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"*\n\n2. **Refine Relative Clauses**: Use \"whom\" to clarify the grammatical role in restrictive relative clauses.  \n   *Example*: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (to avoid ambiguity).*\n\n3. **Polish Opinions**: Replace \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\" for a more formal tone.  \n   *Example*: \"I think...\" → \"It is my opinion...\".*\n\n4. **Elevate Uncertainty**: Substitute casual expressions of difficulty with more formal alternatives.  \n   *Example*: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\".*\n\n5. **Greet Formally**: Transform informal greetings into polite anticipatory statements.  \n   *Example*: \"See you...\" → \"I look forward to meeting you...\".*\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, adjusting relative pronouns, rephrasing opinions, and converting informal expressions into more refined alternatives.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let's start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHmm, so the output seems to rephrase the input. The original uses \"considered many,\" and the output changes it to \"various approaches were considered.\" Wait, the structure here is slightly different. The original is in present tense (\"considered\"), while the output is past tense? Wait, no—the original is \"I considered\" (past tense), and the output is \"were considered\" (passive voice). So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into passive voice? But let's check other examples to see if that holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nOriginal is a greeting, output is a more formal response. So here, the instruction might be to rephrase greetings into more polite or formal versions. But wait, the first example was about changing active to passive. These seem conflicting. Maybe the instruction isn't a single rule but multiple possibilities. But the user says the friend read the instruction once and applied it to all inputs. So likely a single consistent rule.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nSo \"can't stand\" is rephrased as \"cannot tolerate.\" Both are negative expressions, but the exact phrasing changes. So maybe replacing certain collocations with synonyms or related phrases.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\nHere, the informal slang \"fire\" is replaced with a more standard expression \"incredibly good.\" So perhaps the instruction was to translate informal slang into more formal or standard language.\n\nFifth input:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nOriginal is a question asking if the speaker should go along, output is a more formal or traditional phrasing using \"shall\" and \"accompany.\"\n\nNow, trying to find a common thread. Let's list possible transformations:\n\n1. Passive voice conversion (first pair).\n2. Formalizing greetings (second pair).\n3. Replacing collocations (third pair).\n4. Converting slang to standard terms (fourth pair).\n5. Changing question structure from \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\" (fifth pair).\n\nBut how can these all be covered by a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check:\n\n- First input: \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered.\" The original is in past tense, passive voice. The output is also past tense passive. So maybe converting active to passive voice. But why does the second input become a greeting? That doesn't fit. Unless the instruction was to rephrase in a more formal tone, which could include both passive voice and greetings.\n\nWait, the second input-output pair is a greeting turned into a more formal response. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see:\n\n- \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common way to respond to a casual greeting with a more formal one. Similarly, \"Shall I accompany you?\" is a formal way to ask if you should go along.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check the other examples under this lens:\n\nFirst input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" This could be seen as a more formal restatement, perhaps using \"various\" instead of \"many\" and restructuring the sentence to passive voice. But why passive? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase in a more formal tone, which sometimes involves passive voice.\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Here, \"can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\nFourth input: Slang \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" which is a more standard expression.\n\nFifth input: The question is rephrased into a formal request using \"shall\" and \"accompany.\"\n\nSo if the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, then all these outputs make sense. However, the first example's passive voice might not directly relate to formality. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert active voice to passive where possible, but that doesn't explain the second example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate informal expressions into more formal ones. For example, \"fire\" to \"incredibly good,\" \"can't stand\" to \"cannot tolerate,\" etc. The first example's passive voice might be part of making it more formal. The second example is a greeting converted into a more formal response. The third example is replacing a colloquial phrase with a more formal one. The fourth is slang to standard. The fifth is changing the question structure to a more formal phrasing.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used. The first output uses \"were considered\" (passive), the second uses \"look forward to\" (a formal expression), third uses \"cannot tolerate\" (formal), fourth uses \"is incredibly good\" (standard), fifth uses \"shall I accompany\" (formal). So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly involving passive voice in some cases.\n\nBut why does the first example use passive voice? Maybe because the original is in past tense, and the instruction required passive voice regardless of the original structure. But the second example is a greeting converted into a formal response, which doesn't involve passive voice. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the input into a more formal version, which might involve various transformations like changing contractions, using more formal vocabulary, restructuring sentences, etc. All the examples seem to fit under this umbrella.\n\nLet me check if there's another possible instruction. For instance, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words or phrases. For example:\n\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\"\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"\n- \"see you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"\n- \"do you want me to go with you\" → \"shall I accompany you\"\n\nBut this approach would require knowing which words/phrases to replace, which might vary per input. However, the user says the friend read the instruction once and applied it to all inputs, implying a general rule rather than specific replacements.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version by using more complex sentence structures, avoiding contractions, etc. For example:\n\n- \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, \"many\" becomes \"various,\" and the sentence is made passive. The original is in past tense, and the output is also past tense. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase in a more formal style, possibly using passive voice when appropriate.\n\nBut why does the second input become a greeting response? That doesn't fit passive voice. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, which could involve various transformations depending on the context. For example:\n\n- Greetings: Convert to more formal responses.\n- Expressions like \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\"\n- Slang terms → standard terms.\n- Questions → formal requests.\n\nSo the instruction might have been something like: \"Rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, adjusting verb tenses, sentence structure, and vocabulary accordingly.\"\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\n1. Input: Active voice, past tense. Output: Passive voice, past tense. So maybe converting active to passive.\n2. Input: Greeting. Output: Formal response.\n3. Input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate.\"\n4. Input: Slang \"fire\" → \"incredibly good.\"\n5. Input: Question → formal request.\n\nIf the instruction was to convert active to passive voice, then the first example fits. But the second example doesn't. So that can't be the only rule.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the input into a more formal version, which might involve passive voice in some cases, but not others. For example, the first example uses passive voice, the second uses a formal greeting, the third uses a more formal verb, the fourth replaces slang with standard, and the fifth changes the question structure.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used in the outputs:\n\n- \"were considered\" (passive)\n- \"look forward to\" (formal)\n- \"cannot tolerate\" (formal)\n- \"is incredibly good\" (neutral)\n- \"shall I accompany\" (formal)\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, which could involve various transformations like passive voice, replacing informal verbs with formal ones, changing question structures, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to translate the input into a more polite or formal version, which might involve different strategies depending on the input type. For example:\n\n- For greetings: Respond with a formal acknowledgment.\n- For expressions of inability: Use \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand.\"\n- For slang: Replace with standard terms.\n- For questions: Restructure into<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, looking at each pair, there seems to be a pattern where the output is a rephrased version of the input, but with some specific changes. Let me go through each example one by one.\n\nFirst input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So here, \"whole\" became \"entire,\" and \"made up\" became \"fabricated.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with synonyms? But wait, \"whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, but \"made up\" and \"fabricated\" are also synonyms. But maybe there's more to it. Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival.\" So \"once\" is replaced with \"upon,\" and \"get there\" becomes \"your arrival.\" That seems like replacing the phrase with a more formal synonym. Similarly, \"call once\" becomes \"call upon.\"\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" So \"got what you said\" is rephrased as \"understood you.\" The verb \"got\" is changed to \"understood,\" and the structure shifts from \"what you said\" to \"you.\" Maybe the instruction involves changing verbs to their synonyms and restructuring the sentence?\n\nFourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the first person perspective (\"I think\") is converted into a third person (\"It is my opinion\"), and the structure is slightly altered. So perhaps the instruction is to convert first-person statements into third-person opinions?\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\" The original uses \"can't tell the difference,\" which is rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish.\" So \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard,\" and the structure changes from \"difference between\" to \"distinguish between.\"\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might involve several transformations. Let's see if there's a common thread. For the first example, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Second example, replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\" Third, changing \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\" Fourth, converting \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\" Fifth, changing \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic tone. Let's check each transformation:\n\n1. \"whole\" → \"entire\" (synonym), \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (synonym). So replacing common phrases with more formal terms.\n2. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival.\" \"Once\" is replaced with \"upon,\" and \"get there\" becomes \"arrival.\" This seems like using a more formal prepositional phrase.\n3. \"got what you said\" → \"understood you.\" \"Got\" is a colloquial term; \"understood\" is more formal. Also, the structure shifts from \"what you said\" to \"you.\"\n4. \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion.\" Changing first-person to third-person, and phrasing as an opinion rather than a personal belief.\n5. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" \"Can't tell\" is informal; \"find it hard\" is more formal. The structure changes from \"difference between\" to \"distinguish between.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic style, using synonyms and restructuring sentences. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nFor the first input, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" (formal) and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\" (formal synonym). The second example uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there,\" which is more formal. Third example replaces \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is more formal. Fourth example converts first-person to third-person and rephrases as an opinion. Fifth example uses \"find it hard\" instead of \"can't tell,\" which is more formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely tells the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or academic version, possibly by replacing certain words with synonyms, restructuring sentences, and using more formal phrasing. The key elements would be to use more formal vocabulary, avoid contractions or colloquialisms, and adjust sentence structures for clarity and formality.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or academic tone**, utilizing synonyms, restructuring sentences, and avoiding colloquialisms. Below is the synthesized instruction based on the observed patterns:\n\n---\n\n**Instruction:**  \nRedesign each input by transforming it into a more formal or academic version. Replace informal expressions with their synonyms, adjust sentence structures for clarity, and eliminate contractions or colloquial phrasing. Focus on enhancing precision and formality while preserving the original meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Example Breakdown:**  \n1. **Input:** \"The whole story was made up.\"  \n   **Output:** \"The entire story was fabricated.\"  \n   - *Replacement:* \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated.\"  \n\n2. **Input:** \"Please call once you get there.\"  \n   **Output:** \"Please call upon your arrival.\"  \n   - *Replacement:* \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival.\"  \n\n3. **Input:** \"I got what you said.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I understood you.\"  \n   - *Replacement:* \"got\" → \"understood,\" restructuring from \"what you said\" to \"you.\"  \n\n4. **Input:** \"I think that this is interesting.\"  \n   **Output:** \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"  \n   - *Transformation:* Convert first-person (\"I think\") to third-person (\"It is my opinion\").  \n\n5. **Input:** \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"  \n   **Output:** \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"  \n   - *Replacement:* \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard,\" restructuring \"difference between\" to \"distinguish between.\"  \n\n---\n\nThis systematic approach ensures outputs align with formal language conventions, enhancing clarity and sophistication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to reverse-engineer the rule or transformation applied here. Let me start by looking at each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, let's list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nLooking at these, I notice that some of the outputs seem to rephrase the input in a slightly different way. Let's break down each one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nOriginal: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\nSo, the input is a direct expression of gratitude. The output is a more formal or polite way of expressing the same idea. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect expression of thanks? But wait, the second input is a question asking if someone can do tasks, and the output is phrased as a possibility (\"Would you...\"), which might be a way to soften the request. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or indirect form, especially when it's a request or a statement.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the input is a concise statement of understanding, and the output is a more direct rephrasing. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more direct or explicit statement of comprehension.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" This seems like a synonym substitution. \"Looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which are synonyms. So perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms to make the sentence more varied.\n\nFifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, the input uses \"once you get there,\" and the output uses \"upon your arrival.\" Both mean the same thing but use different prepositions. So maybe the instruction involves replacing certain phrases with their equivalents or rephrasing using synonyms.\n\nNow, looking across all examples, there's a mix of different transformations. Some are about rephrasing into a more formal tone (like the first example), others involve changing the structure of questions (second input becomes a possibility), some are synonym substitutions (fourth), and others are phrase replacements (fifth). The third example is a direct rephrasing without any obvious change.\n\nWait, but the third input is \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" So here, the subject and verb are changed. The original is \"got what you said\" (past tense, passive?) and the output is \"understood you\" (active voice, present tense). So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more active voice or adjust the tense?\n\nBut then the first example changes \"your help\" to \"Your assistance,\" which is more formal. The second example turns \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\" which is a softer way of asking. The fourth example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\" The fifth example replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nHmm. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms where possible, adjusting sentence structure, and replacing certain phrases with their equivalents. But how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or indirect form, especially when making requests or statements. For example, turning direct questions into softer ones, or expressing gratitude in a more formal way. But the third example doesn't fit that pattern—it's a direct statement becoming another direct statement. Similarly, the fourth example is a synonym substitution, which isn't directly related to politeness.\n\nWait, but the fourth example is replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" which are synonyms. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain common phrases with their synonyms to vary the vocabulary. However, the first example is about rephrasing gratitude into a more formal version, the second is about rephrasing a question into a possibility, the third is a direct rephrasing, the fourth is synonym substitution, and the fifth is replacing a phrase with its equivalent.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might have multiple parts. For example, sometimes rephrase into a more formal tone, sometimes replace phrases with synonyms, sometimes adjust sentence structure, etc. But how to combine these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms where possible, and adjusting sentence structure. But the examples show different types of transformations. Let's see:\n\n1. Gratitude → Formal expression of thanks.\n2. Direct question → Softened into a possibility.\n3. Concise statement → More direct rephrasing.\n4. Synonym substitution.\n5. Phrase replacement.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, possibly using synonyms or rephrasing phrases. But how to capture all these in a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or indirect form, especially when making requests or statements. For example, turning direct questions into softer ones, expressing gratitude in a more formal way, and replacing certain phrases with their equivalents. But the third example doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nWait, the third example is \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" So here, the input is a past tense statement, and the output is a present tense statement. Maybe the instruction was to adjust the tense or voice? But the first example changes \"your help\" to \"Your assistance,\" which is a capitalization and noun vs. verb phrase. The second example changes \"can you\" to \"would you be able to,\" which is a modal verb change and addition of \"be able to.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using more polite language. For example, changing \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way of saying the same thing. Similarly, \"Can you do...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is a softer way of asking. \"Your help\" is rephrased as \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which adds more detail.\n\nBut the fourth example is just a synonym substitution. So perhaps the instruction had multiple components: sometimes rephrasing into a more formal tone, sometimes replacing phrases with synonyms, sometimes adjusting sentence structure, etc. But how to combine these into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms where possible, and adjusting sentence structure. But the examples show different types of transformations. Let's look for a common thread.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs that aren't immediately obvious. For example, the first output ends with \"is much appreciated,\" which adds emphasis. The second output adds \"be able to.\" The third output changes \"got\" to \"understood\" (different verb). The fourth changes \"looks like\" to \"resembles.\" The fifth changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction involved several steps: for each input, check if it's a question, and if so, rephrase it into a softer form; if it's a statement of gratitude, rephrase it into a more formal version; if it's a comparison, replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\"; if it's a request, rephrase it into a more formal version; and so on. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, using synonyms where possible, and adjusting sentence structure. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, changing tenses, adding more polite language, etc. But how to generalize this?\n\nWait, looking at the outputs:\n\n1. Original: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So the input is a direct expression of gratitude, and the output is a more formal, longer version. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase expressions of gratitude into a more formal or indirect form.\n\n2. Original: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the input is a direct question, and the output is a softer version, using \"would\" instead of \"can\" and adding \"be able to.\"\n\n3. Original: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\" This is a direct rephrasing, changing \"got\" to \"understood\" and adjusting the sentence structure from \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you.\"\n\n4. Original: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Synonym substitution.\n\n5. Original: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Phrase replacement, changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nSo, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, possibly using synonyms or re<|end_of_thought|>phrasing phrases. However, the third example doesn't fit the \"formal\" part, but it's a direct rephrasing. The fourth"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nSo here, the output seems to rephrase the input. The key change is replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both phrases mean the same thing but use different verbs. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or slightly different wording using synonyms or restructuring.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nAgain, similar structure but using \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" and \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up.\" So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nHere, the question is transformed from a simple \"can you\" to a more polite \"would you be able to...\" and the verb changes from \"do\" to \"accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing questions into more formal or indirect requests, possibly changing verbs and adding phrases like \"be able to.\"\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"Please call once you get there.\"\nOutput: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nThe output uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" So replacing temporal expressions with more formal alternatives. Maybe the instruction is to convert informal time expressions into more formal ones, using prepositional phrases or specific collocations.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\nOutput: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nThis one is more substantial. The input is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a suggestion phrased as a recommendation. The structure here is completely different. The input is a first-person opinion, while the output is a third-person suggestion using \"it is suggested\" and \"should be taken.\" So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase statements expressing reluctance or lack of ideas into positive suggestions or recommendations, possibly using modal verbs like \"should\" and restructuring the sentence.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction might be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms, restructuring sentences, and converting negative statements into positive suggestions where appropriate.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if that fits all cases. For example, the third input is a question, which becomes a more polite request. The fourth is a temporal expression replaced with a formal one. The fifth is a complete restructuring of the sentence into a suggestion. The first two are synonym replacements. So maybe the overall instruction is to transform the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly rephrasing, replacing words with synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and converting negative statements into positive recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to make the output more formal by replacing contractions, using more precise vocabulary, and restructuring sentences. Let's see:\n\n- First input: \"can't tell\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\" – replacing contraction with full phrase, using \"distinguish\" instead of \"tell the difference.\"\n- Second: \"whole\" → \"entire,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" – replacing with synonyms.\n- Third: \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" – making it a more polite request, changing \"do\" to \"accomplish.\"\n- Fourth: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" – replacing informal expression with formal one.\n- Fifth: Entirely rephrasing the statement into a suggestion using \"it is suggested\" and \"should be taken.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms, restructuring sentences, and converting negative statements into positive recommendations when necessary.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth example isn't just a recommendation; it's a complete rephrasing. So maybe the instruction is broader: take the input and rephrase it in a way that's more formal, polite, or structured differently, possibly turning negative statements into positive suggestions.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more formal language (e.g., \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"), more polite phrasing (\"Would you be able to\" instead of \"Can you\"), and more formal connectors (\"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there\"). The fifth example transforms a negative statement into a suggestion using \"it is suggested\" and \"should be taken.\"\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Convert each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version by replacing informal terms with synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and rephrasing negative statements into positive recommendations.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms, adjusting verb tenses, and restructuring sentences. But the fifth example also includes changing the subject from first person (\"We don't think\") to third person (\"It is suggested\"), which is a significant structural change.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, using appropriate vocabulary, adjusting sentence structure, and converting subjective opinions into objective suggestions where possible.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" – replaces \"can't\" with \"find it hard,\" uses \"distinguish\" instead of \"difference,\" more formal.\n2. Input: \"The whole story...\" → Output: \"The entire story...\" – replaces \"whole\" with \"entire,\" more formal.\n3. Input: \"Can you...\" → Output: \"Would you be able to...\" – makes it more polite, adds \"be able to.\"\n4. Input: \"Please call once...\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival...\" – replaces informal \"once\" with formal \"upon your arrival.\"\n5. Input: \"We don't think...\" → Output: \"It is suggested...\" – converts first-person opinion into a third-person suggestion, uses \"suggested\" and \"should be taken.\"\n\nYes, this seems to fit. The instruction likely requires rephrasing the input into a more formal, polite, or structured version, possibly using synonyms, adjusting sentence parts, and converting negative statements into positive recommendations when applicable.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal terms with synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and converting negative statements into positive recommendations where possible.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, utilizing synonyms, restructuring sentences, and converting negative statements into positive recommendations when appropriate.

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"This song is fire.\" Output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" So the original phrase uses slang (\"fire\") which is replaced with a more formal synonym. \"Fire\" here means something is great or awesome, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\" makes sense. Maybe the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more standard phrasing.\n\nSecond input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" Output is \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is rephrased using \"would\" instead of \"can,\" and \"accomplish\" replaces \"do.\" So maybe the instruction involves restructuring questions by changing the verb form and replacing certain words with synonyms or more formal terms.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" The original is a colloquial way of saying they understood. The output uses \"understood\" directly, but the subject and object are swapped. Wait, no—the original is \"I got what you said,\" which is \"I understood your statement.\" The output is \"I understood you,\" which changes the object to the subject. That seems like a different transformation. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal tone, but how does swapping subject and object fit in? Or perhaps it's about converting reported speech or indirect statements into direct ones? Not sure yet.\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" So \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles.\" Both mean similar, but \"resembles\" is more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal counterparts.\n\nFifth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So the instruction might involve transforming casual phrases into polite, formal responses.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. Let's list possible transformations:\n\n1. Converting informal expressions to formal ones (e.g., \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\", \"look like\" → \"resemble\").\n2. Restructuring questions (e.g., changing \"can you...\" to \"would you be able to...\").\n3. Changing the subject-verb structure (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n4. Replacing certain verbs with synonyms (e.g., \"look forward to\" vs. \"look forward to meeting you\").\n\nWait, the third example's output is \"I understood you\" instead of \"I understood what you said.\" That's a bit confusing. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal way, possibly removing contractions or changing the sentence structure. For instance, \"I got what you said\" could be transformed into \"I understood your statement,\" but the output is \"I understood you,\" which is different. Alternatively, maybe it's about converting reported speech into direct speech? Like changing \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which might be a way of reporting the understanding without explicitly stating the content. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or formal response. For example, the first input is converted to a more positive statement. The second input becomes a more formal question. The fourth input is a neutral statement turned into a formal one. The fifth input is a casual greeting turned into a formal anticipation. The third input's output is a bit unclear, but perhaps it's about rephrasing the sentence to focus on the speaker's understanding rather than the content.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many use \"I\" as the subject, which wasn't present in some inputs. For example, the first input starts with \"This song,\" but the output starts with \"I.\" So maybe the instruction requires adding \"I\" as the subject. But not all outputs have \"I.\" For example, the second output is \"Would you be able...\" which doesn't start with \"I.\" So that can't be the case.\n\nWait, the second input's output is \"Would you be able to accomplish...\" which is a question directed at the listener. The original is also a question. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into more formal versions, possibly using \"would\" instead of \"can\" and expanding the verb.\n\nLooking at the third input: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" The original is a contraction (\"got\"), and the output is more formal. Also, the object \"what you said\" is omitted, but the output removes the \"you said\" part and just says \"understood you.\" Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more concise form, removing filler words or colloquialisms.\n\nThe fourth input is straightforward replacement of \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n\nThe fifth input transforms a casual greeting into a formal expression of looking forward to the meeting.\n\nSo putting this together, possible instruction categories:\n\n1. Convert informal expressions to formal equivalents.\n2. Restructure questions into more formal versions.\n3. Rephrase sentences to be more concise or direct.\n4. Replace certain verbs with more formal alternatives.\n5. Transform greetings into formal anticipatory statements.\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction? Let's think about the outputs again. Each output seems to be a more formal version of the input, but the exact transformation varies. For example, the first input's output is a more positive statement, the second is a rephrased question, the third is a rephrased sentence with \"I,\" the fourth is a synonym substitution, and the fifth is a greeting turned into a formal anticipation.\n\nWait, the third input's output is \"I understood you\" instead of \"I understood what you said.\" That suggests that the instruction might involve removing the object of the sentence. But why? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a way that emphasizes the speaker's understanding rather than the content. Alternatively, it could be converting the sentence into a more direct statement of understanding without specifying the content.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal, polite response, regardless of the original structure. For example:\n\n- If the input is a statement, make it more positive or formal.\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it into a more formal version.\n- If the input is a greeting, turn it into a formal anticipation.\n\nBut how to cover all cases? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: Statement → more positive.\nSecond input: Question → rephrased formally.\nThird input: Statement → rephrased with \"I.\"\nFourth input: Statement → synonym substitution.\nFifth input: Greeting → formal anticipation.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal, polite version, possibly using \"I\" where appropriate, and replacing certain phrases with more formal alternatives. But how to generalize this across all examples?\n\nAnother approach: Look for common transformations between each input and output.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput 1: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" The key change is replacing \"fire\" (slang) with \"incredibly good\" (more formal). So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nInput 2: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" The change here is replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to,\" and \"do\" with \"accomplish.\" So perhaps the instruction involves rephrasing questions by changing the modal verb and replacing the base verb with a synonym.\n\nInput 3: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" The original is a contraction (\"got\") and the output is more formal. Also, the object \"what you said\" is omitted. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence into a more concise form, removing filler words and focusing on the main idea.\n\nInput 4: \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" Direct synonym substitution.\n\nInput 5: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the input is a casual greeting, and the output is a formal expression of anticipation. So the instruction might involve transforming casual greetings into formal expressions of looking forward to the meeting.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction could be something like: \"Convert the input into a more formal, polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, rephrasing questions into more formal versions, and transforming greetings into anticipatory statements.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal, polite version, using appropriate language based on context. However, the examples show different types of transformations, so the instruction might need to cover multiple aspects.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Polish the input by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, rephrasing questions into more polite forms, and transforming greetings into anticipatory statements.\"\n\nBut let's check if this covers all examples:\n\n1. \"This song is fire.\" → Formal equivalent: \"incredibly good.\" Check.\n2. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\" Check.\n3. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Check.\n4. \"She looks like...\" → \"resembles.\" Check.\n5. \"<|end_of_thought|>\"\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **polish the input by converting informal expressions into more formal equivalents, rephrasing questions"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see what transformation or rule is applied from input to output. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\nSo here, the original sentence uses \"got\" which is informal, and the output replaces it with \"understood.\" That seems like a more formal or standard verb choice. Maybe the instruction was to convert informal expressions into more formal ones?\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I can't stand his temper.\"\nOutput: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\nAgain, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate.\" Both mean the same thing, but \"tolerate\" might be considered more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain informal phrasal verbs with their more formal equivalents.\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nHere, \"resembles\" is a synonym for \"looks like,\" but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal comparisons with more formal ones using synonyms.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nThis changes the structure entirely. The original is a negative statement (\"can't tell\"), and the output rephrases it as \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase sentences using more formal language structures, possibly avoiding negatives and using passive constructions or different verb forms.\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the input uses the possessive \"I met\" (implied by \"I met yesterday\"), while the output adds \"whom\" to make it more formal. So changing the relative pronoun from \"who\" to \"whom\" in a formal context. Wait, but \"whom\" is often used where \"who\" would be grammatically correct, but sometimes people use \"whom\" more formally. However, in this case, the original uses \"I met yesterday\" (so the relative clause is \"whom I met yesterday\"). The output adds \"whom\" explicitly. So maybe the instruction was to add \"whom\" when referring to the subject in a relative clause for formality.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves converting informal or less formal language into more formal or academic language. Each output example uses more formal vocabulary, restructures sentences to avoid contractions or negatives, and uses more formal pronouns like \"whom\" instead of \"who.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another possible angle. For example, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms, but looking at the examples:\n\nFirst input: \"got\" → \"understood\" (synonym)\nSecond: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym phrase)\nThird: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym)\nFourth: rephrasing the entire sentence structure\nFifth: changing \"who\" to \"whom\"\n\nSo combining all these transformations, the instruction could be something like: \"Replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, rephrase sentences using more formal vocabulary and structures, and use formal pronouns like 'whom' where appropriate.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to make the output more formal by using more precise vocabulary, avoiding contractions, and using more complex sentence structures. But the fifth example specifically adds \"whom,\" which is a more formal relative pronoun. So that's a key point.\n\nAnother thought: In some contexts, \"whom\" is used where \"who\" would be correct, but it's considered more formal. For example, in the sentence \"The person whom I saw,\" \"whom\" is correct because it's the object of the verb \"saw.\" Here, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" which could be rewritten as \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So adding \"whom\" makes it more formal.\n\nSo putting all this together, the instruction probably was to convert the input sentences into more formal versions by replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, restructuring sentences to use more formal vocabulary and grammar, such as avoiding contractions, using more precise verbs, and using formal pronouns like \"whom\" in appropriate relative clauses.\n\nLet me verify if there's any other pattern. For example, the fourth input-output pair changes \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way of expressing difficulty. Similarly, the third pair uses \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like.\" The second pair uses \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand.\" The first pair replaces \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n\nSo the common thread is replacing informal elements with more formal ones. Therefore, the instruction is likely: \"Rewrite each input sentence using more formal language, replacing informal expressions, contractions, and colloquialisms with their more formal equivalents, and restructuring sentences where necessary to enhance formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to your friend was to **convert informal or conversational language into more formal, academic, or precise expressions**. This involved several key transformations across the input-output pairs:\n\n1. **Replacing Informal Expressions with Formal Alternatives**:  \n   - \"got\" → \"understood\" (replacing an informal verb with a more formal one).  \n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (substituting a phrasal verb with its formal equivalent).  \n\n2. **Rephrasing Sentence Structures**:  \n   - \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" (avoiding negatives and using a more formal verb phrase).  \n\n3. **Using Formal Pronouns and Relative Clauses**:  \n   - \"I met yesterday\" → \"whom I met yesterday\" (adding \"whom\" to enhance formality in relative clauses).  \n\n4. **Synonym Substitutions for Colloquial Terms**:  \n   - \"resembles\" vs. \"looks like\" (preferring synonyms that align with formal writing).  \n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input sentence using more formal language, replacing informal expressions, contractions, and colloquialisms with their more precise, academic equivalents, and restructuring sentences where necessary to enhance formality.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user gave five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the original instruction. Let's start by analyzing each pair to see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nSo here, the output seems to rephrase the original sentence. The key change is replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\" That might be part of the instruction—maybe to rephrase the original statement into a more formal or indirect expression.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\nOutput: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nAgain, a rephrasing. The original is a question asking if the speaker should go along, and the output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal or traditional way of phrasing the same request. So perhaps the instruction is to convert questions into polite requests using certain phrasing.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\nHere, the output is a more concise version. The original is a bit informal (\"got what you said\"), and the output simplifies it to \"understood you.\" Maybe the instruction is to rephrase in a more formal tone, reducing colloquial expressions.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\nOutput: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nThis is another rephrasing. The original uses \"can't tell the difference,\" and the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both mean the same thing but use different phrasing. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"She looks like her sister.\"\nOutput: \"She resembles her sister.\"\nAgain, a synonym substitution. \"Looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles.\" So perhaps the instruction involves replacing specific words or phrases with their synonyms to make the sentence more formal or precise.\n\nNow, putting all these together, the instruction likely asks the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check each example against possible instructions.\n\nPossible instruction candidates could be something like: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or polite version.\" But let's see if that fits all cases.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion.\" That's a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a polite request. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" which is more direct. \"Can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way. \"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles,\" another synonym substitution.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction is to convert first-person statements into third-person or indirect statements. For example, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" which is a third-person construction. But not all outputs follow that. For instance, the third input is \"I got what you said,\" output is \"I understood you.\" Here, the subject remains \"I,\" but the verb changes from past tense to past tense (got vs. understood). Wait, no—the original is \"I got,\" output is \"I understood.\" So that's a change from \"got\" to \"understood,\" which is a synonym substitution rather than a grammatical change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase using more formal language, replacing contractions and colloquialisms. For example, \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion,\" which removes the contraction \"I think\" and adds \"my opinion.\" Similarly, \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal structure. \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which replaces the colloquial \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction might be to convert questions into statements or requests using specific phrasing. For example, \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a request phrased as a question. But the fourth input isn't a question, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, the fourth input is a statement: \"I can't tell the difference...\" and the output is a rephrased statement. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase any given sentence into a more formal version, regardless of the original structure.\n\nLooking at all examples, the common thread seems to be replacing certain phrases with more formal alternatives. For instance:\n\n- \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"\n- \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\"\n- \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\"\n- \"I can't tell the difference\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish\"\n- \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister\"\n\nIn each case, the output uses more formal or precise wording. So the instruction might be: \"Replace informal or colloquial expressions with more formal or precise language.\" Alternatively, \"Rephrase each sentence into a more polite or formal version.\"\n\nBut let's check if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into third-person or indirect statements. However, the first example does that, but others don't. The second example is a question to a request, which isn't a third-person conversion. The third example is a first-person statement becoming another first-person statement with a different verb. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: The instruction might be to use a specific structure, like starting with \"It is my opinion\" when the input starts with \"I think.\" But the other examples don't follow that. For example, the second input is a question, which becomes a request starting with \"Shall I...\" which is a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using more elevated vocabulary. For example, replacing \"think\" with \"opinion,\" \"want\" with \"accompany,\" \"got\" with \"understood,\" \"difference\" with \"distinguish,\" \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite style, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct form. For example, turning direct questions into requests phrased as questions (like \"Shall I accompany you?\"), but that only applies to the second input. The fourth input is a statement, not a question, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the second input is a question, and the output is a request phrased as a question. The fourth input is a statement, and the output is a statement. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase any input into a more formal version, regardless of the original type. For example, converting \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal request, and \"I can't tell the difference...\" to \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\nAnother thought: The instruction might involve replacing certain verbs or phrases with their synonyms. For example, \"think\" → \"opinion,\" \"want\" → \"accompany,\" \"tell the difference\" → \"distinguish,\" \"look like\" → \"resemble.\"\n\nIf that's the case, then the instruction could be: \"Replace the given phrases with their synonyms to make the sentence more formal or precise.\"\n\nBut how do we reconcile this with the first example where \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\"? That's not exactly a synonym substitution but a restructuring. So maybe the instruction is a combination of both: rephrasing and replacing synonyms.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Convert each sentence into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents and restructuring as needed.\"\n\nBut the problem is that the instruction needs to be concise. Let's look back at the examples again.\n\nFor the first input-output pair, the main change is replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\" This could be part of a larger instruction to rephrase the sentence into a more formal tone, possibly using third-person pronouns and more elevated language.\n\nThe second example changes \"Do you want...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way of making a request. The third example shortens \"I got what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct statement. The fourth example replaces \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal phrasing. The fifth example replaces \"looks like\" with \"resembles,\" a synonym substitution.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely tells the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain phrases with their synonyms, restructuring sentences, and using more elevated language. The key elements seem to be:\n\n1. Formalizing the language (e.g., replacing contractions, informal expressions).\n2. Using more polite or indirect phrasing (e.g., \"Shall I...\" instead of \"Do you want...\").\n3. Replacing specific words or phrases with their synonyms (e.g., \"think\" → \"opinion,\" \"difference\" → \"distinguish\").\n\nTherefore, the instruction could be something like: \"Rewrite each sentence into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents and restructuring as necessary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the instruction given to the friend.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - Let's compare the two. The original uses \"whole\" which becomes \"entire,\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" So maybe replacing certain phrases or words with synonyms or more formal terms?\n\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - Here, the question is rephrased using \"shall\" instead of \"do you want,\" and \"accompany\" instead of \"go with you.\" So perhaps converting questions into more formal or archaic phrasing, replacing verbs with synonyms?\n\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   - The original informal slang (\"fire\") is replaced with a more standard expression (\"incredibly good\"). So maybe replacing informal expressions with more formal or standard ones?\n\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - The original statement is rephrased into a suggestion using \"it is suggested\" and changing the structure from negative to positive. So perhaps converting statements into recommendations or suggestions, using more formal language?\n\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - The phrase \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival.\" So maybe replacing common phrases with more formal or elevated alternatives?\n\nLooking at all these transformations, there are a few recurring elements:\n- Formalization: Converting informal or conversational language into more formal or written English.\n- Synonym substitution: Replacing words with their synonyms (e.g., \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\").\n- Changing sentence structure: For example, turning questions into statements or vice versa, adjusting verb tenses, or restructuring clauses.\n- Using more elevated or literary phrasing: Like \"accompany\" instead of \"go with,\" \"suggested\" instead of \"don't think it's a good idea.\"\n\nNow, considering the instruction given to the friend, it's likely that the task was to convert each input into a more formal, elevated version. But let's check if there's a specific pattern or transformation applied consistently across all examples.\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail:\n\n1. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - \"Whole\" vs. \"entire\": Both mean complete, but \"entire\" is more formal.\n   - \"Made up\" is informal; \"fabricated\" is more formal and precise.\n\n2. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - The question is rephrased using \"shall\" (archaic) and \"accompany\" (more formal than \"go with\").\n   - The original is a request; the output is a more formal offer.\n\n3. \"This song is fire.\" → \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   - Slang \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good,\" a more standard expression.\n\n4. \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n   - The original is a negative statement; the output is a positive suggestion using \"it is suggested.\"\n   - The structure changes from a direct statement to a conditional suggestion.\n\n5. \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - \"Once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way to express the same idea.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might have been to transform each input into a more formal, elevated version of the statement. This could involve several steps:\n- Replacing informal or colloquial expressions with more formal ones.\n- Adjusting sentence structure to make it more polite or professional.\n- Using synonyms that are more precise or elevated in tone.\n- Converting questions into statements or vice versa, depending on context.\n- Restructuring clauses to improve clarity or formality.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to follow a pattern of making the language more formal, possibly through synonym substitution and restructuring. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"made up\" → \"fabricated,\" \"go with you\" → \"accompany you,\" etc. Also, the second example uses \"shall\" which is a more formal auxiliary verb compared to \"do you want.\"\n\nAdditionally, the fourth example transforms a negative statement into a positive suggestion, which might indicate that the instruction involved rephrasing opinions or suggestions into more formal recommendations.\n\nSo, synthesizing all these observations, the most plausible instruction would be something like: \"Convert each input into a more formal, elevated version of the statement, using synonyms and restructuring sentences as needed.\" Alternatively, it could be more specific, such as \"Replace informal expressions with their formal equivalents and adjust the sentence structure for politeness and formality.\"\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a more precise instruction. For instance, the first example replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" The third example replaces \"fire\" with \"incredibly good.\" The second example uses \"shall\" and \"accompany.\" The fourth example turns a negative statement into a suggestion. The fifth example replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nAnother possible pattern is that the instruction might involve making the language more passive or using more formal verbs. For example, \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that...\" which is a more formal way to present a recommendation.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to translate the input into a more polite or formal register, which often involves using more elevated vocabulary and restructuring sentences.\n\nConsidering all these possibilities, the instruction is likely to be about transforming the input into a more formal, elevated version. The key elements are synonym substitution, restructuring sentences, and using more formal language structures.\n\nTo confirm, let's test this hypothesis against all examples:\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" ✔️ Formal synonyms.\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" ✔️ Formal phrasing, synonym substitution.\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" ✔️ Formal synonym.\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" ✔️ Negative to positive suggestion, formal structure.\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" ✔️ Formal synonym substitution.\n\nAll examples align with the hypothesis. Therefore, the instruction was probably to convert each input into a more formal, elevated version of the statement by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure for politeness and formality, and using more precise or elevated vocabulary.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to the friend was to **convert each input into a more formal, elevated version of the statement**.

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n4. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n5. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction involves rephrasing the input into a more formal or standardized version. Let's break down each pair.\n\n1. The first input uses \"got\" which is informal, and the output uses \"understood,\" which is more formal. So perhaps replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n2. The second input uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is phrased as a negative, but the output uses \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more neutral way of expressing the same idea. Maybe converting negative statements into more positive or neutral phrasing?\n3. The third input has a possessive pronoun \"I\" in the middle of the sentence. The output replaces \"I met\" with \"whom I met,\" changing the pronoun from subject case to object case. Wait, but \"whom\" is the objective form. However, the original sentence uses \"I met,\" which is correct. But the output changes \"I\" to \"whom.\" That might be part of a larger structure. Let me check: the original is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. In English, after \"whom\" (the relative pronoun), the subject is still in the nominative case unless it's a non-restrictive clause. Wait, but in this case, \"whom I met\" is the relative clause modifying \"lawyer.\" The subject of the relative clause is \"I,\" which is correct because the relative pronoun \"who\" would be used if it were the subject. But since it's \"whom,\" which is the object of the verb \"met,\" the subject of the relative clause is still \"I,\" so using \"whom\" is incorrect here. Wait, that's a problem. Because in the original input, the correct relative pronoun should be \"who\" if \"I\" is the subject. But the output uses \"whom,\" which is wrong. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Wait, maybe the original input had a typo? Or perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts? Let me check again. Original input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is from \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" But \"whom\" is the object form. If the original sentence is grammatically correct, then the output is incorrect. Unless there's a different context. Wait, maybe the original input was supposed to have \"me\" instead of \"I\"? Like \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful.\" Then changing \"me\" to \"whom\" would make sense. But the input as given is \"I met,\" which is correct. So this seems like an error in the output. But assuming the input is correct, the output is grammatically incorrect. Therefore, maybe the instruction isn't about grammar correction. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert all instances of \"I\" to \"me\" when they are objects. Let's see: in the third input, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause. The relative pronoun \"who\" would be correct here. But the output uses \"whom,\" which is the object form. So that's a mistake. Unless the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" whenever possible. But in the original input, \"I\" is the subject, so replacing it with \"me\" would be incorrect. Therefore, this might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert all instances of \"I\" to \"me\" regardless of context, which would be grammatically incorrect. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps this example is an exception, or maybe there's another pattern here. Let's move on and see other examples.\n\n4. The fourth input is \"I think that this is interesting.\" The output is \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" So here, the original is a first-person statement, and the output is phrased as a third-person statement with \"my opinion.\" This seems like converting a personal belief into a more formal expression of opinion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase statements into a more formal or objective tone, possibly by removing first-person references or adding qualifiers like \"it is my opinion\" or \"in my view.\"\n\n5. The fifth input is \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a group's opinion (\"We don't think...\"), and the output is a suggestion phrased as a passive voice statement. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase opinions or suggestions into more formal or authoritative statements, possibly using passive voice or impersonal constructions.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might involve converting informal or first-person statements into more formal, objective, or standardized phrasing. Let's see if we can find a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first four examples:\n\n1. Informal \"got\" → formal \"understood.\"\n2. Negative phrasing → neutral phrasing.\n3. Changing \"I\" to \"whom\" (though that's grammatically incorrect in the original, maybe the input was different).\n4. Personal belief → formal opinion.\n5. Group opinion → suggestion.\n\nWait, the third example might be a red herring if the input was actually \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful,\" but since the input is given as \"I met,\" perhaps the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain contexts. But that's inconsistent with the other examples. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert all instances of \"I\" to \"me\" when they are objects, but in the original input, \"I\" is the subject, so that wouldn't apply. Therefore, perhaps that example is an exception, and the main pattern is about formalizing language.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, many start with \"It is...\" or \"It is suggested that...\" which are more formal ways of expressing opinions or suggestions. For example, the fourth output starts with \"It is my opinion,\" and the fifth with \"It is suggested.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or standardized structure, often starting with \"It is...\" or similar phrases.\n\nLet's check the first example: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" So replacing \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is a synonym but more formal. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more neutral phrasing. \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which is a more formal way of stating an opinion. \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested that...\" which is a more formal way of presenting a suggestion.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or standardized version, often using \"It is...\" structures to present opinions or suggestions. Additionally, some examples involve changing pronouns or verb forms to match the new structure.\n\nBut wait, the third example's output seems problematic. If the input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful,\" the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" But \"whom\" is the object form, and in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the relative clause. The relative pronoun should be \"who\" if it's the subject. So the output is grammatically incorrect unless the input was \"The lawyer me met yesterday was helpful,\" which would make \"whom\" correct. Since the input is given as \"I met,\" the output is grammatically wrong, which suggests either a mistake in the input-output pair or that the instruction isn't about grammar correction. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, regardless of context, which would be incorrect but might explain the third example. However, that would conflict with the other examples where \"I\" is replaced with \"my opinion\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert all instances of \"I\" to \"me\" when they are objects, but in the third example, \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause, so replacing it with \"me\" would be incorrect. Therefore, that example might not fit the pattern. Maybe the third example is an exception, and the rest follow the formalization pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style, often using \"it is\" constructions to present opinions<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output. Let me start by listing them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n2. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n3. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n5. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\nAlright, let's analyze each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input uses \"can't stand\" which is a contraction, and the output replaces it with \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction is to expand contractions? But wait, the second input doesn't have any contractions. Let me check. The second input is \"I considered many approaches.\" There's no contraction here. So that might not be the case. Wait, but the third input is \"See you tonight.\" The contraction \"see you\" is expanded to \"I look forward to meeting you\". Oh, right! So in the third example, the input is a contraction (\"See you\") which is expanded into a full sentence. But the first input's contraction is also expanded. So maybe the instruction is to expand contractions in the input? But then why does the second input not have any contractions? Maybe the instruction is more general. Let me check the other examples.\n\nFourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So perhaps replacing certain words or phrases. Let's see. \"whole\" vs \"entire\"—maybe synonyms. \"made up\" is a phrase meaning something is fictional, so \"fabricated\" is another way to say that. Similarly, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\"—another synonym. \"considered many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\"—so changing the structure from active voice to passive? Wait, the second input's output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" The original is \"I considered many approaches.\" So the subject changes from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb becomes passive. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a different voice or structure?\n\nLooking at the third input: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" So here, the contraction is expanded, and the greeting is transformed into a statement expressing anticipation. The fourth input's transformation is about synonyms and possibly passive voice. The fifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or rephrased versions.\n\nWait, but the first input's contraction is expanded, the second input's sentence structure is changed (active to passive?), the third is expanding a contraction and changing the greeting, the fourth is replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\", and the fifth is replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\".\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a common thread here. For the first two inputs, maybe it's about expanding contractions and changing the voice. The third is expanding a contraction and rephrasing a greeting. The fourth and fifth are replacing specific phrases with synonyms or rephrased versions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more formal ones. Let's check:\n\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – more formal.\n- \"considered many approaches\" → \"Various approaches were considered\" – maybe making it more formal by using \"various\" and passive voice.\n- \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" – more formal and polite.\n- \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" – same meaning but more formal.\n- \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" – \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal way to express the same idea.\n\nSo all these outputs seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. The first input's contraction is expanded, but the rest are about phrasing in a more formal tone. However, the first input's contraction expansion might be part of making it more formal. But why would the second input, which has no contractions, still be transformed? Because the second input's structure is changed from active to passive. Wait, the second input is \"I considered many approaches.\" The output is \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb is in passive voice. That seems like a significant structural change. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal style, possibly changing the voice or the structure.\n\nBut looking at the third input, the contraction is expanded, but the rest of the sentence remains the same. So maybe the instruction is to expand contractions and make the rest of the sentence more formal. But the second input's transformation is more than just expanding a contraction; it's changing the voice and structure. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal style, which could involve expanding contractions, changing voice, replacing certain phrases, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more polite or formal version. For example, \"See you tonight\" is a casual greeting, which is turned into a more formal expression of anticipation. \"Please call once you get there\" is turned into a more formal phrasing. \"Can't stand\" is made more formal. \"Considered many approaches\" is rephrased as \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a more formal way of saying it. \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated,\" which is a more formal synonym. So all these transformations seem to aim for formality.\n\nBut why does the second input require changing the voice? Because \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches,\" and the verb is in passive voice. That's a structural change. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal style, which may include changing the voice, expanding contractions, replacing certain phrases, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more formal vocabulary. For example, \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand,\" \"various\" instead of \"many,\" \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you,\" \"entire\" instead of \"whole,\" \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" So perhaps the instruction is to replace informal words/phrases with their more formal equivalents, while also adjusting the sentence structure for formality.\n\nBut how do we reconcile the second input's structural change? If the instruction is to make the sentence more formal, then changing the voice from active to passive might be part of that. For example, \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject is changed to \"approaches\" and the verb is passive. This could be part of making the sentence more formal and less personal.\n\nSimilarly, the third input's contraction is expanded, which is a formality aspect. The fourth input's \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" which is a synonym. The fifth input's \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal prepositional phrase.\n\nSo putting this all together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly involving expanding contractions, changing the voice, replacing certain words with their formal equivalents, and restructuring the sentence where necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert the input into a more polite or formal version, which includes expanding contractions, changing the voice, replacing certain phrases, etc. Let's test this hypothesis against all the examples.\n\nFirst input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This replaces the contraction with a more formal word. Second input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the voice is changed to passive, and \"many\" becomes \"various,\" which is a more formal adjective. Third input: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This expands the contraction and changes the greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. Fourth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated,\" both formal terms. Fifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Replaces the informal \"once you get there\" with the formal \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nYes, this seems consistent. All transformations aim to make the language more formal. The second input's structural change from active to passive is part of this formalization. The first input's contraction expansion is also part of making it more formal. The third input's greeting is rephrased into a more formal expression. The fourth and fifth inputs use synonyms that are more formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely was to rephrase each<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the instruction given to the friend.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n   - The main verb changed from \"stand\" to \"tolerate\". Both are about enduring something unpleasant. Maybe synonyms or similar in meaning?\n\n2. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n   - The phrase \"once you get there\" became \"upon your arrival\". So \"upon\" is replacing \"once\", and \"your arrival\" instead of \"you get there\". Maybe it's rephrasing using a more formal expression?\n\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n   - The direct \"thanks\" turned into a longer phrase acknowledging their help. Perhaps converting gratitude into a more formal or specific expression of appreciation?\n\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n   - \"Looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\". Again, synonyms but maybe different connotations? Or perhaps a more formal term?\n\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the relative pronoun changed from \"I\" (improperly used as an object) to \"whom\". Wait, the original input has \"I met\", which is correct, but the output uses \"whom\", which is the objective form. Wait, no—the input says \"I met\", which is correct because \"met\" is a past tense verb that takes the subject form. But the output uses \"whom\", which is the object form. That seems odd unless there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the input was actually \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" and the output is correcting it to \"I met\"? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking back at the input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction might have been to change \"I\" to \"whom\" when referring to the subject of the clause. But why would that be the case? Unless the original input had a mistake, but the user presented it correctly. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the subject pronoun in the relative clause to the object form. Wait, but in the input, \"I met\" is correct. The output changes \"I\" to \"whom\", which is incorrect unless there's a different context. This might be a trick example. Let me check again. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the instruction could be to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in such cases. But why? Maybe the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb. Wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause, and \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. So \"I\" is correct. Changing it to \"whom\" would be incorrect unless there's a different structure. This seems like an error in the output, but assuming the outputs are correct as given, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" or \"whom\" in certain contexts. But this example is confusing. Maybe the actual instruction was to use a different relative pronoun, but that doesn't fit with the other examples. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal way, but the fifth example doesn't fit that pattern. Hmm.\n\nLet me look at the other examples first. For the first four, the outputs seem to be rephrasing the inputs with synonyms or more formal terms. The fifth example is different because it's changing the relative pronoun. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, but the fifth example is an exception. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version, but in the fifth case, they changed the relative pronoun. Wait, but the fifth input is already grammatically correct. Maybe the instruction was to use a different relative pronoun when the antecedent is a person. For example, using \"who\" instead of \"that\" or \"which\", but in this case, \"lawyer\" is a person, so \"who\" is correct. The original uses \"I\", which is correct. Changing it to \"whom\" would be wrong unless there's a different reason. This inconsistency makes me think that maybe the fifth example is a mistake, but since the user provided it, I need to consider it as part of the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in certain positions, but that doesn't fit the first example. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input 1: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" No change in pronoun here. So that's not it.\n\nInput 2: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" No pronoun change here either.\n\nInput 3: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Still no pronoun change.\n\nInput 4: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Pronoun remains \"she\".\n\nInput 5: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I\" becomes \"whom\". So maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"whom\" in relative clauses? But why? Unless the original input had a mistake, but the user presented it correctly. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun refers to the subject of the main clause. Wait, in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause, and \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. So \"I\" is correct. Changing it to \"whom\" would be incorrect. Unless the instruction was to change \"I\" to \"me\" in all cases, but that doesn't fit the first example. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use \"whom\" when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb. But in the original sentence, \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. Hmm.\n\nThis fifth example is puzzling. Let me check the other examples again. All others don't involve pronoun changes. So maybe the fifth example is an exception, perhaps due to a typo in the input or output. But assuming the outputs are correct, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, but in the fifth case, they changed the relative pronoun. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a different relative pronoun, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\" in all cases, but that doesn't fit the first example. Wait, the first input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" If the instruction was to replace \"I\" with \"me\", the output would be \"Me cannot stand his temper.\" Which doesn't make sense. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version, using more complex structures. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal verbs, etc. Let's see:\n\nInput 1: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So \"can't\" becomes \"cannot\", and \"stand\" becomes \"tolerate\". Both are more formal.\n\nInput 2: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\" \"Once\" becomes \"upon your arrival\", which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea.\n\nInput 3: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Direct thanks converted into a longer phrase of appreciation.\n\nInput 4: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" \"Looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles\", which is a synonym but perhaps more formal.\n\nInput 5: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the relative pronoun changed from \"I\" to \"whom\". Wait, but \"I\" is correct in the original. Changing it to \"whom\" would be incorrect unless there's a different reason. Maybe the instruction was to use the objective case when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb. But in the original sentence, \"I\" is the subject of the relative clause. So that doesn't apply. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to change \"I\" to \"me\" in all cases, but that doesn't fit the first example. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use \"whom\" when the antecedent is a person, but that's not standard unless in specific contexts. This seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the fifth example is a mistake. Let me double-check. The input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to reverse-engineer the instruction based on how each input was transformed into the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations applied to each input:\n\n1. Input: Please call once you get there.\n   Output: Please call upon your arrival.\n\n2. Input: I can't tell the difference between these two.\n   Output: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\n\n3. Input: Do you want me to go with you?\n   Output: Shall I accompany you?\n\n4. Input: The whole story was made up.\n   Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n\n5. Input: Thanks for your help.\n   Output: Your assistance is much appreciated.\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction was something like \"Rewrite the sentence using more formal language\" or \"Polish the sentence for better formality.\" Let's check each output against this hypothesis.\n\nFor the first input, changing \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\" seems like a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal phrasing. The third input changes \"Do you want me...\" to \"Shall I accompany you?\" That's a shift from a question asking permission to a suggestion using \"shall I,\" which is more formal. The fourth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" Both are synonyms but more formal terms. The fifth input turns \"Thanks for your help\" into \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a more formal and longer way of expressing gratitude.\n\nSo, putting this together, the instruction might have been to rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nFirst example: Original is informal (\"call once you get there\"), output uses \"upon your arrival\" which is more formal. Check.\n\nSecond example: \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Formality increase here. Check.\n\nThird example: \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a common formalization technique where questions are turned into offers or suggestions. Check.\n\nFourth example: \"whole story was made up\" → \"entire story was fabricated.\" Both are correct, but \"entire\" is more formal than \"whole,\" and \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" but more formal. Check.\n\nFifth example: \"Thanks for your help\" → \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" This is a more formal and longer expression of thanks. Check.\n\nAll examples seem to fit the pattern of converting informal or conversational language into more formal, polite, or elevated phrasing. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rewrite each input into a more formal version, possibly emphasizing politeness or formality through vocabulary choice and sentence structure.\n\nAnother possible angle: Could it be about rephrasing in another language? But the outputs are in English, so probably not. The outputs are all in English, just more formal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate into a more elegant or literary style, but the examples don't show translation; they show adjustments within the same language.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more concise or precise. For example, \"Please call once you get there\" could be seen as slightly abrupt, and the output smooths it out. But the other examples don't necessarily fit conciseness. For instance, \"find it hard to distinguish\" is longer than \"can't tell the difference,\" so that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms. Let's check:\n\n- \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival\": Same meaning, different prepositions and adjectives.\n- \"Can't tell\" → \"Find it hard\": Different verbs.\n- \"Do you want me...\" → \"Shall I accompany you\": Different modal verb (do vs. shall).\n- \"Whole\" → \"Entire\": Synonym.\n- \"Made up\" → \"Fabricated\": Synonym.\n\nSo replacing words with synonyms or rephrasing to use more formal alternatives. That fits with the instruction being to rewrite using more formal language.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is to rewrite each input into a more formal version, possibly by replacing informal expressions with their more formal counterparts, adjusting sentence structures for politeness, and using more elevated vocabulary.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version**, emphasizing refined vocabulary, structured phrasing, and elevated tone. This involved replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structures for politeness, and using synonyms to enhance formality. \n\n**Example Transformations:**\n1. **\"Once you get there\"** → **\"Upon your arrival\"** (replacing casual phrasing with a formal prepositional phrase).\n2. **\"Can't tell the difference\"** → **\"Find it hard to distinguish\"** (substituting informal verbs with more formal alternatives).\n3. **\"Do you want me...\"** → **\"Shall I accompany you?\"** (converting a request into a polite offer using \"shall\").\n4. **\"Whole story\"** → **\"Entire story\"** (synonym substitution for increased formality).\n5. **\"Made up\"** → **\"Fabricated\"** (replacing colloquial terms with more precise synonyms).\n\nThis systematic approach ensures clarity, respect, and sophistication in communication.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see what transformation or rule is applied here.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output is \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" So the original sentence uses \"can't stand,\" which is a common expression meaning they can't bear something. The output replaces \"stand\" with \"tolerate,\" which has a similar meaning but slightly different connotation. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with synonyms that have a similar meaning but phrased differently.\n\nLooking at the second input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, the question is rephrased using \"shall\" instead of \"do you want,\" and \"accompany\" instead of \"go with.\" So perhaps the instruction involves converting questions into more formal or polite phrasing, replacing verbs with their base forms or more formal equivalents.\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" The verb \"got\" here is colloquial, meaning \"understood.\" The output uses \"understood,\" which is a direct synonym. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their standard synonyms.\n\nFourth input: \"See you tonight.\" Output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a more formal or positive way of saying goodbye. So the instruction might involve transforming casual farewells into more formal expressions of anticipation.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, the prepositional phrase \"I met\" is changed to \"whom I met,\" introducing a relative clause with \"whom\" instead of \"who.\" Wait, but in the original, it's \"I met\" without a relative pronoun. The output adds \"whom,\" changing the structure. So maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses with specific relative pronouns? Or perhaps to make the sentence more formal by using \"whom\" where appropriate.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Let's list possible patterns:\n\n1. Replace informal expressions with more formal ones (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n2. Convert questions into more formal or polite requests (e.g., \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\").\n3. Replace colloquial verbs with their standard synonyms (e.g., \"got\" → \"understood\").\n4. Transform casual farewells into more formal anticipatory statements (e.g., \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you\").\n5. Change possessive pronouns into relative clauses with \"whom\" (though this seems less clear; maybe it's about making the sentence more complex or formal).\n\nWait, the fifth example's output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" That's a bit confusing. Maybe the instruction is to insert relative clauses where possible, using \"whom\" to make the sentence more formal. But why only in that case? Alternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the sentence structure to be more formal, using more complex constructions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first four examples, the main pattern seems to be replacing informal or conversational language with more formal or standard English. For instance:\n\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal)\n- \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (more formal, using \"shall\" which is less common now but more formal)\n- \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" (using \"understood\" as a synonym for \"got\")\n- \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (changing the perspective from immediate to future anticipation)\n\nThe fifth example seems to fit into the same category: changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. However, \"whom\" is typically used when the subject is the object of the verb. In the original, \"I met\" is the subject of the sentence, so \"whom\" isn't grammatically correct unless there's a relative clause. Wait, the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, \"whom\" is added as the object of the relative clause introduced by \"was.\" So the instruction might be to insert relative clauses with \"whom\" where possible, making the sentence more formal.\n\nBut why only in the fifth example? Maybe the instruction is to convert possessive pronouns into relative clauses with \"whom\" whenever possible. Let's check the other examples. The first four don't involve possessive pronouns. The fifth example does. So perhaps the instruction is to replace possessive pronouns with relative clauses using \"whom\" when they refer to people. For example, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence structure to use more formal language, including inserting relative clauses with \"whom\" in certain contexts. But that seems a bit specific.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. The first four examples replace informal expressions with more standard or formal ones. The fifth example changes the structure to be more formal by adding a relative clause with \"whom.\"\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with their standard synonyms, converting questions into more polite requests, rephrasing casual language into more formal terms, and structuring sentences with more complex clauses where appropriate.\"\n\nBut let's verify if that fits all examples.\n\nFirst input: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal). Check.\n\nSecond input: \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\" (more formal). Check.\n\nThird input: \"got\" → \"understood\" (synonym). Check.\n\nFourth input: \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you\" (formal anticipation). Check.\n\nFifth input: \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (relative clause for formality). Check.\n\nYes, that seems to cover all cases. So the instruction is likely to rewrite each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with standard synonyms, converting questions into polite requests, rephrasing casual language into more formal terms, and structuring sentences with more complex clauses where appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, another possible instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version, which would encompass all these changes. For example, using \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand,\" \"shall\" instead of \"do you want,\" \"understood\" instead of \"got,\" \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you,\" and adding \"whom\" to make the sentence more formal.\n\nTherefore, the instruction given to the friend was to rephrase each input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with their standard synonyms, converting questions into more polite requests, rephrasing casual language into more formal terms, and structuring sentences with more complex clauses where appropriate.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace informal expressions with standard synonyms**:  \n   - \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\"  \n   - \"got\" → \"understood\"  \n\n2. **Convert questions into polite requests**:  \n   - \"Do you want...\" → \"Shall I...\"  \n\n3. **Rephrase casual language into formal terms**:  \n   - \"See you...\" → \"look forward to meeting you\"  \n\n4. **Enhance sentence structure with complex clauses**:  \n   - \"I met\" → \"whom I met\" (introducing a relative clause for formality).  \n\nThis systematic approach ensures that each input is transformed into a more formal, polite, and linguistically precise output.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the initial instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n2. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n3. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n4. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n5. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, maybe the instruction was about rephrasing or converting certain phrases into more formal or standardized language? Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a question phrased in a casual way (\"Do you want...\"), and the output is a more formal question using \"Shall I...\" which is a polite suggestion. So perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into polite requests or suggestions, especially when offering help.\n\nSecond input: \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal expression. So maybe the instruction involves replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nThird input: The original statement is a negative opinion (\"We don't think it's a good idea...\") and the output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" followed by the negation. This seems like converting a negative opinion into a positive suggestion using \"it is suggested that\" and restructuring the sentence. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations, possibly using \"suggested\" or similar constructions.\n\nFourth input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" The subject-verb structure changes from \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a more general or passive voice version. Maybe the instruction was to convert first-person singular statements into third-person plural or general statements, or to use more formal language like \"various\" instead of \"many.\"\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" is replaced with \"entire,\" and \"made up\" is converted to \"fabricated.\" So perhaps the instruction involved replacing certain words with their synonyms or more formal terms.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might have been to rephrase the given sentences into more formal or standardized English, possibly converting questions into polite requests, informal expressions into formal ones, negative opinions into positive suggestions, first-person statements into more general or passive voice, and replacing informal words with their more formal counterparts.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a common thread here. For example, the first example converts a question into a suggestion, the second replaces \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival,\" the third turns a negative opinion into a suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that,\" the fourth changes \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered,\" and the fifth replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs. In the first input, \"want\" becomes \"accompany\" (a verb used in the output). Wait, no—the output is a question starting with \"Shall I accompany you?\" So the original question is about wanting someone to go, and the output is a suggestion for the speaker to accompany. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a polite request or suggestion, especially when offering assistance.\n\nSimilarly, the second input's output uses \"call upon your arrival\" which is a more formal way of saying \"call once you get there.\" So replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nThird input: The original is a negative statement, and the output is a positive suggestion. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations, possibly using \"it is suggested that\" and restructuring the sentence.\n\nFourth input: Changing \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert first-person statements into third-person or general statements, using more formal language like \"various\" instead of \"many.\"\n\nFifth input: Replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" So replacing informal adjectives with their more formal counterparts.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely required the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version of English. The key elements would involve:\n\n1. Converting questions into polite requests or suggestions, especially when offering help.\n2. Replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n3. Transforming negative statements into positive recommendations.\n4. Converting first-person statements into more general or passive voice constructions.\n5. Replacing informal words with their more formal synonyms.\n\nNow, putting this into a coherent instruction. The original instruction probably said something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version of English, particularly by converting questions into polite requests, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, transforming negative statements into positive recommendations, converting first-person statements into general or passive voice, and replacing informal words with their more formal counterparts.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was more specific, like \"Convert each input into a more polite and formal version,\" but given the examples, the above seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's another possible instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to translate the inputs into another language and then back, but that seems less likely since the outputs are in English. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to use a thesaurus to replace words with synonyms, but the fifth example shows \"whole\" to \"entire\" and \"made up\" to \"fabricated,\" which are direct synonyms rather than thesaurus replacements. However, the fourth example changes \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches,\" which is a synonym but not exactly a thesaurus replacement. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to rephrase the inputs into a more formal tone, which encompasses all the transformations observed. For instance, making the language more polite, using more formal structures, replacing colloquialisms with more formal terms, etc.\n\nAnother possibility: The instruction was to convert the inputs into a more indirect or polite form, such as turning commands into requests, or using \"shall\" instead of \"will\" or \"do.\" But looking at the first example, the input is a question, and the output is a suggestion phrased as a question. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a polite request or suggestion, especially when offering help.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to convert the inputs into a more formal version by using more complex sentence structures, replacing contractions with full forms, etc. But the examples show various transformations, so it's hard to pinpoint a single instruction.\n\nWait, let's look at the third example again: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a negative statement, and the output is a positive suggestion phrased as \"it is suggested that...\" So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase negative statements into positive recommendations, possibly using \"it is suggested that\" and restructuring the sentence to present a solution.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth example changes \"I considered many approaches\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\" So changing first-person to third-person plural, and \"many\" to \"various,\" which is a synonym but also a more formal term.\n\nThe fifth example replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\" These are direct synonyms but more formal versions.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction likely required the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version of English, focusing on several key areas:\n\n1. Converting questions into polite requests or suggestions, especially when offering help.\n2. Replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n3. Transforming negative statements into positive recommendations.\n4. Converting first-person statements into more general or passive voice constructions.\n5. Replacing informal words with their more formal counterparts.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction was probably something along the lines of: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version of English, particularly by converting questions into polite requests, replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents, transforming negative statements into positive recommendations, converting first-person statements into general or passive voice, and replacing informal words with their more formal counterparts.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been more concise, like \"Convert each input into a more polite and formal version,\" but given the examples, the detailed breakdown makes sense. To confirm, let's check if all the examples fit this instruction.\n\nFirst example fits: question becomes a polite suggestion.\n\nSecond example: informal \"once you get there\" becomes formal \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nThird example: negative statement becomes a positive recommendation.\n\nFourth example: first-person \"I considered\" becomes third-person \"various approaches were considered.\"\n\nFifth example: informal \"whole\" and \"made up\" replaced with formal \"entire\" and \"fabricated.\"\n\nYes, all examples align with the proposed instruction. Therefore, the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version of English,<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule from the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. → Output: She resembles her sister.\n2. Input: I considered many approaches. → Output: Various approaches were considered.\n3. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now. → Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n4. Input: Please call once you get there. → Output: Please call upon your arrival.\n5. Input: I got what you said. → Output: I understood you.\n\nHmm. Let's look at each transformation step by step.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input uses \"looks like\" and the output uses \"resembles\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases or rephrase them in a more formal way? Like, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\"? But wait, the second input is \"considered many approaches\" becoming \"various approaches were considered\". Here, the structure changes: the subject \"I\" becomes \"Various approaches\", and the verb phrase \"considered\" is moved to the end. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or passive voice?\n\nThird input: The original is a negative statement about not doing anything, and the output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using \"it is suggested that\".\n\nFourth input: \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival\". The preposition \"once\" is replaced with \"upon\", and the structure is slightly adjusted. Maybe the instruction involves replacing certain conjunctions or phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\". So here, the verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object \"what you said\" is rephrased as \"you\".\n\nSo putting these together, the instruction might involve several transformations. Let's categorize possible rules:\n\n1. **Rephrasing common phrases**: For example, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\", \"considered many approaches\" to \"various approaches were considered\", etc.\n2. **Changing sentence structure**: Like moving the subject to the end (e.g., \"We don't think...\" becomes \"It is suggested...\").\n3. **Replacing verbs or phrases**: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\", \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\".\n4. **Formalizing language**: Using more formal or passive voice constructions.\n\nNow, looking at all the outputs, they seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example, the first output is more formal than the input. The third input is a negative statement, and the output is a polite suggestion. The fourth input is a request phrased in a less formal way, and the output uses a more formal \"upon your arrival\".\n\nWait, but the first input's output is also more formal. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check each example against this hypothesis.\n\n1. Original: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\" Both are similar in formality. Maybe the instruction is to replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\", which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. However, \"resemble\" is actually more formal than \"look like\". So maybe the instruction is to use more formal synonyms where possible.\n\n2. \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" Here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb is moved to the end. This seems like making it passive voice. But the original is active voice. So maybe the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive voice, but only when certain conditions are met? Or perhaps it's a different transformation.\n\n3. \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This is a significant change. The original is a negative statement expressing hesitation, and the output is a polite suggestion phrased as a recommendation. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using \"it is suggested that\".\n\n4. \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The preposition \"once\" is replaced with \"upon\", and the structure is adjusted. So maybe the instruction is to replace \"once you [verb]\" with \"upon your [gerund]\".\n\n5. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" The verb \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\", and the object is rephrased. So perhaps the instruction is to replace certain verbs with their more formal counterparts and adjust the sentence structure accordingly.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might be a combination of several transformations. Let's try to see if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often start with a more formal greeting or phrase. For example, the third output starts with \"It is suggested...\", which is a formal way to make a suggestion. The fourth output uses \"Please call upon your arrival\", which is a more formal way of saying \"when you arrive, please call\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly using specific transformations like replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\", changing \"considered\" to \"were considered\", etc.\n\nWait, let's check the third input again. The original is \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" The output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" So the key here is converting a negative statement into a positive suggestion. The structure here is creating a suggestion using \"it is suggested that\" followed by a clause. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions using this structure.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth input is a request phrased as a polite instruction, and the output uses a more formal phrasing. The fifth input is a simple replacement of \"got\" with \"understood\".\n\nLooking at the first two outputs, \"resembles\" vs. \"look like\"—maybe the instruction is to replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\", but also other similar phrases. However, the second input is \"considered many approaches\" becoming \"various approaches were considered\". So here, the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various approaches\", and the verb is moved to the end. That seems like a passive voice conversion, but only when the subject is \"I\" or \"we\"?\n\nWait, the third input's subject is \"We\", and the output is passive. The first input's subject is \"She\", but the output is still active. So maybe the instruction is to convert active sentences to passive voice when the subject is \"I\" or \"we\", but leave others as is. But the second input's subject is \"I\", and the output is passive. Let's check:\n\nSecond input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\" So here, the subject \"I\" becomes \"Various approaches\", and the verb is moved to the end. So maybe whenever the subject is \"I\" or \"we\", convert to passive voice. But the first input's subject is \"She\", so it remains active. Third input's subject is \"We\", so becomes passive. Fourth input's subject is implied (\"you\"), but the output is \"Please call upon your arrival\"—so maybe that's a different case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the entire sentence into a more formal version, regardless of the subject. But then why does the first input's output not change the subject? Because \"She\" is the subject, and \"resembles\" is the verb. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases but not others. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal version by using specific transformations. For example:\n\n- Replace \"look like\" with \"resemble\"\n- Replace \"considered\" with \"were considered\" (passive voice)\n- Replace \"don't think it's a good idea to do anything\" with \"it is suggested that no action should be taken\"\n- Replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival\"\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\"\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, using specific transformations. For example, replacing \"look like\" with \"resemble\", changing \"considered\" to \"were considered\", converting negative statements into suggestions, replacing \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival\", and replacing \"got\" with \"understood\".\n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version by applying specific transformations. For example, the instruction might say something like: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal version by replacing 'look like' with 'resemble', changing 'considered' to 'were considered', converting negative statements into suggestions using 'it is suggested that...', replacing 'call once you get there' with 'call<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to have been generated based on a specific rule applied to the input. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule from the examples given.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n2. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n3. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n4. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n5. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nHmm. Let's look at each pair and see what changes were made.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nOriginal: \"The whole story was made up.\"\nOutput: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nBreaking it down:\n- \"whole\" becomes \"entire\"\n- \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\"\n\nSo, replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". That seems like a synonym substitution. But wait, \"whole\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, but \"made up\" (meaning composed entirely) vs \"fabricated\" (which also means made up). So maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms. But why only those two phrases?\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair:\nOriginal: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nHere, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\". So the structure changed. The subject shifted from \"I\" to \"It\", and the verb phrase became \"is my opinion\". So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or indirect way, using \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\".\n\nThird pair:\nOriginal: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\"Once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". So replacing \"once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival\". These are both ways to express the same idea, but \"upon your arrival\" is more formal. So maybe the instruction was to replace casual expressions with more formal ones.\n\nFourth pair:\nOriginal: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n\"Looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". Again, synonyms. So perhaps replacing informal expressions with more formal ones.\n\nFifth pair:\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the pronoun \"I\" becomes \"whom\". So changing the possessive pronoun to an objective one. This suggests that the instruction might involve grammatical corrections, like replacing \"I\" with \"me\" or \"whom\" depending on the context. Wait, but in the original input, the possessive is \"I met\", so changing \"I\" to \"whom\" would make it \"whom I met\", which is correct because \"whom\" is the object of the preposition \"met\". So maybe the instruction was to convert possessive pronouns to objective ones when they are used as objects.\n\nNow, looking at all these possible transformations:\n\n1. Synonym substitution (whole/entire, made up/fabricated)\n2. Restructuring the sentence to use \"it is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\"\n3. Replacing casual expressions with formal ones (once you get there/upon your arrival)\n4. Synonym substitution (looks/resembles)\n5. Grammatical correction (changing \"I\" to \"whom\")\n\nBut how do these fit into a single instruction? The instruction must be a general rule that applies to all inputs. Let's see if there's a common thread here.\n\nLooking at the outputs, some are more formal, some are grammatically corrected, some are synonym substitutions. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or academic style. For example, replacing contractions (\"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\"), using more formal synonyms, restructuring sentences for clarity, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a passive voice? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Passive voice. The output is passive. Second input: \"I think...\" → not passive. Third: \"Please call...\" → not passive. Fourth: \"She looks...\" → passive. Fifth: \"The lawyer was helpful.\" → passive. Hmm, not all outputs are passive. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the fifth input-output pair. The original uses \"I met\", and the output uses \"whom I met\". So changing the possessive pronoun to an objective one. That's a grammatical correction. So maybe the instruction was to correct pronoun usage, specifically replacing \"I\" with \"me\" or \"whom\" when appropriate.\n\nBut then why does the third input-output pair change \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival\"? That's a different kind of correction. Maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the sentence in a more indirect or polite manner. For example, \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival\" which is slightly more formal and less direct.\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair: \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\". This is a common way to rephrase opinions to sound more formal or less assertive. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence to present the speaker's opinion in a more indirect way.\n\nCombining all these observations, the instruction might be something like: \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal or indirect style, using appropriate synonyms, restructuring where necessary, and correcting grammar where applicable.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against all the examples.\n\nFirst example: \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Using synonyms (whole → entire; made up → fabricated). Also, the sentence structure remains the same. So maybe the instruction isn't about rephrasing but just replacing certain words with synonyms. However, the second example shows a structural change.\n\nSecond example: \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\". This is a structural change, not just a synonym replacement. So the instruction must cover both types of changes.\n\nThird example: \"Please call once you get there\" → \"Please call upon your arrival\". Structural change, replacing a phrase with another.\n\nFourth example: \"She looks like her sister\" → \"She resembles her sister\". Synonym replacement.\n\nFifth example: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful\". Grammatical correction (changing \"I\" to \"whom\").\n\nSo the instruction likely involves multiple steps: replacing certain words with synonyms, restructuring sentences to be more formal, and making grammatical corrections. But how to formulate this as a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version by replacing certain phrases with their more formal equivalents, restructuring sentences, and correcting grammar. For example, replacing contractions, using more formal synonyms, rephrasing for clarity, and ensuring proper grammar.\n\nBut the key is to find a concise instruction that encompasses all these changes. Let's think of possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Convert each sentence into a more formal style by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, restructuring sentences for clarity, and correcting grammatical errors.\"\n2. \"Rephrase each input into a more academic tone by using synonyms, restructuring clauses, and adjusting pronoun usage.\"\n3. \"Transform each input into a more indirect and formal statement by replacing contractions, using more precise vocabulary, and correcting grammatical structures.\"\n\nLooking back at the outputs, the fifth example specifically changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". This is a grammatical correction where \"I\" is the subject, but in the relative clause \"I met\", \"I\" is the subject of the verb \"met\", so it should remain \"I\". Wait, no. Wait, in the original input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I met\" is the past tense of \"meet\", so the subject is \"I\". In the output, it's changed to \"whom I met\". Wait, that's incorrect. Because \"whom\" is the object of the preposition \"met\". Wait, no. Let me parse that sentence.\n\nOriginal: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The structure is \"The lawyer [that] I met yesterday was helpful.\" So \"I met\" is the clause where \"I\" is the subject. So the correct possessive is \"I\", not \"whom\". But the output says \"whom I met\". That seems like a mistake. Unless the instruction was to change \"I\" to \"me\" in all cases, but that doesn't fit the other examples.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the fifth input-output pair. Let me check again:\n\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\nAh, here, the possessive pronoun \"I\" is replaced with \"whom\". But in the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the clause. So \"I\" is correct. Changing it to \"whom\"<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the patterns between each input and output. Let me list them out again:\n\n1. Input: She looks like her sister. → Output: She resembles her sister.\n2. Input: See you tonight. → Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n3. Input: The whole story was made up. → Output: The entire story was fabricated.\n4. Input: I can't tell the difference between these two. → Output: I find it hard to distinguish between them.\n5. Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now. → Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\n\nLooking at these transformations, I notice that some are direct synonyms or rephrasing, while others seem to involve more complex changes. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\n- \"looks like\" becomes \"resembles\". Both mean similar in appearance. So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms. But why not all? For example, \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\", which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\", which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. The third input's output uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole\", which is a slight variation but still a synonym. The fifth input's output changes \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"It is suggested that...\", which is a completely different structure. So maybe the instruction isn't just replacing words with synonyms. There must be a more general rule here.\n\nLet's look at the second input: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to convert informal expressions into more polite or formal language. But then why does the fourth input, \"I can't tell the difference...\", become \"I find it hard to distinguish...\", which is also a more formal version? That fits. The fifth input's output is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion, which might be part of a formal recommendation. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite tone, possibly converting statements into suggestions or recommendations.\n\nBut wait, the third input's output is a synonym substitution (\"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), which could fit both a synonym replacement and a formality increase. However, the first input's output is also a synonym substitution. So maybe the instruction is a combination of both: replacing certain phrases with synonyms and adjusting the formality level. But how to reconcile all cases?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, using more elevated vocabulary and restructuring sentences. Let's check each input-output pair under this hypothesis.\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister.\" → \"She resembles her sister.\" This is a synonym substitution, but \"resembles\" is slightly more formal than \"looks like\". So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more formal ones when possible. But \"resembles\" is a synonym, so that's part of it.\n\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Here, the original is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal expression of anticipation. So this fits a formality upgrade.\n\n3. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Again, synonyms, but \"entire\" vs. \"whole\" is a formality difference. So maybe both synonym substitution and formality adjustment are involved.\n\n4. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Same idea, but phrased more formally. So another formality upgrade.\n\n5. \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" Here, the original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a formal suggestion. This seems like a significant structural change. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, possibly converting statements into recommendations or suggestions.\n\nSo combining these observations, the instruction might be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, using appropriate synonyms and sentence structures.\"\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"She looks like her sister.\" becomes \"She resembles her sister.\" Using \"resembles\" is more formal than \"looks like,\" which fits the formality upgrade. Also, \"resembles\" is a synonym. So that works.\n\nSecond example: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" Changing from a casual greeting to a formal expression of anticipation. That's a formality upgrade.\n\nThird example: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" \"Entire\" is more formal than \"whole,\" and \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up.\" So both formality and synonym substitution.\n\nFourth example: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" Same meaning but more formal phrasing. Fits.\n\nFifth example: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" Here, the original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a formal suggestion. The structure changes from \"We don't think...\" to \"It is suggested that...\". So this is a significant transformation. How does the instruction account for this? If the instruction is about formality, then changing the perspective from first person (we) to third person (it is suggested), and rephrasing the idea as a suggestion rather than a statement of opinion. So perhaps the instruction includes not only formality but also restructuring sentences into more formal or professional phrasing, such as using passive voice, suggestions, or recommendations.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely involves two main components: increasing the formality of the language and rephrasing the content into more professional or polite terms, possibly restructuring sentences into recommendations or suggestions when appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the third input's output, \"entire\" vs. \"whole\" is a synonym substitution. The fifth input's output is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal tone, using synonyms where possible and restructuring sentences into recommendations or suggestions when necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert the input into a more formal or professional version, possibly by replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, and restructuring sentences into more polite or formal expressions.\n\nLet me check if there's a common thread across all outputs. For instance:\n\n- The first output uses \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like.\"\n- The second uses \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you.\"\n- Third uses \"entire\" instead of \"whole.\"\n- Fourth uses \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference.\"\n- Fifth uses \"suggested\" and \"no action should be taken\" instead of \"don't think it's a good idea.\"\n\nSo, in each case, the output is more formal, uses synonyms, and sometimes restructures the sentence. The fifth example is a bit more complex because it's not just a synonym substitution but a complete rephrasing into a suggestion.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or professional tone, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring sentences as needed to convey the same meaning in a more polite or formal manner.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's see if this instruction would generate the outputs from the inputs:\n\n1. \"She looks like her sister.\" → Formal synonym: \"resembles.\"\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → Formal alternative: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n3. \"The whole story was made up.\" → Formal synonym: \"entire\" and \"fabricated.\"\n4. \"I can't tell the difference...\" → Formal synonym: \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n5. \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" → Formal rephrasing: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\"\n\nYes, this seems to fit all cases. The key elements are formality, synonym substitution, and sentence restructuring when necessary. Therefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring sentences as needed.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone**, using appropriate synonyms and restructuring sentences as needed to convey the same meaning in a more polite or formal manner. This involved:\n\n1. **Synonym Substitution**: Replacing informal or less formal terms with their more formal counterparts (e.g., \"resembles\" instead of \"looks like\").\n2. **Formality Upgrade**: Converting casual expressions into more polite or professional phrasing (e.g., \"I look forward to meeting you\" instead of \"See you\").\n3. **Sentence Restructuring**: Reducing first-person perspectives or opinions into neutral, suggestion-based statements (e.g., \"It is suggested...\" instead of \"We don’t think...\").\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures clarity, politeness, and adherence to professional communication standards.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see what transformation or rule was applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Let's break that down. The original question is in the second person, asking if the speaker should go along. The output is a more formal version using \"Shall\" and changing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you\". So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into more polite or formal statements, replacing certain verbs and adjusting the sentence structure.\n\nSecond input: \"Thanks for your help.\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" Here, the output is a more elaborate way of expressing gratitude. Instead of a simple \"thanks\", it's expanded into a longer sentence that emphasizes the value of the help received. So perhaps the instruction involves converting expressions of thanks into more detailed or formal expressions of appreciation.\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" This seems like a direct translation but with a slight change in wording. \"Can't stand\" is replaced with \"cannot tolerate\". So maybe the instruction is to replace informal phrases with their more formal equivalents, especially when expressing inability to endure something.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, the original statement is a concise way of saying they understood. The output is a more active voice and uses \"understood\" instead of \"got what you said\". So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase affirmative statements into more formal or direct expressions of comprehension.\n\nFifth input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" The main change here is the addition of \"whom\" after \"lawyer\". The original uses a relative clause without specifying the relative pronoun, while the output uses \"whom\" to make it more formal. So maybe the instruction is to add relative pronouns (like \"whom\") to make the sentences more formal or grammatically correct according to certain rules.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, the instruction might be to convert the given input into a more formal or polite version. Let's check each case again:\n\n1. Question to more formal question with \"Shall\" and rephrasing \"go with you\" to \"accompany you\".\n2. Gratitude expressed as a longer, more elaborate sentence.\n3. Informal \"can't stand\" replaced with \"cannot tolerate\".\n4. Concise \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you\" for clarity.\n5. Removing the relative clause's ambiguity by adding \"whom\".\n\nWait, but the fifth input's output adds \"whom\", which changes the grammar. So maybe the instruction is to make the sentences more formal by adding specific relative pronouns where appropriate. But why only in the fifth case? Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think about other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using different structures and vocabulary. For example:\n\n- Convert questions into more formal interrogative forms.\n- Expand short expressions of gratitude into longer, more appreciative statements.\n- Replace informal verb phrases with their more formal counterparts.\n- Use more formal or direct expressions for agreement or understanding.\n- Add relative pronouns to clarify relationships in clauses.\n\nBut looking at the fifth example, the original doesn't have any relative clause issues. The output adds \"whom\" to the relative clause \"I met yesterday\". So maybe the instruction is to ensure that all relative clauses use the correct relative pronoun, even if the original didn't specify. For example, in the fifth input, the original uses \"I met yesterday\" without a relative pronoun, but the output adds \"whom\" to make it explicit. That could be part of making the sentence more formal by adhering to strict grammar rules.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely involves transforming each input into a more formal version by applying several rules:\n\n1. Convert questions into more polite or formal interrogative forms (e.g., replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany\").\n2. Expand expressions of gratitude into more elaborate or formal statements (e.g., \"much appreciated\" instead of \"thanks\").\n3. Replace informal verb phrases with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\").\n4. Rephrase affirmative statements into clearer or more direct expressions (e.g., \"I understood you\" instead of \"I got what you said\").\n5. Ensure that relative clauses use the correct relative pronoun (e.g., adding \"whom\" in the fifth example).\n\nAdditionally, the fifth example might also involve making the sentence more formal by specifying the relative pronoun, which wasn't present in the original. So the instruction could include both grammar corrections and style adjustments.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to follow a pattern of increasing formality and specificity. For instance, the first output uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\", which is a more formal verb choice. The second output uses \"assistance\" and \"appreciated\" which are more formal terms. The third uses \"tolerate\" instead of \"stand\", which is a bit more formal. The fourth uses \"understood\" instead of \"got\", which is more direct. The fifth adds \"whom\" to clarify the relative clause.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Convert each input into a more formal and polite version by rephrasing questions, expanding expressions of gratitude, replacing informal verb phrases with their formal equivalents, rephrasing affirmative statements for clarity, and ensuring grammatical correctness by adding relative pronouns where necessary.\"\n\nBut wait, the fifth example's output doesn't just add \"whom\"; it changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met\". So the instruction might specifically require adding the relative pronoun \"whom\" in such cases. However, in the original input, the relative clause was \"I met yesterday\", which is a valid relative clause without a pronoun. Adding \"whom\" makes it more formal. So perhaps the instruction includes a rule to add \"whom\" whenever the relative clause refers to the subject of the main clause.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to always use the relative pronoun \"whom\" in such clauses to make them more formal. But that would be a stylistic choice rather than a grammatical correction. However, in standard English, \"whom\" is often omitted in modern usage, so adding it could be seen as making the sentence more formal.\n\nPutting this all together, the instruction is likely to transform each input into a more formal version by applying these various stylistic and grammatical adjustments. Therefore, the instruction given to the friend was to rephrase each input into a more formal and polite expression, possibly including changes in verb form, sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammar (like adding relative pronouns) to enhance formality.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Question Handling**: Convert questions into more polite or formal interrogative forms. For example:\n   - Original: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"  \n     Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"  \n     *Revised*: Replace \"do you want\" with \"shall I\" and adjust phrasing for politeness.\n\n2. **Gratitude Expansion**: Expand concise expressions of thanks into longer, more elaborate statements.  \n   - Original: \"Thanks for your help.\"  \n     Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"  \n     *Revised*: Replace \"thanks\" with a more formal phrase and emphasize the value of the help.\n\n3. **Formalize Verbs**: Replace informal verb phrases with their more formal equivalents.  \n   - Original: \"I can't stand his temper.\"  \n     Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"  \n     *Revised*: Substitute \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\" for greater formality.\n\n4. **Clarify Affirmations**: Rephrase affirmative statements for clarity and directness.  \n   - Original: \"I got what you said.\"  \n     Output: \"I understood you.\"  \n     *Revised*: Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\" for precision.\n\n5. **Grammatical Precision**: Ensure grammatical correctness by adding relative pronouns (e.g., \"whom\") to clarify relationships in clauses.  \n   - Original: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n     Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"  \n     *Revised*: Insert \"whom\" to specify the relative clause’s antecedent, enhancing formality.\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Transform each input into a more formal and polite response by rephrasing questions, expanding expressions of gratitude, replacing informal verb phrases with their formal equivalents, clarifying affirmations, and ensuring grammatical correctness through the use of relative pronouns like 'whom' where appropriate.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the initial instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot any patterns or common transformations.\n\nInputs:\n1. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\n   Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\n2. \"Please call once you get there.\"\n   Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n\n3. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n\n4. \"See you tonight.\"\n   Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\n5. \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\"\n   Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n\nLooking at these, let's analyze each pair:\n\n1. The first input uses \"can't tell the difference\" which is rephrased as \"find it hard to distinguish.\" Both are about not being able to differentiate. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase expressions of inability to discern into more formal or alternative phrasing.\n\n2. The second input uses \"once you get there\" which is changed to \"upon your arrival.\" Both mean the same thing but use different prepositions. \"Once\" vs. \"upon\" here. Maybe the instruction is to replace certain conjunctions with more formal alternatives.\n\n3. The third input has a possessive pronoun \"I\" followed by \"met yesterday.\" The output uses \"whom\" instead of \"I.\" Wait, in the original input, it's \"I met,\" and the output is \"whom I met.\" Wait, no—the original input is \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" The output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the change is replacing \"I\" with \"whom.\" But why? Because \"I\" is the subject, and \"whom\" is the object. Maybe the instruction is to convert subject pronouns to object pronouns when they follow a preposition? Or perhaps in relative clauses, changing the subject to object? Let me check: In the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject clause. The relative clause is \"who/whom I met.\" So the output replaces \"I\" with \"whom.\" That seems like a possible pattern. Maybe the instruction is to convert subject pronouns to object pronouns in certain contexts, like after prepositions or in relative clauses.\n\n4. The fourth input is a casual greeting \"See you tonight.\" The output is \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a more formal expression of anticipation. So perhaps the instruction is to transform informal greetings into more formal expressions of looking forward to seeing someone.\n\n5. The fifth input is a statement expressing reluctance to act now. The output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" So the original negative statement is turned into a positive suggestion. The structure changes from \"We don't think...\" to \"It is suggested that...\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into positive suggestions or recommendations.\n\nNow, putting all these together, let's see if there's a common thread. Each input-output pair seems to involve a transformation of language style or formality, specific parts of speech, or sentence structure.\n\nBreaking down each transformation:\n\n1. \"can't tell the difference\" → \"find it hard to distinguish\": Both are about inability to differentiate, but the latter is more formal or uses a different phrasing.\n\n2. \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\": Same meaning but using \"upon\" and \"your\" instead of \"you.\"\n\n3. \"I met\" → \"whom I met\": Changing the subject pronoun \"I\" to the object pronoun \"whom\" in the relative clause.\n\n4. \"See you\" → \"look forward to meeting you\": Formalizing the greeting.\n\n5. \"don't think it's a good idea\" → \"it is suggested that...\": Converting a negative opinion into a positive recommendation.\n\nSo, possible instruction categories:\n\n- Formalizing language (making it more polite/formal)\n- Replacing certain conjunctions (e.g., \"once\" → \"upon\")\n- Changing pronouns (subject to object) in specific contexts (like after prepositions or in relative clauses)\n- Transforming negative statements into positive suggestions\n\nBut how do these fit into a single instruction? Let's see if there's a unifying theme.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example, the first output is more formal than the input. The second uses \"upon your arrival\" which is more formal than \"once you get there.\" The third changes \"I\" to \"whom,\" which might be part of a more formal style. The fourth turns a casual greeting into a formal expression of anticipation. The fifth converts a negative statement into a positive suggestion, which is also a form of politeness.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version. However, the third example specifically changes \"I\" to \"whom,\" which is a grammatical change rather than just formality. So maybe the instruction is to make the output more formal, possibly including specific grammatical changes like replacing \"I\" with \"whom\" in certain contexts.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a more formal or professional tone, which would include various transformations like replacing contractions, using more formal conjunctions, changing pronouns, etc.\n\nAnother angle: The third input/output pair shows a change from \"I\" to \"whom.\" In the original sentence, \"I met\" is the subject of the main clause, and \"I met\" in the relative clause. The relative clause uses \"who\" or \"whom\" depending on its function. Since \"I\" is the subject of the main clause, but in the relative clause, it's the subject of the relative clause (\"who I met\"), so \"I\" is correct. However, the output uses \"whom,\" which is the object form. Wait, that's interesting. So in the original input, the relative clause is \"I met [someone].\" The relative clause is \"who/whom I met.\" So the subject of the relative clause is \"I,\" so \"who\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom.\" That seems like a mistake unless there's another context. Wait, maybe the original input had a typo? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal input 3: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So the input uses \"I met,\" and the output uses \"whom I met.\" So the change is from \"I\" to \"whom.\" But in the relative clause, the subject is \"I,\" so \"who\" should be used. Unless there's a different interpretation. Wait, maybe the original input was supposed to have a different structure? Or perhaps the instruction is to change \"I\" to \"whom\" regardless of the context, which would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the input was mistyped. But assuming the inputs are correct, then the output's change from \"I\" to \"whom\" must be intentional. That suggests that the instruction includes converting \"I\" to \"whom\" in certain contexts. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the original input was \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" and the output is the same? No, that doesn't make sense. The user provided input-output pairs where each input maps to a different output. So in input 3, the output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful,\" which is the same as the input except for the \"I\" to \"whom.\" So that's a change. Therefore, the instruction must include changing \"I\" to \"whom\" in such cases. But why would that be part of the instruction? Unless the instruction is to convert subject pronouns to object pronouns in relative clauses. Let's check the grammar rules.\n\nIn English, when a relative clause is the object of a preposition, the relative pronoun is usually \"which\" or \"that,\" but when it's the subject, it's \"who\" or \"that.\" If it's the object, it's \"whom.\" However, in modern English, \"whom\" is often replaced with \"who\" except in formal writing. But in the output, \"whom\" is used. So perhaps the instruction is to use \"whom\" in relative clauses, even though it's less common. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert \"I\" to \"me\" in certain contexts, but in the third example, it's \"whom.\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert \"I\" to \"me\" in all cases, but in the third example, the output uses \"whom.\" That doesn't align. So perhaps the third example is an exception, but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert \"I\" to \"whom\" whenever it follows a preposition. Wait, in the third example, \"I met\" is not following a preposition. The relative clause is \"I met [someone].\" So the subject of the relative clause is \"I,\" so \"who\" is correct. But the output uses \"whom,\" which is the object form. That seems like a mistake unless there's a different rule. Maybe the instruction is to always use \"whom\" in relative clauses<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, each input seems to have been transformed into a specific output. Let me look at them one by one and see if I can spot a pattern or common rule.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\nInput: Please call once you get there.\nOutput: Please call upon your arrival.\nSo here, \"once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival\". That sounds like replacing \"once you get there\" with a more formal phrase. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase informal expressions into more polite or standard English?\n\nLooking at the second input:\nInput: The whole story was made up.\nOutput: The entire story was fabricated.\nHere, \"whole\" becomes \"entire\", and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated\". So maybe the instruction is to replace certain words or phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents. But wait, \"whole\" and \"entire\" are similar but not exact synonyms. Maybe it's about specificity? Or perhaps the instruction is to convert informal terms to more formal ones.\n\nThird input:\nInput: This song is fire.\nOutput: This song is incredibly good.\nAh, here \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good\". So \"fire\" is slang meaning something is great, so the output uses a more descriptive phrase. So maybe the instruction is to translate slang or informal expressions into more standard or descriptive language.\n\nFourth input:\nInput: I can't stand his temper.\nOutput: I cannot tolerate his temper.\nHere, \"can't stand\" becomes \"cannot tolerate\". So replacing idiomatic expressions with more formal alternatives. That fits with the first example as well.\n\nFifth input:\nInput: I considered many approaches.\nOutput: Various approaches were considered.\nHere, \"considered many\" becomes \"various approaches were considered\". So \"many\" is replaced with \"various\", which is a synonym but perhaps more formal. Also, the structure changes from active voice to passive? Wait, no, the original is \"I considered many approaches\" (active), and the output is \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive). So maybe the instruction involves changing the sentence structure as well as vocabulary.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version, possibly using synonyms, more precise wording, and adjusting sentence structure where necessary. Let's check if that holds for all examples.\n\nFirst example: informal \"once you get there\" → formal \"upon your arrival\". Second: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Third: slang \"fire\" → descriptive \"incredibly good\". Fourth: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\". Fifth: \"considered many\" → \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice).\n\nAnother angle: maybe the instruction is to make the output more polite or professional. For instance, replacing contractions with full forms. But in the first example, \"Please call once...\" vs \"Please call upon...\", the contraction isn't present. Wait, the input doesn't use a contraction here. The first input is written in full sentences. So maybe it's about rephrasing rather than changing contractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal version by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal counterparts. Let's see:\n\n- \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (formal)\n- \"whole\" → \"entire\"\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\"\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (descriptive)\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal)\n- \"considered many\" → \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice)\n\nWait, the fifth example's output is passive voice, while the input is active. So maybe the instruction includes changing the voice as well. But how does that fit with the others? The first four examples don't change the voice. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms, more precise wording, and adjusting sentence structure when needed.\n\nBut why would the fifth example require changing the voice? Maybe the original instruction was to make the output more formal, which could involve various transformations depending on the context. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal version, which might include different transformations for each case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to replace certain words with their antonyms or opposites. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" – not an antonym. Second: \"whole\" → \"entire\" (same word?), \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (antonym of \"made up\"? Not exactly; \"fabricated\" means created falsely, whereas \"made up\" can mean composed of parts. Maybe not direct antonyms. Third: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" – not an antonym. Fourth: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" – similar meaning. Fifth: \"considered many\" → \"various approaches were considered\" – \"various\" is a synonym for \"many\", but the structure changes.\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly using synonyms, more precise wording, and adjusting sentence structure where appropriate. Let's see if that's consistent across all examples.\n\nFirst example: informal phrasing → formal. Second: \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\". Third: slang → descriptive. Fourth: informal expression → formal. Fifth: active voice → passive, \"considered many\" → \"various approaches were considered\".\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version, possibly using synonyms, more precise wording, and adjusting sentence structure as needed. But how to phrase that as an instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more polite or professional version, which could involve various transformations. For example, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, converting slang to standard terms, adjusting sentence structure, etc.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a common transformation. Let's list the outputs and see if they follow a pattern:\n\n1. Upon your arrival → formal\n2. Entire → same as whole?\n3. Fabricated → same as made up?\n4. Incredibly good → same as fire?\n5. Cannot tolerate → same as can't stand\n6. Various approaches were considered → considered many\n\nWait, the fifth example's output is passive voice, while the input is active. So maybe the instruction is to convert active to passive voice? But then why does the first example stay active? Because the input didn't use a verb that allows passive voice. For example, \"call\" can be passive (\"be called\"), but \"considered\" is passive already. Wait, the input is \"I considered many approaches\" (active), and the output is \"Various approaches were considered\" (passive). So maybe the instruction is to convert active to passive voice whenever possible. But not all inputs can be converted. For example, the first input is \"Please call once you get there.\" If we tried to make it passive, it would be \"You will be called once you get there,\" which is different. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which may involve various transformations like changing parts of speech, synonyms, sentence structure, etc., depending on the context.\n\nGiven that the user provided five input-output pairs, each requiring a different transformation, the instruction likely requires applying multiple types of rephrasing rules. However, the key commonality is that each output is a more formal or standardized version of the input. Therefore, the instruction might be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or standard version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and ensuring clarity.\"\n\nBut let's check if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents. Let's see:\n\n- \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (formal)\n- \"whole\" → \"entire\" (same word, but maybe more formal)\n- \"made up\" → \"fabricated\" (different meaning, but more formal)\n- \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (descriptive, not formal)\n- \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (formal)\n- \"considered many\" → \"various approaches were considered\" (passive, more formal)\n\nWait, the third example's output is not a synonym but a description. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more descriptive or formal terms. But \"fire\" is slang, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\" is a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a more polite or professional version, which could involve various transformations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by replacing certain words or phrases with their more formal counterparts, adjusting sentence structure, and ensuring clarity. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more precise adjectives, changing active to passive voice when appropriate, etc.\n\nBut given the examples, the most consistent pattern is that each output is a more formal version of the input, possibly using synonyms, more precise wording, and adjusting sentence structure. Therefore, the instruction likely was: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or standard version, using appropriate synonyms, adjusting sentence structure, and ensuring clarity.\"\n\nHowever, another possibility is that the instruction was to translate each input into a more<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"Please call once you get there.\" and the output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" So here, the phrase \"once you get there\" was replaced with \"upon your arrival\". That seems like a synonym substitution. \"Once\" can mean \"at the time when\", and \"arrival\" is the point of getting there. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nLooking at the second input-output pair: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" was replaced with \"entire\", and \"made up\" with \"fabricated\". Both are synonyms but perhaps more formal or specific terms. So maybe the instruction is to replace common words with their more formal or precise counterparts.\n\nThird input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" Again, replacing \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate\". These are synonyms. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" This is a bit more complex. The original statement is a negative opinion about doing something now. The output is a suggestion to not take action. So instead of expressing a personal opinion (\"we don't think\"), it's rephrased as a neutral suggestion. The structure changed from a direct statement to a conditional suggestion. Also, \"right now\" became \"at this stage\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, indirect suggestion, possibly changing the perspective from first person to third person, and altering the timing.\n\nFifth input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got what you said\" is colloquial, and the output uses a more formal verb \"understood\" along with the pronoun \"you\" instead of \"what you said\". So replacing idiomatic expressions with more direct statements.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction might involve transforming the input sentences into more formal, precise, or polite versions. Let's check each transformation again:\n\n1. Replace informal expressions (e.g., \"once you get there\") with their more formal or precise synonyms (e.g., \"upon your arrival\").\n2. Replace common words with their more formal or specific counterparts (e.g., \"whole\" → \"entire\", \"made up\" → \"fabricated\").\n3. Replace informal phrasal verbs (e.g., \"can't stand\") with their more formal equivalents (e.g., \"cannot tolerate\").\n4. Restructure the sentence to present a suggestion rather than a personal opinion, using passive voice or neutral phrasing (e.g., \"it is suggested that...\").\n5. Replace idiomatic expressions with more direct statements (e.g., \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\").\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, precise version, replacing informal expressions, common words with their more specific counterparts, restructuring sentences to present suggestions neutrally, and converting idiomatic expressions into direct statements.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using synonyms and restructuring where necessary. Another angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more polite or professional. For example, the first output starts with \"Please call upon your arrival,\" which is a bit more formal than the original. Similarly, the fourth output is a suggestion rather than a direct statement, which might be considered more polite in some contexts.\n\nWait, but why would the fourth input-output pair be a suggestion? The original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a suggestion. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal, indirect recommendation. For instance, turning a personal opinion into a neutral suggestion. That could be part of the instruction.\n\nAnother possible aspect is the use of \"It is suggested that...\" in the fourth output. That structure is often used in formal writing to present recommendations without sounding too assertive. So perhaps the instruction involved rephrasing the input into such a structure when appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the fifth input-output pair: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, the original is a colloquial way of saying \"I understood your message,\" and the output is a more direct statement. So replacing idiomatic expressions with more straightforward phrasing.\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction likely required the friend to transform each input into a more formal, precise, and polite version by:\n\n- Replacing informal expressions with their more formal equivalents.\n- Using more specific or precise vocabulary (e.g., replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\").\n- Restructuring sentences to present suggestions neutrally, especially when the original expresses an opinion.\n- Converting idiomatic expressions into more direct or standard phrasing.\n\nTherefore, the original instruction probably stated something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal, precise version by replacing informal expressions with their more appropriate synonyms, using more specific vocabulary, restructuring sentences to present suggestions neutrally when applicable, and converting idiomatic expressions into direct statements.\"\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction provided to the friend was to **rephrase each input into a more formal, precise, and polite version** by applying the following transformations:\n\n1. **Replace informal expressions with formal equivalents**:  \n   - Example: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (synonym substitution).  \n   - Example: \"can't stand\" → \"cannot tolerate\" (synonym replacement).\n\n2. **Use more specific or precise vocabulary**:  \n   - Example: \"whole\" → \"entire\"; \"made up\" → \"fabricated\".\n\n3. **Restructure sentences to present neutral suggestions**:  \n   - Example: \"We don’t think it’s a good idea...\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" (passive voice and recommendation phrasing).\n\n4. **Convert idiomatic expressions to direct statements**:  \n   - Example: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you\" (eliminating colloquial phrasing).\n\n**Final Instruction**:  \n\"Rewrite each input into a more formal, precise version by replacing informal expressions with appropriate synonyms, using specific vocabulary, restructuring sentences to present neutral suggestions when necessary, and converting idiomatic language into direct statements.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where their friend transformed each input into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n2. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n3. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n5. Input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" → Output: \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, I need to identify common linguistic patterns or structures that connect the inputs to the outputs. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a direct expression of gratitude (\"Thanks for your help.\"). The output rephrases it using \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\" So here, the subject is changed from \"you\" (implied) to \"your assistance,\" and the verb phrase is adjusted. Also, \"much appreciated\" adds emphasis.\n\nSecond input: The question \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the structure changes from a present ability (\"can\") to a hypothetical possibility (\"would be able to\"). The verb \"do\" is replaced with \"accomplish,\" which might be more formal or specific in context.\n\nThird input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\". The original uses \"can't tell the difference,\" which is a colloquial way of expressing difficulty. The output uses a more formal phrasing with \"find it hard to distinguish,\" maintaining the same meaning but altering the sentence structure.\n\nFourth input: The statement \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" turns into \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" This seems like a shift from a personal opinion to a more formal recommendation. The original is a negative opinion about doing anything now, while the output presents it as a suggestion against taking action, possibly in a more advisory tone.\n\nFifth input: \"I can't stand his temper.\" becomes \"I cannot tolerate his temper.\" The core meaning remains the same, but the verb is changed from \"stand\" to \"tolerate,\" which might be more neutral or formal. \"Can't stand\" is informal, whereas \"cannot tolerate\" is more formal.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's consider possible instruction types:\n\n1. **Rephrasing for Formality**: Some outputs seem more formal than the inputs. For example, changing \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard,\" or \"don't think\" to \"is suggested.\" But not all inputs are informal. The first input is already formal.\n\n2. **Changing Sentence Structure**: The second input changes \"can you do\" to \"would you be able to accomplish,\" altering the verb tense and structure. The fourth input changes \"We don't think\" to \"It is suggested,\" which is a different sentence structure altogether.\n\n3. **Replacing Idiomatic Expressions**: The fifth input replaces \"can't stand\" with \"cannot tolerate,\" which is a direct replacement of an idiom with a synonym.\n\n4. **Adjusting Tense or Modality**: The second input uses \"would be able to\" instead of \"can,\" which is a modal shift from possibility to hypothetical ability.\n\n5. **Rephrasing Opinions into Suggestions**: The fourth input transforms a personal opinion into a formal suggestion, which might be part of a larger context like a report or professional communication.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version, but some examples don't fit that. For instance, the third input is already formal. The fourth input is a significant change in structure and tone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into statements or vice versa. The second input is a question turned into a statement, but the first input is a statement. Not sure.\n\nWait, the second input is a question becoming a statement, but the first is a statement. So maybe not a general conversion between question and statement.\n\nLooking at the fourth input: The original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a suggestion. That could imply that the instruction was to rephrase opinions into recommendations or suggestions, especially in contexts like business or formal writing.\n\nBut the fifth input is just replacing an idiom with another similar expression. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with more formal alternatives, but only when applicable.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could have been to adjust the level of formality, but varying examples complicate that.\n\nLet me check the outputs again. The first output is more formal than the input. The second input's output is also more formal. The third input's output is slightly more formal. The fourth input's output is very formal. The fifth input's output is a synonym but not necessarily more formal.\n\nHmm. So maybe the instruction was to make the input more formal, but not all examples fit. Alternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more polite or professional version, but again, not all examples align.\n\nWait, the fourth input's output is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion, which might be part of a larger task like rewriting a paragraph into a more formal tone, or converting a personal opinion into a professional recommendation.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct statement. For example, the first input is direct gratitude, but the output is a bit more indirect. The second input's output is a softer way of asking. The fourth input's output is a suggestion rather than a direct statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more positive or less negative version. The fourth input's output is a suggestion to take no action, which is a positive outcome. The first input is positive. The fifth input's output is a synonym but doesn't change negativity.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more neutral or objective tone. For example, the first input's output is more neutral. The fourth input's output is a suggestion, which is objective.\n\nWait, the fourth input's output is \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" which is a neutral statement of a suggestion. The original was \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" which is a personal opinion. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase subjective opinions into objective suggestions or recommendations.\n\nThat could be a possibility. Let's see other examples:\n\n- First input: Gratitude becomes a statement of appreciation (still subjective but phrased differently).\n- Second input: A question becomes a statement of ability (still a request but phrased as a fact).\n- Third input: Difficulty becomes a statement of finding it hard (similar to the first).\n- Fifth input: An expression of inability to tolerate becomes a direct statement.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or objective statement, possibly turning subjective expressions into more neutral or professional phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct form. For example, the second input's output is a softer way of asking, which is less direct.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more positive or less negative version. The fourth input's output is a suggestion to take no action, which is a positive outcome. The first input is positive. The fifth input's output is a synonym but doesn't change negativity.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version, but again, not all examples fit.\n\nWait, looking at the fourth input's transformation: \"We don't think it's a good idea...\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken...\" This seems like a significant shift from a personal opinion to a formal recommendation. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional tone, especially in contexts where subjective opinions need to be converted into objective suggestions.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to rephrase each input into a more indirect or less direct form. For example, the second input's output is a softer way of asking, which is less direct.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more neutral or objective tone, removing any personal bias. For example, the fourth input's output is a neutral suggestion, whereas the original was a personal opinion.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use more formal language. For example, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" vs. \"Thanks for your help.\" The second output uses \"Would you be able to\" instead of \"Can you,\" which is a more formal way of asking. The third output uses \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference,\" which is more formal. The fourth output is entirely formal, using \"It is suggested...\" The fifth output uses \"cannot tolerate\" instead of \"can't stand,\" which is more formal.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or professional version, using more elevated language and avoiding contractions or informal expressions.\n\nBut then why does the first input's output use \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" which is still somewhat formal but not overly so? The original is already formal. Maybe the instruction was to make the input more<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples where each input was transformed into a specific output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to look for patterns or common transformations between the inputs and outputs. Let's list them out again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n3.

Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction is about rephrasing or converting certain types of statements into more formal or indirect language? Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: The input is a first-person statement expressing an opinion (\"I think...\"), and the output is a more formal, third-person phrasing (\"It is my opinion...\"). So perhaps the instruction is to convert first-person opinions into objective statements using \"it is my opinion\" structure.\n\nSecond input: The original is a negative statement in first person (\"We don't think...\"), and the output is a suggestion phrased as \"It is suggested that...\" So here, the instruction might involve turning negative first-person thoughts into positive suggestions. The original is a reason not to act, and the output is a suggestion to not act, but phrased more formally.\n\nThird input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject changes from \"I\" to \"Various,\" and the verb is adjusted. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the subject from first person to a more general or collective noun phrase.\n\nFourth input: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" Here, the first-person \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" and the object \"you\" is kept. So perhaps the instruction is to replace \"got\" with \"understood\" and adjust the sentence structure slightly.\n\nFifth input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" The original is a yes/no question asking capability, and the output is a more polite form using \"would be able to.\" So maybe the instruction involves converting questions about capability into more polite requests or statements using \"would be able to.\"\n\nNow, putting these together, the instruction might be something like: \"Convert the following statements into more formal or indirect expressions by rephrasing the subject, adjusting verb tenses, and using more polite or objective language.\"\n\nBut let's check if there's a common thread across all examples. For instance:\n\n- First example: Changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n- Second: Turning a negative first-person thought into a suggestion.\n- Third: Changing \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n- Fourth: Replacing \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n- Fifth: Converting \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\"\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use more formal or indirect language. For example, \"It is suggested\" instead of direct advice, \"Various approaches\" instead of \"I considered,\" etc.\n\nWait, looking at the third input: \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered.\" So the subject is changed from \"I\" to \"Various,\" which is a more general term. Similarly, the second input changes \"We don't think\" to \"It is suggested,\" which is a different structure.\n\nThe fourth input changes \"I got\" to \"I understood,\" which is a synonym but in past tense. The fifth input changes the question structure from \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite way of asking.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect version, possibly by changing the subject, adjusting verbs, and using more polite phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to convert first-person statements into third-person or more objective statements, especially when expressing opinions or considering actions.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The outputs often start with \"It is\" or \"It is suggested,\" which could indicate that the instruction is to frame the input as a statement of fact or a suggestion rather than a personal opinion or question.\n\nWait, the first output starts with \"It is my opinion,\" which is a bit redundant because \"my opinion\" already implies it's a statement of fact. But maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal structure, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" \"We don't think\" with \"It is suggested,\" etc.\n\nSimilarly, the second input's output uses \"It is suggested,\" which is a formal way to present a recommendation. The third input's output uses \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a more neutral phrasing than \"I considered.\"\n\nThe fourth input's output replaces \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is a synonym but in past tense. The fifth input's output changes the question into a more polite request using \"would be able to.\"\n\nSo combining all these observations, the instruction might be: \"Rephrase the given statement into a more formal or indirect expression by converting first-person opinions into objective statements, suggesting alternatives, adjusting verb tenses, and using polite phrasing.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific, like \"Convert each input into a more formal statement by replacing 'I think' with 'It is my opinion,' 'We don't think' with 'It is suggested,' and so on.\"\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if all the examples fit this instruction.\n\nFirst input: Yes, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n\nSecond input: \"We don't think\" becomes \"It is suggested,\" which fits the instruction of converting negative thoughts into suggestions.\n\nThird input: \"I considered\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered,\" which is a change in subject and verb structure.\n\nFourth input: \"I got\" becomes \"I understood,\" a synonym replacement.\n\nFifth input: \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" a more polite phrasing.\n\nYes, all examples seem to align with such an instruction. Therefore, the most likely instruction is to rephrase the input into a more formal or indirect version by making these kinds of transformations.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect expression** by applying the following transformations:\n1. **Convert first-person opinions into objective statements**: Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion.\"\n2. **Turn negative thoughts into constructive suggestions**: Replace \"We don't think\" with \"It is suggested.\"\n3. **Adjust subjects and verb structures**: Change \"I considered\" to \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n4. **Replace synonyms for clarity**: Substitute \"got\" with \"understood.\"\n5. **Politize questions**: Convert \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\" for politeness.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures the outputs are framed in a professional, indirect manner, aligning with the provided examples.\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each pair and see if there's a common pattern or transformation applied to the input to get the output.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"The whole story was made up.\" Output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So here, \"whole\" becomes \"entire,\" and \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" Maybe the instruction is to replace certain words with their synonyms or more formal equivalents? Let's check another example.\n\nSecond input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Here, \"I\" becomes \"whom.\" That's a grammatical change, replacing the subjective case with the objective case. Interesting. So maybe the instruction involves changing pronouns from subject to object form?\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\" The structure changes from a question using \"do you want\" to a suggestion using \"shall I...\" and changing the verb to \"accompany.\" So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase questions into suggestions or offers, altering both the structure and vocabulary?\n\nFourth input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original statement is transformed into a passive voice suggestion, replacing \"we don't think\" with \"it is suggested,\" and changing \"do anything\" to \"no action should be taken.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert statements expressing doubt or lack of ideas into formal suggestions in passive voice?\n\nFifth input: \"This song is fire.\" Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" The slang term \"fire\" is replaced with a more descriptive adjective. So perhaps the instruction is to translate informal expressions into more formal or standard phrasing?\n\nNow, looking for a common thread. Each output seems to be a more formal, polite, or structured version of the input. Let's break down each possible transformation:\n\n1. Word substitution (whole → entire, made up → fabricated)\n2. Pronoun case change (I → whom)\n3. Question to suggestion (Do you want... → Shall I...)\n4. Passive suggestion (We don't think... → It is suggested...)\n5. Slang to formal (fire → incredibly good)\n\nHmm. These transformations vary. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, but how do they all fit under one instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert each input into a different type of sentence structure. For example:\n\n- First input: Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n- Second: Change \"I\" to \"whom.\"\n- Third: Turn the question into a suggestion using \"shall I...\"\n- Fourth: Convert the statement into a passive suggestion.\n- Fifth: Replace slang with a more formal adjective.\n\nBut that seems too varied. Maybe there's a pattern where each output is a more formal or polite version, but the exact method varies per input. However, the user might have given a single instruction that covers all these cases. Let's think about possible instructions.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. **Formalize the sentence**: Make each input more formal. But how does that apply to all examples? The first example uses synonyms, the second changes pronouns, third turns a question into a suggestion, fourth uses \"suggested,\" fifth replaces slang. Formalizing might not cover all.\n\n2. **Polite rephrasing**: Maybe each output is a more polite way of saying the same thing. For instance, \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is more polite. Similarly, \"We don't think...\" becomes a suggestion, which is a polite way to express an opinion. The other examples also seem polite. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more polite or formal version.\n\n3. **Convert to passive voice**: The fourth example does that, but others don't. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Looking at the outputs, they often start with a more formal or polite phrase. For example, \"The entire story was fabricated\" is more formal than \"The whole story was made up.\" \"Shall I accompany you?\" is a polite offer. \"It is suggested...\" is formal. \"Incredibly good\" is more formal than \"fire.\"\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or structured version. But how to generalize this across all examples?\n\nWait, let's check the first example again. \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Both \"whole\" and \"made up\" are colloquial. Replacing them with \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" makes it more formal. Similarly, \"fire\" is slang, replaced with \"incredibly good.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace informal or colloquial expressions with more formal or standard terms.\n\nBut then why does the second example involve changing \"I\" to \"whom\"? That's a grammatical change rather than a vocabulary change. So perhaps the instruction is broader: rephrase each input into a more formal version, which can include various transformations like synonym replacement, grammatical changes, restructuring sentences, etc.\n\nLooking at the third example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a complete restructuring of the sentence into a suggestion, which is a more formal way to ask for help. Similarly, the fourth example converts the statement into a passive suggestion. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a formal suggestion or polite request.\n\nBut the first example doesn't fit that. Unless \"fabricated\" is considered a suggestion. Wait, \"fabricated\" means made up, so the output is just a synonym. So maybe the instruction is to replace informal words with their more formal counterparts, but in some cases, it's a grammatical change or sentence restructuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to convert each input into a more formal version by using more precise vocabulary, proper grammar, and polite phrasing. For example:\n\n- Replace informal words with synonyms (whole → entire, made up → fabricated).\n- Use correct pronoun cases (I → whom).\n- Restructure questions into polite offers (Do you want... → Shall I...).\n- Convert statements into passive suggestions (We don't think... → It is suggested...).\n- Replace slang with formal adjectives (fire → incredibly good).\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, and grammatically correct version, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures.\"\n\nBut the user might have given a specific instruction that encompasses all these transformations. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate each input into a different type of sentence, but that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a common element in all outputs. For example, the first output starts with \"The entire...\" which is a noun phrase. The second starts with \"The lawyer whom...\" The third starts with \"Shall I...\" The fourth with \"It is suggested...\" The fifth with \"This song is...\" So the outputs vary in structure. However, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a different type of sentence, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by using more precise language, proper grammar, and polite expressions. For example:\n\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\" (more precise).\n- Change \"I\" to \"whom\" (correct pronoun case).\n- Turn the question into a polite offer (\"Shall I...\").\n- Convert the statement into a passive suggestion (\"It is suggested...\").\n- Replace slang with a more formal adjective.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Maybe the original instruction was something like: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal and polite version, adjusting vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific, like converting questions into suggestions, but that would only apply to the third example. Since the instruction must cover all five examples, it's likely a general one.\n\nAnother angle: The outputs often use more formal or standardized expressions. For example, \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up,\" \"accompany\" instead of \"go with you,\" \"suggested\" instead of \"think it's a good idea,\" \"incredibly good\" instead of \"fire.\" So the instruction might be to replace informal or colloquial terms with their more formal equivalents, adjusting grammar and sentence structure where necessary.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible instruction is: \"Replace informal or colloquial expressions with their more formal equivalents, adjusting grammar and sentence structure as needed to produce a more polished version of the input.\"\n\nBut let's verify if this fits all examples:\n\n1. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Formal replacement of \"whole\" and \"made up\" with \"entire\" and \"fabricated.\"\n2. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" Changed \"I\" to \"whom\" (grammatical adjustment).\n3. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Rewrote the question into a polite offer.\n4. \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → \"It is suggested that no action should be taken<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction that would generate these outputs from the inputs. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the patterns between each input and output. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n4. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n5. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, I notice that each output seems to rephrase the input in a more formal or polite way. Let's break down each pair:\n\n1. The first input uses \"I think\" which is a first-person statement. The output changes it to \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So maybe the instruction is to convert first-person statements into third-person opinions or formal expressions.\n\n2. The second input uses \"can't tell the difference,\" which is a negative phrasing. The output replaces it with \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more neutral and perhaps more formal way of saying the same thing. So maybe the instruction involves rephrasing negative statements into less direct or more indirect expressions.\n\n3. The third input is a question asking if someone can do something. The output turns it into a question using \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite and indirect way of asking. So perhaps the instruction is to convert direct questions into more polite or indirect questions.\n\n4. The fourth input is a request to call when arriving. The output uses \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal or traditional phrasing. So maybe the instruction is to replace modern phrasing with more old-fashioned or formal terms.\n\n5. The fifth input is a casual greeting, \"See you tonight.\" The output becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight,\" which is a more formal and anticipatory response. So perhaps the instruction is to transform casual greetings into more formal or anticipatory statements.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Each output seems to be a more formal, polite, or indirect version of the input. Let's check each transformation again:\n\n1. From \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\": This changes the perspective from first-person to third-person, making it a statement of opinion rather than personal belief. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase first-person thoughts into third-person opinions or formal statements.\n\n2. From \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\": This replaces a negative (\"can't\") with a more neutral phrasing (\"find it hard\"), which is less direct. So perhaps the instruction is to rephrase negative statements into softer, more indirect expressions.\n\n3. From \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\": This converts a direct question into a more polite and indirect question, using \"would\" and \"able to\" instead of \"can.\" So the instruction might involve converting direct questions into more polite or indirect questions.\n\n4. From \"call once you get there\" to \"call upon your arrival\": Here, \"once you get there\" is replaced with \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal term. So the instruction could involve replacing modern phrasing with more traditional or formal terms.\n\n5. From \"See you tonight\" to \"look forward to meeting you\": This transforms a casual greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. So the instruction might involve converting casual greetings into more formal or anticipatory statements.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely requires transforming the input into a more formal, polite, or indirect version. Let's see if we can generalize this.\n\nPossible instruction candidates:\n\n- Convert first-person statements into third-person opinions.\n- Replace negative phrasing with softer alternatives.\n- Turn direct questions into more polite or indirect questions.\n- Replace modern phrasing with more formal or traditional terms.\n- Transform casual greetings into more formal or anticipatory statements.\n\nBut wait, looking at the first example, the input is a statement, not a question. The second example is a negative statement. The third is a question. The fourth is a request (imperative), and the fifth is a greeting. So the instruction must cover multiple types of input structures.\n\nAnother angle: Each output seems to be a more formal version. For instance, \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, \"can't tell\" becomes \"find it hard,\" which is less direct. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is more polite. \"Call once you get there\" becomes \"call upon your arrival,\" which is more formal. \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is more anticipatory.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal, polite, or indirect version of the original statement.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific, like \"Convert first-person statements into third-person opinions\" combined with other transformations. But since the examples include different types of inputs (statements, questions, requests, greetings), the instruction needs to cover multiple cases.\n\nWait, but the first example is a statement, the second a negative statement, the third a question, the fourth an imperative, and the fifth a greeting. So the instruction must handle various sentence types. Therefore, the instruction is likely a general one that applies to any input type, requiring the output to be a more formal, polite, or indirect version.\n\nBut let's check if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction is to \"politefy\" the input by making it more formal and indirect. Alternatively, it could be to \"rephrase into a more formal tone.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they often use \"it is my opinion,\" \"I find it hard,\" \"Would you be able to,\" \"upon your arrival,\" \"I look forward to.\" These phrases are all more formal or indirect. So the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and indirect version, using phrases like 'it is my opinion,' 'I find it hard to distinguish,' etc.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this as an instruction? The user probably gave a friend an instruction, which is a set of steps or guidelines to follow when processing the inputs. Since the outputs are all more formal versions, the instruction is likely to transform the input into a more formal, polite, or indirect statement.\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs often start with \"It is my opinion,\" \"I find it hard,\" \"Would you be able to,\" \"Please call upon,\" \"I look forward to.\" So the instruction might involve starting with \"It is my opinion\" for statements, using \"I find it hard\" for negatives, turning questions into \"Would you be able to...\" questions, replacing \"call once you get there\" with \"upon your arrival,\" and transforming greetings into anticipatory statements.\n\nBut to make this into a single instruction, perhaps the instruction is to \"politefy\" the input by rephrasing it into a more formal and indirect version, using appropriate phrases depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific, such as:\n\n- For statements: Convert \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion.\"\n- For negatives: Replace \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n- For questions: Change \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\"\n- For imperatives: Replace \"call once you get there\" with \"call upon your arrival.\"\n- For greetings: Turn \"See you\" into \"I look forward to meeting you.\"\n\nBut the instruction given to the friend would need to cover all these cases. However, the user mentioned that the instruction was a single instruction, not case-specific. So perhaps the instruction is more general, like \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate phrasing for each context.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Politefy each input by rephrasing it into a more formal and indirect version, using phrases like 'it is my opinion,' 'I find it hard to distinguish,' 'Would you be able to,' 'upon your arrival,' and 'I look forward to.'\"\n\nBut the key is that the instruction must encompass all the transformations observed. Let's check if there's a common element across all outputs. For example:\n\n- All outputs start with \"It is my opinion\" (first input), \"I find it hard\" (second), \"Would you be able to\" (third), \"Please call upon\" (fourth), \"I look forward to\" (fifth). These are all different openings but share the characteristic of being more formal or indirect.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"convert each input into a more formal and indirect version by replacing certain phrases with their formal equivalents.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this as a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal and polite version, using appropriate phrasing for each context.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be: \"Politefy each input by rephrasing it into a more formal and indirect version, using phrases like 'it is my opinion,' 'I find it hard to distinguish,' 'Would you be able to,' 'upon your arrival,' and 'I<|end_of_thought|> <|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction given to the friend was to **politefy** each input by rephrasing it into a more"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output examples, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the output. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n2. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n4. Input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nLooking at these, maybe the instruction involves transforming certain phrases or parts of speech. Let's break down each pair.\n\nStarting with the first example: \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" So perhaps replacing an adjective with a more descriptive phrase? But \"fire\" is a metaphor here, not a literal adjective. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase positive statements into more emphatic versions. For instance, \"good\" becomes \"incredibly good,\" which adds emphasis. Similarly, \"helpful\" in the second input becomes \"was helpful\" but with \"whom\" added. Wait, no—the second input's output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met.\" That seems like changing the pronoun from \"I\" to \"whom,\" but only in the past tense? Or maybe it's about making the sentence more formal or using different pronouns. Let's check the third input: \"Do you...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a change in the interrogative structure. Instead of using \"do\" and \"you,\" it uses \"shall\" and \"I.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert questions into suggestions or offers, changing the subject and verb form. \n\nFourth input: \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" Here, \"can\" is replaced with \"would be able to,\" which is a more polite or tentative way of asking. Fifth input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" becomes \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" So here, the negative \"can't\" is turned into a more neutral \"find it hard,\" and \"distinguish\" replaces \"tell the difference.\"\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might involve several transformations depending on the input type. Let's categorize the possible transformations:\n\n1. **Emphatic Rephrasing**: Like turning \"fire\" into \"incredibly good.\" Maybe when the input is a statement expressing approval or positivity, the output is a more emphatic version.\n2. **Pronoun Changes**: In the second input, \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met.\" That could be changing from \"I\" to \"whom\" (object pronoun) after a past participle. But why only in that case? Maybe it's about making the sentence more formal or using different pronoun cases.\n3. **Question to Suggestion/Offer**: Third input changes \"Do you...\" to \"Shall I...\" which is a shift from asking permission to offering to do something. This might involve converting questions into offers or suggestions, possibly changing the subject from \"you\" to \"I.\"\n4. **Polite Requests**: Fourth input turns \"Can you...\" into \"Would you be able to...\" which is a more polite way of asking for help.\n5. **Negative to Neutral**: Fifth input changes \"can't tell\" to \"find it hard,\" softening the negation.\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, adjusting sentence structure, pronouns, and vocabulary. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nFor the first input, \"This song is fire.\" The output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" This seems like adding emphasis (\"incredibly\") to make it more forceful. If the original was a statement of approval, the output is a more emphatic version. Similarly, \"helpful\" becomes \"was helpful\" but with \"whom\" added. Wait, the second input's output is \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\" So here, the structure is changed by inserting \"whom\" after \"met.\" That might be part of making the sentence more formal, perhaps using object pronouns where subject pronouns were used before a past participle. For example, \"I met the lawyer\" becomes \"the lawyer whom I met.\" So changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\" could be part of the instruction.\n\nThird input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a significant change in both structure and vocabulary. The question is transformed into a suggestion using \"Shall I...\" instead of \"Do you want me...\" So the instruction might include converting questions into offers or suggestions, changing the subject from \"you\" to \"I.\"\n\nFourth input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, \"can\" is replaced with \"be able to,\" and \"do\" is replaced with \"accomplish.\" Also, \"you\" remains \"you,\" but the overall tone becomes more polite (\"Would you be able to\" vs. \"Can you\").\n\nFifth input: \"I can't tell the difference...\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish...\" The negative \"can't\" is softened to \"find it hard,\" and \"distinguish\" replaces \"tell the difference.\"\n\nSo putting all these together, the instruction likely involves multiple transformations depending on the input's structure and context. The key elements seem to be:\n\n- Changing questions into offers or suggestions, often using \"Shall I...\" or \"Would you be able to...\"\n- Adding emphasis or formality to statements, such as replacing simple adjectives with more descriptive phrases.\n- Adjusting pronoun usage, especially after past participles (e.g., changing \"I met\" to \"whom I met\").\n- Softening negative expressions (like \"can't\" to \"find it hard\").\n\nBut how to formulate this into a single instruction? The user probably gave a set of instructions that cover these various cases. Let's think about possible instruction phrasing.\n\nPossible instruction options:\n\n1. **Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, adjusting sentence structure, pronouns, and vocabulary as needed.\n2. **Convert questions into offers or suggestions**, changing the subject from \"you\" to \"I\" and altering the verb form.\n3. **Add emphasis or formality to statements**, replacing simple adjectives with more descriptive phrases and using more formal language.\n4. **Adjust pronoun usage** in specific contexts, such as after past participles by inserting \"whom\" when appropriate.\n5. **Softening negative expressions** by replacing direct negatives with softer alternatives.\n\nBut the instruction is likely a single, comprehensive set of guidelines. Let's consider that the instruction might be to transform each input into a more formal or polite version, which includes several sub-transformations. For example, when a statement is given, make it more emphatic; when a question is asked, turn it into a suggestion; adjust pronouns where necessary, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they all seem to follow a pattern of increasing formality or politeness. For instance, \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is more polite. \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal offer. \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good,\" adding emphasis. \"I can't tell...\" becomes \"find it hard,\" softening the negativity.\n\nSo the instruction might be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, adjusting sentence structure, pronouns, and vocabulary as needed.\" However, this is quite broad. Alternatively, the instruction could specify particular transformations, like converting questions into offers, rephrasing positives with emphasis, adjusting pronouns, etc.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every input. So the instruction must have been specific enough to cover all these cases. Let's think of possible instruction wording.\n\nPossible instruction: \"For each input, rephrase it into a more formal or polite version. When a question is asked, convert it into a suggestion or offer using 'Shall I...' or 'Would you be able to...'. When a statement expresses approval, add emphasis. Adjust pronoun usage where necessary, such as changing 'I met' to 'whom I met' after a past participle. Soften negative expressions by replacing direct negatives with softer alternatives.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more concise, like: \"Polite and formal rephrasing: Convert questions into offers, add emphasis to statements, adjust pronouns, and soften negatives.\"\n\nBut the exact wording would depend on the instruction given. Since the user is asking us to reverse-engineer the instruction based on the examples, we need to find the common thread across all outputs.\n\nAnother approach: look for common transformations in each input-output pair.\n\n1. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\" Here, \"fire\" is replaced with \"incredibly good.\" So maybe replacing certain words with more descriptive phrases, especially when the input is a statement of approval.\n\n2. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where each input was transformed into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to determine the initial instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\n1. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n3. Input: \"Thanks for your help.\" → Output: \"Your assistance is much appreciated.\"\n4. Input: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n5. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n\nLooking at these transformations, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? Let's check each example.\n\nStarting with the first input: The original is a negative statement about not doing anything. The output is a suggestion phrased in the passive voice, using \"is suggested\" and \"no action should be taken.\" So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a polite suggestion, possibly using modal verbs like \"should\" or \"is suggested.\"\n\nSecond input: A question asking if the speaker should go along. The output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a more formal way to ask for permission. So perhaps the instruction was to convert questions into polite requests or suggestions, maybe using \"shall I\" instead of \"do you want me to.\"\n\nThird input: A simple thank you. The output expands it to \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a more formal or emphatic way of expressing gratitude. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase expressions of thanks into more formal or elaborate versions.\n\nFourth input: A statement about considering many approaches. The output changes \"considered\" to \"were considered\" and adds \"various\" before approaches. So here, the instruction might involve rephrasing the sentence structure, adding adjectives, or changing tenses.\n\nFifth input: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" Here, \"whole\" is replaced with \"entire,\" and \"was made up\" is changed to \"was fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction involved replacing certain words with their synonyms or more formal equivalents.\n\nPutting all these together, the instruction likely involves rephrasing the input into a more formal, polite, or structured version. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the transformation from the inputs to outputs, sometimes these exercises are about converting into a specific style, like passive voice, polite requests, or more formal language. For example, the second input's output uses \"Shall I accompany you?\" which is a polite way to ask for permission, whereas the original is a direct question. Similarly, the third input's output is a more formal expression of gratitude.\n\nThe fourth input's output adds \"various\" and changes the verb tense from past simple to past perfect passive. The fifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and changes the verb phrase.\n\nSo possible instruction could be: \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using passive voice, modal verbs, or more formal vocabulary.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure as the outputs. For example, the outputs often start with a subject followed by a verb phrase, sometimes using \"is suggested,\" \"shall I,\" etc. The inputs vary in structure, but the outputs seem to follow a certain pattern.\n\nWait, another thought: the outputs often use \"is suggested\" (for the first input), \"shall I\" (second), \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" (third), \"Various approaches were considered\" (fourth), \"The entire story was fabricated\" (fifth). So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a similar structure, possibly using different parts of speech or sentence patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, using more elevated vocabulary or grammatical structures. For example, replacing contractions (\"don't\" with \"is not\"), changing \"do you want\" to \"shall I,\" expanding abbreviations (\"your help\" to \"Your assistance\"), etc.\n\nLet me check each input-output pair again for possible patterns:\n\n1. Original: Negative statement → Output: Suggestion in passive voice.\n2. Question → Output: Polite request starting with \"Shall I.\"\n3. Gratitude → Output: Formal expression of thanks.\n4. Statement about considering approaches → Output: Passive voice with \"various\" added.\n5. Statement about being made up → Output: Passive voice with \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up.\"\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using passive voice, modal verbs, or more formal vocabulary. Alternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a similar structure as the outputs, such as starting with a subject and a verb phrase, using certain phrases like \"is suggested,\" \"shall I,\" etc.\n\nAnother approach: look for common transformations. For example, \"do you want me to\" becomes \"shall I,\" which is a more formal way to ask for permission. \"Thanks for your help\" becomes \"Your assistance is much appreciated,\" which is a more formal and emphatic way of thanking someone. \"I considered many approaches\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered,\" which adds \"various\" and changes the structure. \"The whole story was made up\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated,\" replacing \"whole\" with \"entire\" and changing the verb phrase.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using different vocabulary, restructuring sentences, or employing certain phrases like \"is suggested,\" \"shall I,\" etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a similar structure as the outputs, such as using \"is suggested\" for suggestions, \"shall I\" for offers, etc. But how would that apply to all inputs?\n\nWait, the first input is a statement, the second is a question, the third is a gratitude, the fourth is a statement about considering, the fifth is a statement about being made up. Each input type is transformed differently. So the instruction must cover various cases.\n\nPerhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure as the outputs, regardless of the original input type. For example:\n\n- If the input is a statement, rephrase it into a suggestion using passive voice.\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it into a polite offer using \"Shall I.\"\n- If the input is a gratitude, rephrase it into a more formal expression of thanks.\n- If the input is about considering approaches, rephrase it into a passive voice statement with \"various.\"\n- If the input is about something being made up, rephrase it into a passive voice statement with \"fabricated.\"\n\nBut that seems too specific. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure as the outputs, which often start with a subject followed by a verb phrase, sometimes using \"is suggested,\" \"shall I,\" etc. So the general instruction could be: \"Rephrase each input into a similar structure as shown in the examples, using appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might have been to convert the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using different parts of speech, sentence patterns, or specific phrases. For example, replacing contractions, changing question tags to polite requests, expanding abbreviations, etc.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they often use more formal language. For instance, \"Your assistance is much appreciated\" vs. \"Thanks for your help.\" The second is more formal. Similarly, \"Shall I accompany you?\" is a more formal way to ask for permission than \"Do you want me to go with you?\" So maybe the instruction was to convert informal expressions into more formal ones, possibly using different sentence structures.\n\nAdditionally, the fourth input's output adds \"various\" and changes the verb tense. The fifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and changes the verb phrase. So maybe the instruction involved rephrasing the input by adding descriptive words, changing parts of speech, or adjusting the sentence structure.\n\nPutting all this together, the most plausible instruction is: \"Rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using passive voice, modal verbs, or more formal vocabulary.\" This covers the various transformations observed in the examples. For instance:\n\n- The first input becomes a passive suggestion.\n- The second input becomes a polite offer using \"Shall I.\"\n- The third input is expanded into a more formal expression of gratitude.\n- The fourth input uses passive voice and adds \"various.\"\n- The fifth input replaces \"whole\" with \"entire\" and changes the verb phrase.\n\nTherefore, the instruction was likely to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly using different grammatical structures, vocabulary, or sentence patterns as demonstrated in the examples.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version**, utilizing specific grammatical structures and vocabulary as exemplified in the output pairs. Key transformations included:\n\n1. **Passive Voice & Suggestions**: Convert statements into polite recommendations (e.g., \"It is suggested that...\" for \"We don't think...\").\n2. **Polite Requests**: Replace direct questions with formal offers (e.g.,"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each input was transformed into an output. My job is to reverse-engineer the instruction based on these examples. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if there's a pattern or common transformation applied.\n\n1. Input: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n2. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n3. Input: \"She looks like her sister.\" → Output: \"She resembles her sister.\"\n4. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n5. Input: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nLooking at these, I notice that each output seems to rephrase the input in a more formal or slightly different way. Let's break down each pair:\n\n1. The first input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more polite response. The original uses \"see you\" which is informal, replaced with \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is more formal and positive.\n\n2. The second input uses \"can't tell the difference,\" which is a negative way of saying they can't distinguish. The output uses \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more neutral phrasing but still conveys the same meaning.\n\n3. The third input uses \"looks like,\" which is a direct comparison. The output uses \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but perhaps more formal or precise.\n\n4. The fourth input is a statement expressing hesitation about taking action. The output turns it into a suggestion not to take any action, using \"it is suggested\" which is a more formal way of advising against action.\n\n5. The fifth input is a colloquial expression \"got what you said,\" which is a way of confirming understanding. The output uses \"understood you,\" which is a more straightforward confirmation.\n\nSo, looking for a common thread here. All outputs seem to be rephrasing the input in a more formal or slightly more positive/negative way. Let's check each transformation:\n\n- For the first example, the original is informal, the output is formal and positive.\n- Second example: same structure but replacing \"can't tell\" with \"find it hard to distinguish.\"\n- Third example: same structure but replacing \"looks like\" with \"resembles.\"\n- Fourth example: changing the perspective from \"don't think it's a good idea\" to \"suggested that no action should be taken.\"\n- Fifth example: changing \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly making it more positive or suggesting an alternative. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or professional tone.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the fourth example: the input is a statement of not thinking it's a good idea, and the output is a suggestion not to take action. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a recommendation or suggestion, especially when the original expresses hesitation.\n\nBut let's see other examples. The first example is a greeting turned into a positive response. The second example is a negative phrasing turned into a neutral one. The third is a direct comparison. The fourth is a hesitation turned into a suggestion. The fifth is a colloquial confirmation turned into a direct understanding.\n\nHmm. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or professional tone, possibly making it more positive or suggesting an alternative. Alternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or less direct form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to convert the input into a more positive or encouraging statement. For example, the first input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more positive and formal response. The fourth input's output is a suggestion, which could be seen as a positive encouragement not to act rashly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, replacing contractions and informal expressions with their more formal equivalents. Let's check:\n\nIn the first example, \"See you\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you.\" Here, \"see you\" is a contraction, replaced with a full sentence. Similarly, \"I can't tell\" becomes \"I find it hard,\" which replaces the contraction with a more formal phrase. \"She looks like\" becomes \"She resembles,\" which is a synonym but more formal. \"We don't think\" becomes \"It is suggested,\" which is a more formal way of presenting a suggestion. \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct confirmation.\n\nSo, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, replacing contractions, informal expressions, and using more formal vocabulary. But why would the fourth example change the structure from \"We don't think...\" to \"It is suggested...\"? That seems like a different transformation. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or encouraging tone, especially when the original expresses hesitation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more polite or professional form, possibly by converting statements into suggestions or recommendations. For example, the fourth input's output is a suggestion, which might be part of a larger instruction to rephrase into recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the fifth example: \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you.\" This is a direct replacement of \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is a synonym but more formal. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms, especially in the context of confirming understanding.\n\nBut then why does the fourth example turn into a suggestion? That seems like a different transformation. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or encouraging statement. For example, the first input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more positive and formal response. The fourth input's output is a suggestion not to act, which could be seen as a positive advice. The fifth input's output is a direct confirmation, which is positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, replacing contractions and informal expressions. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n\nHere, \"can't tell\" is replaced with \"find it hard to distinguish,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Similarly, \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"She resembles her sister,\" which is a synonym but more formal. \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now\" becomes \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\" Here, the original is a statement of opinion, and the output is a suggestion, which is a more formal way of advising against action. \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct confirmation.\n\nSo, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly by replacing contractions, informal expressions, and using more formal vocabulary. Additionally, in some cases, the instruction might have been to convert statements into suggestions or recommendations, especially when the original expresses hesitation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more positive or encouraging tone. For example, the first input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more positive and formal response. The fourth input's output is a suggestion, which could be seen as a positive encouragement not to act rashly.\n\nBut how to reconcile the fourth example's transformation? The original is a statement of not thinking it's a good idea, and the output is a suggestion. That seems like a different kind of transformation. Perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or encouraging statement, even if it requires restructuring the sentence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, possibly by converting the input into a suggestion or recommendation when appropriate. For example, when the input expresses hesitation (\"We don't think...\"), the output is a suggestion not to take action. When the input is a statement of fact (\"She looks like her sister\"), the output is a synonym. When the input is a negative phrasing (\"I can't tell the difference\"), the output is a neutral phrasing. And when the input is a colloquial expression (\"I got what you said\"), the output is a more direct confirmation.\n\nThis suggests that the instruction might have been to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly by replacing contractions, informal expressions, and using more formal vocabulary, and in some cases, converting statements into suggestions or recommendations when the original expresses hesitation.\n\nAnother possible angle: looking at the outputs, many of them use \"I\" instead of the original subject. For example, the first output starts with \"I look forward,\" while the input was \"See you.\" The second output starts with \"I find,\" while the input was \"I can't tell.\" The third output starts with \"She resembles,\" same as input. The fourth output starts with \"It is suggested,\" whereas the input was \"We don't think...\" The fifth output starts with \"I understood,\" same as input.\n\nSo in some cases, the subject changes (like from \"We\" to \"It is suggested\"), but others remain the same. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, possibly by changing the subject or using more formal language, but not<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs where each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input. My job is to determine the common rule or transformation that the friend applied to each input to get the corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if there's a pattern.\n\nInputs:\n1. Can you do all these tasks?\n2. See you tonight.\n3. I got what you said.\n4. I think that this is interesting.\n5. Do you want me to go with you?\n\nOutputs:\n1. Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\n2. I look forward to meeting you tonight.\n3. I understood you.\n4. It is my opinion that this is interesting.\n5. Shall I accompany you?\n\nHmm. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nStarting with the first input-output pair. The input is a question asking if the friend can do certain tasks. The output is a rephrased question using \"Would you be able to...\" instead of \"Can you...\". So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version? But wait, the second input is a casual greeting, and the output is a more formal response. Third input is a statement of understanding, output is another way of saying the same thing. Fourth input is a personal opinion, output is phrased as \"It is my opinion that...\" which sounds more formal. Fifth input is a request for accompaniment, output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a polite way to ask for permission.\n\nSo looking at all these transformations, they seem to involve making the sentence more formal, polite, or changing the structure. Let's break down each transformation:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" → \"Would you be able to...\"\n   - Both are questions, but the second is more polite and uses \"be able to\" which implies capability.\n\n2. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n   - The original is a casual expression, the output is a more formal way of expressing anticipation.\n\n3. \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\"\n   - The original is a concise statement, the output is a more direct rephrasing.\n\n4. \"I think that this is interesting.\" → \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n   - The output uses \"my opinion\" to frame the speaker's thoughts, making it more formal.\n\n5. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - The original is a request phrased as a question, the output uses \"Shall I...\" which is a polite way to ask for permission.\n\nSo the common thread here is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. However, looking closer, some transformations are more about changing the structure rather than just formality. For example, the third input becomes a different sentence structure entirely. Similarly, the fourth input changes \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion,\" which is a different phrasing but still conveys the same meaning.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more indirect or less direct statement. For instance, the first input is a direct question, output is a slightly more indirect question. The second input is a direct statement, output is a more indirect expression of looking forward. The third input is a direct statement of understanding, output is a direct rephrasing. The fourth input is a direct opinion, output is a more formalized opinion. The fifth input is a direct request, output is a polite request.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to transform each input into a more formal or indirect version by replacing certain phrases. For example, replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to,\" \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you,\" \"got what you said\" with \"understood you,\" \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion,\" and \"do you want me to\" with \"shall I accompany you.\"\n\nWait, but the fifth input's output uses \"accompany\" instead of \"go with you.\" So maybe the instruction involved replacing certain verbs or phrases with more formal alternatives. Let's check:\n\nOriginal: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n\nHere, \"go with\" is replaced with \"accompany,\" which is a more formal term. Similarly, \"See you\" becomes \"look forward to meeting you,\" which is a more formal expression. \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood you,\" which is a slight change in phrasing. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which adds \"able to\" and \"would\" for politeness. \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which shifts the subject from \"I\" to \"it is my opinion,\" making it more formal.\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, possibly by replacing certain phrases with their more formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure, and using more indirect or polite language.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis against all examples. For example, the third input: \"I got what you said.\" The output is \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" which is a synonym but more formal. The structure changes from \"I [verb] what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct statement. So the transformation here is both changing the verb and restructuring the sentence.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the entire clause is rephrased to use \"my opinion\" instead of \"I think,\" which is a more formal way of expressing personal belief.\n\nThe fifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, \"want me to go with you\" is transformed into \"shall I accompany you,\" replacing \"go with\" with \"accompany\" and changing the structure from a question about desire to a polite request.\n\nSo the instruction likely required converting each input into a more formal, polite, or indirect version, possibly by replacing certain phrases, adjusting sentence structure, and using more formal language.\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs seem to be more indirect or less direct. For example, the first input is a direct question, output is a slightly more indirect question. The second input is a direct statement, output is a more indirect expression of anticipation. The third input is a direct statement, output is a direct rephrasing. The fourth input is a direct opinion, output is a more formalized opinion. The fifth input is a direct request, output is a polite request.\n\nSo the key difference is that the outputs are either more formal, more indirect, or both. Therefore, the instruction could have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version, maintaining the original meaning but altering the structure and tone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a question. But looking at the outputs, not all are questions. The second output is a statement, the third is a statement, the fourth is a statement, the fifth is a question. Wait, no—the fifth input is a question, and the output is also a question. So that doesn't fit. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite version. For example, replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to,\" \"do you want\" with \"shall I,\" etc. But let's check:\n\nInput 1: \"Can you...\" → Output: \"Would you be able to...\" (polite)\nInput 5: \"Do you want...\" → Output: \"Shall I...\" (polite)\n\nBut the other inputs don't fit this pattern. For example, input 2: \"See you tonight\" → output is a statement, not a question. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more formal version by replacing contractions and using more formal language. For example, \"I got\" becomes \"I understood,\" \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion,\" \"Do you want\" becomes \"Shall I.\"\n\nLooking at the third input: \"I got what you said.\" Output: \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood,\" which is a synonym but more formal. The structure changes from \"I [verb] what you said\" to \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct statement.\n\nSimilarly, \"I think that...\" becomes \"It is my opinion that...\" which shifts the subject from \"I\" to \"it is my opinion,\" making it more formal.\n\nIn the fifth input, \"Do you want me to...\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Here, \"want me to\" is replaced with \"shall I,\" and \"go with you\" is replaced with \"accompany you,\" which is a more formal term.\n\nSo the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or indirect version by replacing certain phrases, adjusting sentence structure, and using more formal language.\n\nAnother possible angle: The outputs seem to be more indirect or less direct. For example, the first input is a direct question, output is a slightly more indirect question. The second input is a direct statement, output is a more indirect expression of anticipation. The third input is a direct statement, output is a direct rephrasing. The fourth input is a direct opinion, output is a more formalized opinion. The fifth input is<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

The user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to determine the common rule or transformation that maps each input to its corresponding output. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\"\nOutput: \"I understood you.\"\nHmm, so here the output seems to rephrase the input. The original sentence uses \"got\" which might mean \"understood\" in this context. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input into a more standard form, replacing informal expressions with their standard equivalents. For example, \"got what you said\" becomes \"understood you.\"\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\"\nOutput: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nThis looks like a change in verb tense and structure. The original is a present tense question asking ability, and the output is a conditional question using \"would be able to.\" So perhaps the instruction is to convert questions about ability into conditional structures using \"be able to\" or similar phrasing.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nOutput: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\nHere, the output changes \"I met\" to \"whom I met,\" introducing a relative pronoun. So maybe the instruction involves modifying relative clauses by replacing possessive pronouns with relative pronouns (like \"who\" or \"whom\") when appropriate.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\"\nOutput: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\nThis transformation replaces \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So the instruction might involve converting first-person thoughts or opinions into a more formal or indirect statement structure.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\"\nOutput: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the output generalizes \"many approaches\" to \"various approaches\" and changes the subject-verb order from active to passive. So the instruction might require restructuring sentences into passive voice or using more general terms.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, what's the common thread? Each output seems to be a rephrased version of the input, but with specific linguistic changes. Let's see if there's a pattern across all examples.\n\n1. Rephrasing informal expressions to standard ones (e.g., \"got\" → \"understood\").\n2. Changing question structure from present to conditional with \"be able to\" (e.g., \"can you...\" → \"would you be able to...\").\n3. Modifying relative clauses by adding \"whom\" (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n4. Converting first-person thoughts into formal statements (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\").\n5. Restructuring active voice to passive (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n\nWait, but how do these all fit under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version, applying different transformations depending on the context. However, the user mentioned that the friend read the instruction and applied it to each input. So perhaps the instruction was something like \"Rephrase each sentence into a more formal or standardized version, making necessary grammatical adjustments as needed.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was more specific, like \"Convert questions about ability into conditional structures using 'be able to',\" but then the other transformations don't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to apply multiple transformations based on certain criteria. But given that each input-output pair has a different transformation, it's possible that the instruction was a set of rules or a combination of them. However, the user probably expects a single instruction that encompasses all these changes.\n\nAnother angle: looking for common elements in all outputs. For example, the outputs often use more formal language (e.g., \"understood\" instead of \"got\"), more complex sentence structures (like the conditional in the second example), or passive voice (fifth example). The third example adds a relative pronoun. The fourth example changes the subject to \"it\" and uses \"my opinion.\" \n\nBut how to combine all these into a single instruction? Perhaps the instruction was to \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, adjusting verb tenses, sentence structures, and vocabulary as needed.\" That would cover all the observed transformations. For instance:\n\n- \"Got what you said\" becomes \"understood\" (formal verb).\n- \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" (conditional structure).\n- \"I met\" becomes \"whom I met\" (relative clause adjustment).\n- \"I think\" becomes \"It is my opinion\" (formalizing the speaker's thought).\n- \"I considered\" becomes passive \"were considered\" (passive voice).\n\nSo the instruction likely instructed the friend to rephrase each input into a more formal version, possibly involving various grammatical and stylistic adjustments. The key here is that the instruction was broad enough to cover multiple types of transformations, each tailored to the input's context.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nThe instruction was to **rephrase each input into a more formal or standardized version**, applying necessary grammatical adjustments such as:\n\n1. **Replacing informal expressions** (e.g., \"got\" → \"understood\").\n2. **Modifying questions** about ability into conditional structures (e.g., \"can you...\" → \"would you be able to...\").\n3. **Enhancing relative clauses** by introducing relative pronouns (e.g., \"I met\" → \"whom I met\").\n4. **Converting first-person thoughts** into formal statements (e.g., \"I think\" → \"It is my opinion\").\n5. **Using passive voice** or generalizing terms (e.g., \"I considered\" → \"Various approaches were considered\").\n\n**Final Instruction:**  \n\"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal style, adjusting verb tenses, sentence structures, and vocabulary as needed.\"\n\n<|end_of_solution|><|endoftext|>"

Let me check each pair again.\n\nFirst input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" So here, the question is changed from present tense (\"do\") to past tense (\"be able to accomplish\"), and the phrasing is more formal. The second input: \"I think that this is interesting.\" becomes \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\" Here, the first-person perspective is replaced with a more formal \"it is my opinion\". Third input: \"The whole story was made up.\" becomes \"The entire story was fabricated.\" So \"whole\" vs. \"entire\", and \"made up\" vs. \"fabricated\"—both are synonyms but more formal. Fourth input: \"See you tonight.\" becomes \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This changes the informal greeting into a more formal expression of anticipation. Fifth input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"Shall I accompany you?\" Again, changing the question structure and using more formal terms like \"accompany\" instead of \"go with\".\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Alternatively, maybe it's about converting questions into statements or changing tenses. Wait, but not all outputs are just formalizing. For example, the third input is a synonym substitution without changing formality. The fourth input changes the greeting into a more formal expression. The fifth input changes the question structure and uses a more formal verb (\"accompany\" vs. \"want me to go\"). \n\nLooking at the outputs, some are more about politeness (like \"Shall I accompany you?\" instead of \"Do you want...\"), others are about formality (changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\"), and some are about rephrasing questions into statements or different structures. But the common thread seems to be that the outputs are more formal or polite versions of the inputs. However, the third input's output is a synonym but not necessarily more formal. Wait, \"fabricated\" is a synonym for \"made up\" but perhaps more formal. So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their more formal equivalents while maintaining the meaning. But then why does the second input change \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\"? That's a structural change rather than just a word replacement. Similarly, the fourth input changes \"See you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\", which is a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert each input into a more polite or formal version, possibly involving changing the sentence structure, replacing contractions, or using more formal language. Let's see:\n\n- First input: Change \"can you\" to \"would you be able to accomplish\", which is more formal and uses \"be able to\" instead of \"can\".\n- Second input: Replace \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", which is a more formal way of expressing personal belief.\n- Third input: Synonym substitution with \"entire\" and \"fabricated\" as more formal terms.\n- Fourth input: Change the informal greeting \"See you\" into a more formal expression of anticipation.\n- Fifth input: Change the question \"Do you want...\" into \"Shall I...\", which is a more formal way of asking for permission or assistance.\n\nSo combining all these, the instruction could be something like \"Rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polite manner, possibly by restructuring the sentence, replacing contractions, or using more formal vocabulary.\" Alternatively, it might specifically ask to convert questions into statements or use more polite phrasing. But looking at the outputs, the second and fifth examples involve changing the sentence structure entirely (from first-person statements to third-person statements, and from questions to statements). The first example changes \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\", which is a more formal structure. The third example is a synonym substitution. The fourth example changes the greeting into a more formal expression. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve various transformations depending on the context.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, some are more about politeness (e.g., \"Shall I accompany you?\"), others about formality (e.g., \"fabricated\" instead of \"made up\"). The second input's output is a structural change from first-person to third-person. The fourth input's output is a complete rephrasing of the greeting. So maybe the instruction was to make the sentences more polite or formal, which can include various methods like changing the subject, using more formal language, or restructuring the sentence.\n\nBut how to formulate the instruction that would lead to all these outputs? Let's consider possible instructions:\n\n1. \"Convert each input into a more formal or polite version.\"\n2. \"Rearrange each sentence into a more polite or formal structure.\"\n3. \"Rephrase each input using more formal language, including synonyms and sentence structure changes.\"\n4. \"Polite your responses by using more formal expressions.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements or use more formal phrasing. For example, the first input is a question, and the output is a statement. The fifth input is a question, and the output is a statement. The second input is a statement, and the output is a statement. The fourth input is a greeting, and the output is a statement. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, regardless of the original type. But the third input's output is a synonym, not a statement. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, the third input's output is \"The entire story was fabricated.\" which is a synonym but still a statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, possibly using synonyms. But the second input's output is a structural change from first-person to third-person. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve various transformations like changing subject, using more formal language, or rephrasing.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the outputs often start with \"Would you be able to...\" or \"It is my opinion...\", maybe the instruction was to turn questions into statements or use more formal expressions. But the first input is a question, and the output is a statement. The fifth input is a question, and the output is a statement. The second input is a statement, and the output is a statement. The fourth input is a greeting, and the output is a statement. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal statement, which could involve changing the subject, using more formal language, or rephrasing.\n\nBut the third input's output is a synonym, not a statement. So maybe the instruction was broader: to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could include various transformations. For example, changing \"made up\" to \"fabricated\" (formal), changing \"I think\" to \"It is my opinion\" (more formal), changing \"can you\" to \"would you be able to\" (more formal), changing \"see you\" to \"look forward to meeting you\" (more formal), and changing \"do you want...\" to \"shall I...\" (more formal).\n\nSo putting this together, the instruction likely was something like: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language and structure.\" Alternatively, it could be more specific, such as \"Convert each question into a statement using more formal phrasing,\" but that doesn't account for all the examples. Another possibility is that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, which could involve various methods like synonym substitution, changing sentence structure, or using more formal language.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, some are more about changing the subject (e.g., \"It is my opinion\" instead of \"I think\"), others are about changing the verb form (e.g., \"be able to\" instead of \"can\"), and others are about rephrasing greetings. So the instruction might have been to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, which could involve any combination of these techniques.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, the second input's output starts with \"It is my opinion\", which is a common way to express a personal belief in a more formal tone. The fifth input's output is a question turned into a statement using \"Shall I...\", which is a polite way to offer help. The first input's output uses \"Would you be able to\", which is a more formal way of asking if someone can do something. The fourth input's output is a greeting transformed into a statement of anticipation. The third input's output is a synonym substitution with more formal terms.\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rewrite each input into a more formal or polite version, using appropriate language and structure.\" This would encompass all the transformations observed. Alternatively, the instruction might have been more specific, like \"Convert each question into a statement using more formal phrasing,\" but that doesn't explain the other examples. For instance, the second input is a statement, and the output is also a statement but more formal. The third input is a statement, and the output is a synonym. The<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five input-output pairs, and we need to deduce the general rule or transformation applied here. Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nSo, the original question is in the form of a request or suggestion. The output seems to rephrase it using different phrasing but maintaining the same meaning. The key here might be changing the structure from a question asking permission to a more formal or polite request. For example, \"Do you want...\" becomes \"Shall I...\", which is a common way to ask for permission or to offer assistance politely.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"The whole story was made up.\" → Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\nHere, the output is a direct translation of the words into their synonyms. \"Whole\" becomes \"entire,\" \"made up\" becomes \"fabricated.\" So maybe the instruction was to replace certain words with their synonyms while keeping the sentence structure intact.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nAgain, the structure changes. The original uses \"can\" (ability), and the output uses \"would be able to\" (conditional possibility). Also, \"do all these tasks\" becomes \"accomplish all these tasks.\" So perhaps the instruction involves rephrasing the question into a more formal or polite version, possibly using different verb forms and synonyms.\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\nHere, the subject-verb inversion happens. The original is in present perfect (\"I considered\"), and the output is passive voice (\"were considered\"). Also, \"many approaches\" becomes \"various approaches.\" So maybe the instruction was to convert the sentence into passive voice and use more formal adjectives like \"various\" instead of \"many.\"\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\nThis seems like a simplification. The original is a statement that the speaker comprehended the listener's message. The output is a more direct expression of understanding. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the sentence into a more concise or direct statement about comprehension.\n\nNow, putting all these transformations together, there might be multiple possible instructions. Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the first pair, the structure changed from a question to a polite request. The second pair was word-for-word synonym replacement. Third pair involved changing \"can\" to \"would be able to\" and changing \"do\" to \"accomplish.\" Fourth pair converted active to passive voice and replaced \"many\" with \"various.\" Fifth pair simplified \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n\nWait, but how can there be a single instruction that covers all these? Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms where possible, adjusting sentence structures, and ensuring clarity. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal register, replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to perform a series of transformations: for example, converting questions into polite requests, replacing certain words with synonyms, changing sentence structures, etc. But the fifth example doesn't fit into that pattern. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the fifth input is a statement, and the output is another statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more concise or direct statement about understanding. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, using different vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal adjectives, changing tenses, etc.\n\nLet me think of possible instructions. For example:\n\n1. Convert each input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms and adjusting sentence structure.\n2. Replace each input with its synonym-based translation.\n3. Rephrase each input into a more concise or direct statement.\n4. Convert questions into polite requests, statements into affirmations, etc.\n\nBut the fifth example doesn't fit into the first three. Let's look at the fifth input-output again:\n\nInput: \"I got what you said.\" → Output: \"I understood you.\"\n\nThis could be a case of rephrasing \"got\" as \"understood\" and removing \"what you said\" because it's redundant. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more direct statement about comprehension, omitting unnecessary parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, using different vocabulary. For example, \"got\" becomes \"understood,\" \"what you said\" is omitted because it's implied.\n\nBut then why does the third input-output pair involve changing \"can you do\" to \"would you be able to\"? That's a different kind of transformation. So maybe the instruction isn't uniform across all cases. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to perform a specific set of operations depending on the type of input. For example:\n\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it as a polite request.\n- If it's a statement, rephrase it into a more formal version.\n- If it's a claim, translate it into a synonym-based version.\n\nBut the fifth input is a statement, and the output is another statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more concise or direct statement about understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version, using different vocabulary and sentence structures. For example:\n\n- Replace \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany you\" (polite request).\n- Replace \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated\" (synonym).\n- Replace \"can you do\" with \"would you be able to accomplish\" (more formal possibility).\n- Replace \"considered many approaches\" with \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice, more formal adjective).\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\" (more direct).\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. The fourth example changes active to passive, but others don't. The third example changes \"can\" to \"would be able to\". The fifth example omits \"what you said\".\n\nWait, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a more formal version, using synonyms where possible, adjusting sentence structure, and ensuring clarity. But how to reconcile all these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and adjusting the sentence structure. For example:\n\n- Replace \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany you\" (polite request).\n- Replace \"whole\" with \"entire\", \"made up\" with \"fabricated\".\n- Replace \"can you do\" with \"would you be able to accomplish\".\n- Replace \"considered many approaches\" with \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice).\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\".\n\nBut this approach would require knowing which words to replace and how to adjust the structure. However, the fifth example doesn't fit into this pattern. Unless \"got what you said\" is being rephrased as \"understood you\" by omitting the redundant part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more concise or direct statement about understanding, regardless of the original wording. But that seems too vague.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the outputs, they seem to be more formal or polite versions of the inputs. For example:\n\n- Input is a question, output is a polite request.\n- Input is a statement, output is a more formal version.\n- Input is a claim, output is a synonym-based version.\n\nBut the fifth example is a statement, and the output is also a statement. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more direct or concise statement about understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to translate the input into a more formal version by replacing certain words and adjusting the sentence structure. For example:\n\n- Replace \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany you\" (polite request).\n- Replace \"was made up\" with \"was fabricated\" (synonym).\n- Replace \"can you do\" with \"would you be able to accomplish\" (more formal possibility).\n- Replace \"considered many approaches\" with \"various approaches were considered\" (passive voice, more formal adjective).\n- Replace \"got what you said\" with \"understood you\" (more direct).\n\nBut this requires knowing which transformations to apply based on the input type. However, the fifth example doesn't fit into any obvious category. Unless \"got what you said\" is being rephrased as \"understood you\" by omitting \"what you said\" because it's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal version, using synonyms and adjusting sentence structure, but in some cases, like the fifth example, simply rephrasing \"got\" to \"understood\" and removing the redundant phrase.\n\nBut how to generalize this into a single instruction? Let's think of possible instructions that could cover all these cases.\n\nPossible instruction candidates:\n\n1. **Formalize the input**: Convert the input into a more formal or polite version, using synonyms and adjusting sentence structure as needed.\n2. **Rephrase into a more concise statement**: Remove unnecessary words and rephrase for clarity.\n3. **Translate into a synonym<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Let me start by analyzing each pair carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the first input-output pair:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\n\nWait, the output seems like a rephrasing but not exactly a translation. The original question is a yes/no question, and the output is a more polite request phrased as a statement. So maybe the instruction was to convert questions into statements with a different structure? But let's check other pairs to see if this holds.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"I think that this is interesting.\" → Output: \"It is my opinion that this is interesting.\"\n\nHere, the output is replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. So perhaps the instruction was to rephrase first-person opinions into third-person statements using \"it is my opinion\"?\n\nThird pair:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n\nThis is a greeting transformed into a more positive, anticipatory statement. So maybe the instruction was to turn casual greetings into expressions of anticipation or eagerness?\n\nFourth pair:\nInput: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nThe output is a more elaborate version of the original statement, replacing slang (\"fire\") with a synonym. So perhaps the task was to replace informal expressions with more formal or standard phrasing?\n\nFifth pair:\nInput: \"I considered many approaches.\" → Output: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n\nHere, the output is a passive voice construction, changing the subject from \"I\" to \"Various approaches.\" So maybe the instruction was to rewrite sentences in passive voice?\n\nNow, considering all these transformations, each input-output pair seems to involve a different type of rephrasing. However, the user mentioned that the friend followed the instruction for all inputs. Wait, but the outputs vary widely in structure. How can one instruction cover all these transformations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to translate or rephrase each input into a more formal or polite version. Let's see:\n\n- The first input was turned into a more polite request.\n- The second changed \"I think\" to a more formal expression.\n- The third turned a casual greeting into a more positive one.\n- The fourth replaced slang with a synonym.\n- The fifth used passive voice.\n\nBut how does that fit under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction was to make the output more formal or polite, but each example uses a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure but with different wording. For example, each output might be a variation of a template.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs again:\n\n1. Original question → rephrased as a statement asking ability.\n2. First-person opinion → third-person opinion.\n3. Casual greeting → expression of anticipation.\n4. Slang → more formal adjective.\n5. Active voice → passive voice.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to fit a single pattern. Unless the instruction was to perform multiple transformations depending on the input. But the problem states that the friend read the instruction once and applied it to all inputs. So there must be a common thread.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the instruction was to translate each input into a more formal or professional version. Let's check:\n\n1. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" – more formal.\n2. \"I think...\" becomes \"It is my opinion...\" – more formal.\n3. \"See you...\" becomes \"I look forward to...\" – more formal and positive.\n4. \"This song is fire\" becomes \"incredibly good\" – replacing slang with a stronger adjective.\n5. \"I considered...\" becomes \"Various approaches were considered\" – passive voice.\n\nSo maybe the instruction was to make the output more formal, polite, or use more standard phrasing. But how does that apply to all cases? For example, the fourth input/output pair is about replacing slang, which isn't directly related to formality. Similarly, the third pair is about changing the greeting into a more positive statement, which is more about tone than formality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure but with different words. For example, each output is a variation of a template. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n1. \"Would you be able to [verb] all these tasks?\" – replacing \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\".\n2. \"It is my opinion that [statement].\" – replacing \"I think\" with \"it is my opinion\".\n3. \"I look forward to [activity].\" – replacing \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting\".\n4. \"This song is [adjective].\" – replacing \"is fire\" with \"incredibly good\".\n5. \"Various approaches were [past participle].\" – replacing \"considered\" with \"were considered\".\n\nHmm, not sure. Another approach: maybe the instruction was to perform a specific transformation for each input type. For example, questions become requests, opinions become formal statements, greetings become anticipatory, slang becomes standard, and active voice becomes passive. But that would require the instruction to handle multiple cases, which might not be possible with a single instruction unless it's a general guideline.\n\nWait, the user says the friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every input. So the instruction must be a general rule that applies to all inputs. Let's think of possible instructions:\n\n1. **Make the output more polite or formal**: The first example fits (question to request), the second (first-person to third-person), third (greeting to anticipation), fourth (slang to standard), fifth (active to passive). But does making something more formal cover all these? For instance, the fourth example is about replacing slang, which isn't directly formal. The third example changes tone rather than formality. So maybe not.\n\n2. **Translate each input into a similar structure but with different wording**: For example, each output is a variation of a template. Let's see:\n\n   - Input 1: Question → Output 1: Statement asking ability.\n   - Input 2: Opinion → Output 2: Formal opinion.\n   - Input 3: Greeting → Output 3: Anticipatory statement.\n   - Input 4: Slang → Output 4: More descriptive adjective.\n   - Input 5: Active → Output 5: Passive.\n\n   Not sure if there's a common structure here. Maybe each output is a rephrasing using a certain phrase or structure. For example, replacing \"I think\" with \"It is my opinion\", but that only applies to the second input. Alternatively, each output is a variation of a template where the subject is changed or the verb is adjusted.\n\n3. **Use a specific translation or substitution**: For example, replacing certain phrases. But the substitutions vary too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar type of sentence. For example, all outputs are statements rather than questions or commands. Let's check:\n\n- Output 1: Statement.\n- Output 2: Statement.\n- Output 3: Statement.\n- Output 4: Statement.\n- Output 5: Statement.\n\nYes, all outputs are declarative statements. So maybe the instruction was to convert any input into a statement. But then why the different structures? For example, the first input was a question converted into a statement, the second was an opinion converted into a statement, etc. So the core instruction could be \"convert the input into a statement\". But then the outputs still vary in structure. For instance, the first output is a conditional statement, the second is a formal statement, the third is a future-oriented statement, the fourth is an adjective-based statement, the fifth is passive voice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure but with different wording. For example, each output is a variation of a template where the subject is changed or the verb is adjusted. Let's see:\n\n- Input 1: \"Can you...\" → Output 1: \"Would you be able to...\"\n   - Subject remains \"you\", but the structure changes from question to statement.\n- Input 2: \"I think...\" → Output 2: \"It is my opinion...\"\n   - Subject changes from \"I\" to \"it\", and the structure becomes a statement.\n- Input 3: \"See you...\" → Output 3: \"I look forward to...\"\n   - Subject changes from \"you\" to \"I\", and the structure becomes a statement of anticipation.\n- Input 4: \"This song is...\" → Output 4: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   - The structure remains the same (subject + is + adjective), but the adjective is replaced.\n- Input 5: \"I considered...\" → Output 5: \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - Subject changes from \"I\" to \"approaches\", and the structure becomes passive voice.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase each input into a similar structure but with different wording. For example, each output is a variation of a template where the subject is changed or the verb is adjusted. Let's hypothesize that the instruction was to rephrase each input into a statement using a similar structure but with different wording. \n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input is a question, rephrase it as a statement asking ability.\n- If the input is an opinion, rephrase it as a formal<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Let's check other examples.\n\nSecond pair:\nInput: \"See you tonight.\" → Output: \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\nHere, the output is a more formal or polite version of the input. \"See you\" is transformed into \"look forward to meeting you\", which is a common way to express the same idea but in a more positive or anticipatory tone.\n\nThird input-output:\nInput: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\nAgain, the output uses a synonym (\"find it hard to distinguish\") instead of \"can't tell the difference\". Also, the structure changes slightly. The original is in present tense, while the output might be using a different phrasing.\n\nFourth example:\nInput: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → Output: \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\"\nHere, the question is rephrased. The original is a yes/no question, and the output turns it into a more polite request using \"would you be able to...\". The key seems to be changing the sentence structure and sometimes replacing words with synonyms.\n\nFifth input-output:\nInput: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\nThis is another question rephrasing. The original is a direct question about wanting someone to go with them, and the output uses \"shall I...\" which is a more formal or traditional way to ask for permission or assistance.\n\nNow, looking for a pattern across all these transformations. Let's list possible elements:\n\n1. **Question vs. Statement**: Some inputs are questions, others are statements. The outputs seem to handle both. For example, the fourth input is a question, output is also a question but phrased differently. The fifth input is a question, output is a question phrased as a suggestion.\n\n2. **Politeness Level**: The outputs often use more formal or polite language. For instance, \"look forward to\" instead of \"see you\", \"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\".\n\n3. **Synonym Replacement**: Words like \"understood\" (from \"got\"), \"look forward to\" (from \"see\"), \"find it hard to distinguish\" (from \"can't tell the difference\"), \"be able to accomplish\" (from \"do you want me to...\").\n\n4. **Sentence Structure Changes**: The structure of the sentences is altered. For example, the third input is a statement, output is also a statement but with a different verb phrase. The fourth input is a question, output is a question with a different structure.\n\n5. **Imperative to Question or Vice Versa**: The fifth input is a question asking for accompaniment, output is a question suggesting accompaniment. The fourth input is a question asking capability, output is a question asking ability.\n\nWait, but the first input is a statement, output is a statement. So maybe the instruction isn't about turning statements into questions? Or perhaps it's about rephrasing in a more polite manner regardless of the original sentence type.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the verbs used. The original verbs are \"got\", \"see\", \"can't tell\", \"do you want\", \"do you want\". The outputs use \"understood\", \"look forward to\", \"find it hard to distinguish\", \"be able to\", \"shall I accompany\".\n\nNoticing that some verbs are replaced with their synonyms, and others are rephrased entirely. For example, \"do you want me to go with you?\" becomes \"shall I accompany you?\" which is a complete restructuring.\n\nLet me think about possible instructions. Maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly converting questions into suggestions or offers. Alternatively, it could be about replacing certain phrases with their synonyms while maintaining the overall meaning.\n\nLooking at the first example: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" Here, \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\". Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So maybe the instruction involves replacing certain phrases with their synonyms. But why only some phrases?\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a more formal or polite response. For example, replacing contractions with full forms, using more formal verbs, etc.\n\nBut let's check the second example: \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\" This is a common way to respond to \"See you later\" in a more polite way. So maybe the instruction is to turn casual expressions into more formal or positive ones.\n\nThird example: \"I can't tell the difference\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish.\" Again, a synonym replacement but with a slight change in structure.\n\nFourth example: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" → \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is rephrased into a more polite form, using \"would you be able to\" instead of \"can you\".\n\nFifth example: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → \"Shall I accompany you?\" This is a complete rephrasing into a suggestion rather than a direct question.\n\nPutting this together, the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly converting questions into offers or suggestions. However, looking at the first example, it's a statement turned into another statement. So maybe the instruction is broader: take any input and rephrase it in a more polite or formal way, adjusting sentence structure as needed.\n\nBut let's see if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms and adjust the sentence structure accordingly. Let's check the first input again: \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\" So \"got\" is replaced with \"understood\". Similarly, \"can't tell the difference\" becomes \"find it hard to distinguish\". So perhaps the instruction involved replacing specific phrases with their synonyms. But why only those phrases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to convert the input into a more formal version by replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, and adjusting the sentence structure. For example, replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I accompany you\" is a significant structural change, but maybe the instruction was to rephrase the entire sentence into a more polite form, possibly using \"shall\" or \"would you mind\" or similar.\n\nWait, the fifth input is a question, and the output is a question phrased as a suggestion. So maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more polite form, possibly converting questions into offers or suggestions. But how does that apply to the first input, which is a statement?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more positive or affirming response. For example, taking a neutral statement and making it more positive. But the first input is already positive (\"I understood you\"), so maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: look for common elements in all outputs. All outputs are more formal or polite than the inputs. The first input is a statement, output is a statement. Second is a greeting, output is a more formal greeting. Third is a complaint or observation, output is a more measured response. Fourth is a question asking capability, output is a question asking ability. Fifth is a question asking for accompaniment, output is a suggestion.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction was to rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version, possibly converting questions into offers or suggestions. But how to generalize this into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction was to replace certain phrases with their synonyms and adjust the sentence structure. For example, replacing \"can't tell the difference\" with \"find it hard to distinguish\", \"do you want me to\" with \"shall I\", \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you\", etc.\n\nBut why only those phrases? Unless the instruction was to replace specific phrases that were identified in the examples. But since the user provided five examples, maybe the instruction was to apply a set of rules that cover those cases.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to convert the input into a more formal version by replacing contractions, using more formal verbs, and adjusting the sentence structure. For example, replacing \"do you want\" with \"shall I\", \"can you\" with \"would you be able to\", \"see you\" with \"look forward to meeting you\", etc.\n\nBut how to formulate this as a single instruction? Let's think about possible instructions that could generate these outputs.\n\nPossible instruction candidates:\n\n1. **Rephrase the input into a more polite or formal version**:\n   - Convert questions into offers or suggestions.\n   - Replace contractions with full forms.\n   - Use more formal verbs (e.g., \"understand\" instead of \"got\", \"accomplish\" instead of \"do\").\n   - Adjust sentence structure to be more polite (e.g., \"Would you be able to...\" instead of \"Can you...\").\n\n2. **Replace specific phrases**:\n   - \"I got what you said.\" → \"I understood you.\"\n   - \"Can you do all these tasks<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, the user provided five examples where their friend transformed each input into an output according to some rule. My job is to reverse-engineer that rule to find the instruction.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the input-output pairs again to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n1. Input: \"Please call once you get there.\" → Output: \"Please call upon your arrival.\"\n2. Input: \"We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.\" → Output: \"It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.\"\n3. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\" → Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n4. Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n5. Input: \"This song is fire.\" → Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n\nLet me analyze each pair one by one.\n\nStarting with the first pair. The input is a simple request to call when arriving. The output changes \"once you get there\" to \"upon your arrival.\" So maybe the instruction involves replacing certain phrases or rephrasing in a more formal way? Like converting informal expressions to more polite or standard English?\n\nSecond input: The original statement is negative (\"don't think it's a good idea\") and uses \"right now.\" The output rephrases it as a suggestion using \"it is suggested that...\" and changes \"right now\" to \"at this stage.\" So perhaps the instruction is to convert negative suggestions into positive recommendations phrased differently?\n\nThird input: A question asking if the speaker should go with someone. The output uses \"Shall I...\" instead of \"Do you want me to...\" and changes \"go with you\" to \"accompany you.\" So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into statements using different interrogative structures, like changing \"Do you want X?\" to \"Shall I X?\" and adjusting the verb accordingly.\n\nFourth input: The original uses \"I met yesterday\" and the output adds \"whom\" before \"I met.\" So here, the instruction might involve inserting relative pronouns like \"whom\" when referring to past meetings, especially in certain contexts. But why only here? Maybe the instruction is to add \"whom\" whenever the subject is the person being addressed, but that doesn't fit all cases. Alternatively, maybe it's about formalizing the sentence structure by using more formal pronouns or clauses.\n\nFifth input: \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good.\" So the instruction might involve replacing informal adjectives with more elaborate or specific ones. But why \"incredibly good\"? Maybe the instruction is to replace slang or informal expressions with more formal or descriptive alternatives. However, \"fire\" is slang for something great, so replacing it with \"incredibly good\" makes sense as a more formal equivalent.\n\nNow, looking for common elements across all outputs. Let's see:\n\n- Formality: Outputs seem more formal than inputs. For example, \"upon your arrival\" vs. \"once you get there,\" \"suggested\" vs. \"don't think it's a good idea,\" \"shall I accompany\" vs. \"do you want me to go with you,\" etc. So maybe the instruction is to rewrite the input in a more formal tone.\n\n- Sentence structure: Some outputs change the sentence structure. For instance, the third input is a question, and the output is a statement starting with \"Shall I...\" which is a different structure. Similarly, the fourth input adds a relative clause (\"whom I met yesterday\").\n\nWait, but not all outputs change the structure. The first input's structure remains similar, just the phrase is changed. The second input's structure is completely different (negative to positive suggestion). The fifth input's structure is unchanged except for the adjective.\n\nAnother angle: looking for transformations that could be part of a larger pattern. For example, the third input's transformation from \"Do you want me to go with you?\" to \"Shall I accompany you?\" suggests that the instruction might involve converting questions into statements using \"Shall I...\" and changing the verb. But why only in this case? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into imperative or conditional statements, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to translate the input into a more polite or formal version, possibly using different conjunctions, tenses, or phrasing. Let's check each example under this hypothesis.\n\nFirst example: \"Please call once you get there.\" → \"Please call upon your arrival.\" Both are polite requests, but the second uses a more formal prepositional phrase. So maybe replacing \"once you\" with \"upon your\" to sound more formal.\n\nSecond example: The original is a negative suggestion, and the output is a positive suggestion phrased formally. So perhaps the instruction is to take negative suggestions and turn them into positive recommendations, using more formal language.\n\nThird example: The question is turned into a statement using \"Shall I...\" which is a formal way to ask for permission. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase yes/no questions into statements using \"Shall I...\" followed by the action.\n\nFourth example: Adding \"whom I met yesterday\" to make it more formal. So perhaps the instruction is to insert relative clauses when referring to past meetings, especially if the subject is the person being addressed.\n\nFifth example: Replacing informal slang (\"fire\") with a more formal description (\"incredibly good\"). So maybe the instruction is to replace informal terms with more elaborate or specific synonyms.\n\nBut how do these transformations fit into a single instruction? Let's see if there's a common thread.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they all seem to be more formal versions of the inputs. The first example uses a more formal preposition. The second example turns a negative into a positive suggestion. The third example converts a question into a formal statement. The fourth example adds a relative clause for formality. The fifth example replaces slang with a more descriptive term.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is to rewrite the input in a more formal style, possibly by making the following changes:\n\n- Replace informal expressions with more formal equivalents.\n- Convert negative suggestions into positive recommendations.\n- Turn questions into formal statements using \"Shall I...\" or similar.\n- Add relative clauses for past meetings to sound more formal.\n- Replace slang with more descriptive or formal terms.\n\nBut how to combine these into a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to \"rephrase each input into a more formal version, using appropriate conjunctions, tenses, and phrasing to enhance politeness and clarity.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be more specific. For example, \"Replace 'once you' with 'upon your' in all cases.\" But that doesn't explain the other transformations. Or \"Convert negative suggestions into positive recommendations phrased formally.\" But again, that's too specific.\n\nWait, looking at the third example: the input is a question, and the output is a statement starting with \"Shall I...\" which is a formal way to ask for permission. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase yes/no questions into statements using \"Shall I...\" followed by the action. That would explain the third example. But does that apply to others? Let's check:\n\nFirst example: Not a question, so maybe irrelevant. Second example: Negative suggestion becomes positive recommendation. Fourth example: Adds a relative clause. Fifth example: Slang replaced.\n\nHmm, maybe the instruction is a combination of multiple rules. But the problem states that the friend followed a single instruction to generate all outputs. So there must be a single underlying rule that applies to all inputs.\n\nLet me think again. All outputs seem to be more formal. The first example uses \"upon your arrival\" instead of \"once you get there.\" The second example turns a negative into a positive suggestion. The third example converts a question into a formal statement. The fourth example adds a relative clause. The fifth example replaces slang with a more formal term.\n\nWait, maybe the instruction is to \"politefy\" the input by making it more formal, using different conjunctions, phrasing, etc. But how to generalize that into a single instruction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to \"convert the input into a more formal version by replacing certain phrases and adjusting sentence structure as needed.\" But that's vague.\n\nWait, looking at the third example: the input is a question, and the output is a statement starting with \"Shall I...\" which is a common way to rephrase a question into a formal request. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase yes/no questions into statements using \"Shall I...\" followed by the action. But then why does the second example not follow that? Because the second example is a statement, not a question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to rephrase any request into a formal statement using \"Shall I...\" for questions and adjust other parts for formality. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instruction is to \"translate the input into a more formal version by replacing informal expressions with their formal equivalents, adjusting sentence structure for clarity and formality, and ensuring politeness.\"\n\nBut the problem is that the instruction needs to be precise enough that a friend could follow it and produce all those outputs. Let's see if there's a common element across all outputs.\n\nAnother approach: look for words or phrases that appear in the outputs but not in the inputs. For example, \"upon your arrival\" (not in input), \"It is suggested that\" (input has \"We don't think...\"), \"accompany\" (input says \"go with you\"), \"whom\" (input says \"I met yesterday\"), \"incredibly good\" (input<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"

Hmm, first, I need to look at each input-output pair and see if there's a pattern or transformation applied.\n\nStarting with the first example: Input is \"This song is fire.\" Output is \"This song is incredibly good.\" So here, the original phrase uses slang (\"fire\") which is replaced with a more formal or descriptive term (\"incredibly good\"). Maybe the instruction is to replace informal expressions with more standard phrasing?\n\nSecond input: \"Can you do all these tasks?\" becomes \"Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?\" Here, the question is rephrased using \"would\" instead of \"can,\" and \"accomplish\" is added. So perhaps the instruction involves converting questions into more polite forms, replacing \"can\" with \"would be able to\"?\n\nThird input: \"I got what you said.\" Output is \"I understood you.\" The original is a concise statement, and the output is a more direct expression of understanding. Maybe the instruction is to rephrase affirmative statements into clearer expressions of comprehension?\n\nFourth input: \"She looks like her sister.\" Output is \"She resembles her sister.\" The verb \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain verbs with their synonyms or more formal equivalents?\n\nFifth input: \"Please call once you get there.\" Output is \"Please call upon your arrival.\" The original uses \"once you get there,\" which is replaced with \"upon your arrival.\" So perhaps the instruction involves rephrasing time-related expressions into more formal or specific terms.\n\nNow, looking for a common thread across all these transformations. Let's list possible patterns:\n\n1. Slang to Formal: Replacing informal slang (like \"fire\") with more standard adjectives.\n2. Question Rephrasing: Converting \"can\" questions into \"would be able to\" and adding \"accomplish.\"\n3. Affirmative to Comprehension: Changing \"got what you said\" to \"understood you.\"\n4. Synonym Replacement: \"Looks like\" → \"resembles.\"\n5. Time Expression: \"Once you get there\" → \"Upon your arrival.\"\n\nHmm, but how do these fit under a single instruction? Maybe the instruction is to rephrase the input in a more polite or formal way. Let's check each example against this hypothesis.\n\nFirst input: \"fire\" is colloquial, replaced with \"incredibly good\" which is more formal. That fits. Second input: \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is more polite. Third input: \"I got what you said\" is concise, output is \"I understood you\" which is clearer. Fourth input: \"looks like\" is replaced with \"resembles,\" which is a synonym but more formal. Fifth input: \"once you get there\" is rephrased into \"upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way to express the same idea.\n\nSo the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more polite, formal, or clear version. But let's see if there's another angle. For example, maybe the instruction is to make the output more positive or affirming. Let's check:\n\nFirst output is positive (\"incredibly good\"), second output is also positive (\"able to accomplish\"), third is neutral but clearer, fourth is neutral, fifth is positive (\"call upon your arrival\" could be seen as polite). Not sure if positivity is the main factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or more formal versions. For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"can\" → \"be able to,\" \"got what you said\" → \"understood you,\" \"looks like\" → \"resembles,\" \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival.\"\n\nWait, but \"can\" to \"be able to\" isn't exactly a synonym; it's a different structure. Similarly, \"can you do\" vs. \"would you be able to accomplish.\" So maybe the instruction is to convert questions into more polite requests or statements. For example, changing \"Can you...\" to \"Would you be able to...\" and adding \"accomplish.\"\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more formal or indirect. For instance, \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"Please call upon your arrival,\" which is a more formal way of expressing the same request. Similarly, \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a more direct statement.\n\nPutting all this together, the instruction might be to rephrase the input into a more polite, formal, or clear version. Alternatively, it could be to replace certain phrases with their synonyms or more formal equivalents. Let's test this hypothesis against all examples.\n\nFirst example: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (slang to adjective). Second: \"can\" → \"would be able to\" (question to polite request). Third: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" (concise to clear). Fourth: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (synonym). Fifth: \"once you get there\" → \"upon your arrival\" (time expression).\n\nSo the instruction could be something like: \"Replace informal expressions with more formal alternatives, rephrase questions into polite requests, and make the output clearer or more direct.\"\n\nBut let's see if there's a more precise instruction. For example, maybe the instruction is to \"politefy\" the input by making it more formal or indirect. Alternatively, it could be to \"rephrase the input into a more positive or affirming tone.\"\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, they seem to be more positive than the inputs. For example, \"fire\" becomes \"incredibly good,\" which is more positive. \"Can you...\" becomes \"Would you be able to...\" which is still a question but more polite. \"I got what you said\" becomes \"I understood you,\" which is a positive confirmation. \"She looks like her sister\" becomes \"resembles,\" which is neutral but perhaps more formal. \"Please call once you get there\" becomes \"upon your arrival,\" which is a bit more formal.\n\nWait, but \"resembles\" is a synonym, not necessarily more formal. However, \"upon your arrival\" is a more formal way to say \"when you arrive.\" So maybe the instruction is to replace certain phrases with their more formal equivalents, especially when it comes to time expressions and questions.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"make the output more formal by replacing informal terms and rephrasing questions into more polite forms.\"\n\nAnother possibility: the instruction is to \"convert the input into a more positive or affirming statement.\" Let's check:\n\nFirst input: \"fire\" → \"incredibly good\" (positive). Second: \"can you...\" → \"would you be able to...\" (still a question but more polite). Third: \"got what you said\" → \"understood you\" (affirmative). Fourth: \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (neutral but perhaps more formal). Fifth: \"call once you get there\" → \"call upon your arrival\" (more formal). So some are more positive, others are just formal.\n\nBut the fifth example's output is \"Please call upon your arrival,\" which is more formal but not necessarily positive. So maybe the primary instruction is to make the output more formal or polite, regardless of positivity.\n\nLooking back at the examples, the key transformations are:\n\n- Slang to more formal adjectives (fire → incredibly good)\n- Questions to polite requests (can you... → would you be able to...)\n- Concise statements to clearer affirmations (got what you said → understood you)\n- Synonyms for \"looks like\" (resembles)\n- Time expressions to more formal phrasing (once you get there → upon your arrival)\n\nSo the instruction could be: \"Rephrase the input into a more formal or polite version by replacing informal terms, rephrasing questions into more polite forms, and making the output clearer or more direct.\"\n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be to \"politefy\" the input by converting questions into more polite requests, replacing informal expressions with more formal ones, and rephrasing time-related expressions into more formal terms.\n\nAnother angle: the outputs seem to be more positive or affirming. For example, \"incredibly good\" is a strong positive, \"understood you\" is an affirmation, \"resembles\" is neutral but perhaps more formal. However, the fifth example's output is more formal but not necessarily positive. So maybe the primary focus is on formality rather than positivity.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"make the output more positive by replacing negative or neutral terms with positive ones.\" But in the first example, \"fire\" is positive, so that doesn't fit. The third example's input is neutral, output is positive. The fifth example's input is neutral, output is positive. So maybe the instruction is to add positivity where possible, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the instruction could be to \"replace certain phrases with their more positive counterparts.\" For example, \"fire\" → \"incredibly good,\" \"looks like\" → \"resembles\" (which is neutral but perhaps more formal), but that doesn't explain the second example.\n\nWait, the second example's input is a question, output is a rephrased question. So maybe the instruction is to rephrase questions into more polite forms, replacing \"can\" with \"would be able to\" and adding \"accomplish.\"\n\nThird example: \"I got what you said\" → \"I understood you.\" So replacing \"got\" with \"understood,\" which is a stronger<|end_of_thought|><|endoftext|>"
