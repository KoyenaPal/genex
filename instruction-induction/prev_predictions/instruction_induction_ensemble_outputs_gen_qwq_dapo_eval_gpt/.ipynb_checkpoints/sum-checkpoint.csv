<think>
<think> Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what the instruction was that my friend used to generate these outputs from the inputs. Let's examine the pattern in the given input-output pairs:

The pairs given are:

- Input: 7 84 → Output: 9 1
- Input: 52 71 → Output: 123
Wait, hold on, actually looking back, the outputs are single numbers, not two numbers. Let me check again. The user listed the outputs as single numbers:

First pair: Input 7 , 84 → Output 91.
Second pair: Input 52,71 → Output 123.
Third: 8,64 → 72.
Fourth:76, 99 →175.
Fifth:22, 8 1 →103.

Hmm. So each input is two numbers, say (a, b), and there seems to be a relationship where the output is derived from a and b. Let me list them again clearly: 1. (7, 84) → 91 , 
2. (52, 71) → 1 23, 
3. (8, 64) → 72,
4. (76, 99) →1 75, 
and 5. (22, 81 ) → 103.

Wait, maybe I misread the outputs . Let me check again. The user wrote:

Input: 7 84 → Output: 91

Yes, so each input is two numbers separated by a space (like `7 84`), and the output is obtained from those two numbers via some rule. So the task is to find what mathematical or logical operation is applied to the two input numbers to get the output . The instruction is probably something like ""Add the two numbers"", but let's see.

Let me check each case.

First example: 7 and 84 → 91. 7 + 84 = 91. That's exactly that. Second input 52 and 71 → 123. 52 + 7 1 = 123. Third input: 8 and 6 4 → 72. 8 + 64 = 7 2. 
The fourth one: 76 and 99 → 1 75; 76 + 9 9 = 175. Wait, 76 + 99 is actually 175, yes. Because 76 + 9 9 = 175. So 76+99= 175. 

Wait a second, in the first case 7 +84=91, second 52+71= 123, third 8+64=72, fourth 76+99=175, fifth 22 +81=103. All of them add the two numbers . So maybe the instruction is simply ""Add the two numbers together"". But wait, let me check each case again to be sure.

Wait, for the $5^{th}$ input: 2 2, and 8 1. So adding 22 to 8 1 gives 22 +81=103. Yes, that works.

So the instruction is to add the two given numbers together. The correct rule applied seems to be simply taking the sum of the two input numbers.

So the instruction was to add the two given numbers together. So the instruction would be something like: ""Add the two numbers provided and output the result.""

Now that we have figured out the instruction, let’s confirm each case again:

1. 7 +84 = 9 1 ✔️
2. 52 +71 = 1 2 3 ✔️ 
3. 8 + 64 = 7 2✔️
4. 76 +99= 1 75✔️
5. 2 2 + 8 1 = 103. ✔️

It looks like the outputs are indeed the sums of the given pairs of inputs. Therefore, the instruction must have been to add the two numbers and output their sum.

<think> It seems like the instruction involves adding the two numbers provided in each input. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs to confirm this.

- For the first input 0 54, adding them gives 0 + 54 = 54. This matches the output 54 . - The second input 67 84 adds to 6 7 + 84 = 151. This matches the output 151. - The third input 7 66 gives 7 + 66 = 73. This matches the output 73. - The fourth input 55 85 results in 55 + 85 = 140. This matches the output 140. - Lastly, 29 48 sums to 29 + 48 = 7 7. That matches the output 77.

So, the instruction must be ""Add the two provided numbers.""

Now, based on this rule: For any input like a b, the output is a + b.

Let 's write the instruction explicitly:

Looking at the first input, 13 + 41 equals 54, which matches the given output. For the second input, 29 + 42 equals 7 1, which also aligns with the output. For the third input, 76 + 76 equals 1 52, which is correct. For the fourth input, 19 + 90 equals 1 09, and the last input 37 + 44 equals 81. Wait, but 37 + 44 is actually 81, so that works too. Hmm, so all the outputs are the sum of the two numbers in the input. So the instruction appears to be to sum two given numbers.</think>

<think> It seems like the instruction is to add the two given numbers together and output the sum. Let me check each input-output pair to see if that holds :

1. Input: 29 29
The sum of 29 + 29 is 58. The given output is 58. This matches. 2. Input: 20 68
The sum of 20 + 68 is 88. The given output is 88. This also matches. 3. Input: 43 51
The sum of 43 + 51 is 94. The given output is 94. This matches too. 4. Input: 37 49
The sum of 37 + 49 is 86. The output is 86. This correct as well. 5. Input: 5 8 The sum of 5 + 8 is 13. The output is 13. All pairs check out. Therefore, the instruction is likely to add the two numbers given in each input and output the resultant sum.

So the instruction can be: ""Add the two numbers given in the input and produce their sum.""

Based on this, the instruction to your friend must have been something like: ""For each input, add the two numbers together and write the result as the output.""

<think>
<think> It seems like the instruction involves a simple pattern or operation between the two given numbers in each input pair to produce the output. Let’s analyze the given input-output pairs to identify the pattern or rule. Looking at the first input (12, 99) and output 111, maybe adding the two numbers: 12 + 99 = 111, which matches the output. Let's check the other inputs to confirm this rule:

1. For the pair (29, 33), if we add the two numbers : 29 + 33 = 62. This matches the output 62.

2. For (2, 50 ): 2 + 50 = 52. That also matches the output 52.

3. For (29, 5 5): 29 + 55 = 84. The output is 84, so it checks out.

4. Lastly, for the input (33, 83): 33 + 83 = 116. The output is indeed 1 16.

The pattern is consistently that the output is the sum of the two numbers in the input pair. Therefore, the instruction must have been to add the two numbers provided in each input pair to get the output. So, the instruction can be: ""Add the two given numbers together .""

Assistant 
The instruction is to add two given numbers together. For any input pair of two numbers (A, B), the output is A + B.

Now that we have figured out the instruction, if you give another input pair, I can compute the output based on this rule. Let me know if you want to test another input! **Final Answer**
The instruction was to add the two numbers. So, for any input pair (a, b), the output is \ [ \text{output} = a + b. \]

The instruction can be written as:

\boxed{Add the two numbers}

Wait, but the user wants the instruction, which is the answer : the instruction was **""To add two given numbers.""** 

Assistant 's final answer should be the instruction, so boxed as per their request. Assistant 
Yes, the instruction given to your friend was to **"" Add the two given numbers.""**

So the final answer is to add the two numbers, which can be represented as \boxed{Add the two numbers .}

Now it’s clear. The user wants the instruction, so the answer is the instruction, which is adding the two numbers. So the boxed answer is the instruction. **Final Answer**
The instruction was to add the two numbers, so for any input $(a, b),$ output is $a + b$ .

The instruction is boxed as per the user's requirement. The user might expect the instruction in a specific phrasing. The original instruction probably was ""Add the two numbers"" or similar. So the boxed answer is:

\boxed{\text{Add the two numbers }}

Alternatively, if the instruction was a mathematical expression, but the user says they gave an instruction, so likely the instruction was a phrase like ""Add the two numbers."" Since the user wants the instruction, the answer is in words inside the box. The system prompt says to put the final answer within \boxed{...} to box it in latex, so it goes like :

\boxed{Add the two numbers}

Yes, that's the instruction .

So the final boxed instruction is \boxed{Add the two numbers . }
