I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 7 84 → Output: 91\n2. Input: 52 71 → Output: 123\n3. Input: 8 64 → Output: 72\n4. Input: 76 99 → Output: 175\n5. Input: 22 81 → Output: 103\n\nHmm, let's look for a pattern or mathematical operation that connects the inputs to the output.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, or something else.\n\nLet me list the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. Input: 7 and 84; Output: 91\n2. Input: 52 and 71; Output: 123\n3. Input: 8 and 64; Output: 72\n4. Input: 76 and 99; Output: 175\n5. Input: 22 and 81; Output: 103\n\nLet me check if it's a sum: 7 + 84 = 91. Oh! The first input is 7 and 84, output is 91, which is exactly 7 + 84. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 52 + 71 = 123. Output is 123. So that works too.\n\nThird input: 8 + 64 = 72. Output is 72. Perfect, that matches.\n\nFourth input: 76 + 99 = 175. Let me calculate 76 + 99: 76 + 99 is indeed 175. So that works.\n\nFifth input: 22 + 81 = 103. 22 + 81 is 103. That also matches.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 7 + 84 = 91 ✔️\n2. 52 + 71 = 123 ✔️\n3. 8 + 64 = 72 ✔️\n4. 76 + 99 = 175 ✔️\n5. 22 + 81 = 103 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So maybe the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 7*84 = 588 ≠91. So nope.\n\nSubtraction: 84 -7=77≠91. Not that either.\n\nWhat about multiplication of the two numbers minus something? 7*84=588; 588 minus something? 588 - something =91? 588 - 497=91? Doesn't seem meaningful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 7 concatenated with 84 is 784, which isn't 91. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 7* something + something? Let me think differently.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n91, 123,72,175,103.\n\nIs there another pattern? Maybe product minus something?\n\nFirst output: 91. 7*13=91, but 13 is not related to 84.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first input: 7 and 84. Maybe 7*13=91, but 13 is 84/6.666... Not helpful.\n\nSecond input: 52 and71. 52* something? 52* something is 123? 123/52≈2.36, not integer.\n\nThird input: 8*9=72, which is the output. Fourth input: 76* something? 76*2.25=171, not 175. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe it's a function like a*b + a or something.\n\nFirst input: 7*84 + something? 7*84=588. 588 + something =91? That would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 84 -7=77≠91. 84 + something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n91 is 7*13, 123 is 52* something? 52*2=104, close but not 123. 72 is 8*9, 175 is 76*2.29, 103 is 22*something + something.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nBut the first four outputs match the sum. Let me check the last one:\n\n22 +81=103, which is the output. So maybe the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\n1. 7 +84=91 ✔️\n2.52 +71=123 ✔️\n3.8 +64=72 ✔️\n4.76 +99=175 ✔️\n5.22 +81=103 ✔️\n\nYes, all match. So perhaps the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if it's a different operation. Maybe it's concatenation? 7 concatenated with 84 is 784, which isn't 91. So no.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 7*84=588; 588 minus 588 +91= something? 588 - 497=91? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 84 -7=77, not 91.\n\nWait, 7*13=91, 13 is 84/6.46... Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 7 + (8+4)=19? No, 7+ something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's 7*13=91, but 13 is 8 + 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second. Let's try:\n\nFor first input: 7 and 84. Output is 91.\n\nLet me see: 7*a + b =91, where a and b relate to 84.\n\n84 is 12*7, so 7*13=91. So maybe 7*(something) + something.\n\nWait, 7*13=91, and 13 is 84/6.46... Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 7 + 8* something. 8*11 +7=95≠91. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 7*13=91, 13 is 8 + 5, but 5 is not 4? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 7 + 84 =91, which is straightforward.\n\nSimilarly, 52 +71=123, which is straightforward.\n\nSo perhaps the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the other outputs:\n\n8 +64=72, which is 72. 72 is 8*9 or 64 - (- something). 8+64=72.\n\n76 +99=175. 76 +99=175, correct.\n\n22 +81=103, correct.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: input a and b, output a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm:\n\nFirst input:7 +84=91 ✔️\n\nSecond:52 +71=123 ✔️\n\nThird:8 +64=72 ✔️\n\nFourth:76 +99=175 ✔️\n\nFifth:22 +81=103 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is to sum the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects an instruction phrase, maybe \"add the two numbers\" or \"sum the two inputs.\"\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again: \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The instruction was...\" So likely it's a specific operation.\n\nGiven all the examples, it's addition.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nThe rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two"

Let's list out the inputs and outputs again:\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n\n1. Input: 0 54 → Output: 54\n2. Input: 67 84 → Output: 151\n3. Input: 7 66 → Output: 73\n4. Input: 55 85 → Output: 140\n5. Input: 29 48 → Output: 77\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's an operation on two numbers a and b resulting in some function f(a, b) = something.\n\nLooking at the first input-output pair: Input is 0 and 54, output is 54. That suggests that if one of the numbers is zero, the output is the other number. So maybe it's something like a + b if b is non-zero? Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, let's test the first case: Input 0 and 54. If it's 0 + 54, that would be 54, which matches the output. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 67 and 84. Output is 151. Let's see: 67 + 84 is 151. Oh, that works. Third input: 7 and 66. 7 + 66 is 73, which matches the output. Fourth input: 55 and 85. 55 + 85 is 140, which matches the output. Fifth input: 29 and 48. 29 + 48 is 77, which matches the output.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 0 + 54 = 54 ✔️\n2. 67 + 84 = 151 ✔️\n3. 7 + 66 = 73 ✔️\n4. 55 + 85 = 140 ✔️\n5. 29 + 48 = 77 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's a different operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 0*54=0 ≠54. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 54 - 0 =54, but the second input is 84 -67=17≠151. So nope.\n\nMaybe product? 0*54=0≠54? No. 67*84=5628≠151. Nope.\n\nMaybe something else like absolute difference? |0 -54|=54, which matches the first output. Let's check the second input: |67 -84|=17≠151. Doesn't match. So nope.\n\nMaybe sum of squares? 0² +54²= 0 + 2916=2916≠54. Nope.\n\nWait, let's think of another approach. Maybe it's concatenation? 0 and 54 concatenated is 054 which is 54, but 54 is the output. Then 67 and 84 concatenated is 6784, but the output is 151, which is not that. So probably not concatenation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second? Let's try:\n\nFor first input: 0 and 54. Output is 54. So 0 * something +54 =54. So 0*anything is 0, so 0 +54=54. So maybe it's b.\n\nSecond input: 67 and 84. Output is 151. Let's see 67* something +84=151. Let's solve: 67x +84=151 → 67x=67 → x=1. So it's 1*67 +84=151. Hmm, interesting.\n\nThird input:7 and 66. Output is73. Let's see: 7x +66=73 →7x=7→x=1. So 1*7 +66=73. That works.\n\nFourth input:55 and85. Output is140. 55x +85=140→55x=55→x=1. So 1*55 +85=140. Correct.\n\nFifth input:29 and48. Output is77. 29x +48=77→29x=29→x=1. So 1*29 +48=77. Perfect.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: output = 1 * first number + second number.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst input: 0 and54: 0*1 +54=54. Correct.\n\nSecond input:67*1 +84=151. Correct.\n\nThird input:7*1 +66=73. Correct.\n\nFourth input:55*1 +85=140. Correct.\n\nFifth input:29*1 +48=77. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is: take the first number, add the second number. So the instruction is \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two inputs.\n\nWait, let me check if it's always the case. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. Then output is a + b? Let's see:\n\nFirst case: 0 +54=54. Second:67+84=151, yes. Third:7+66=73, yes. Fourth:55+85=140, yes. Fifth:29+48=77. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output = first input + second input.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's see if it's a multiplication: 0*54=0≠54. 67*84=5628≠151. So nope.\n\nIf it's difference: 84 -67=17≠151. No.\n\nIf it's product minus something? 67*2=134≠151. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a function like a^b or something? 0^54 is 0≠54. 67^84 is a huge number≠151. So nope.\n\nSo seems like addition is the only consistent one.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: output = a + b where a and b are the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all the examples:\n\nFirst input: 0 and54: 0+54=54. Correct.\n\nSecond:67+84=151. Correct.\n\nThird:7+66=73. Correct.\n\nFourth:55+85=140. Correct.\n\nFifth:29+48=77. Correct.\n\nYes, all match. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the user probably had an instruction like \"add the two numbers\" or \"sum the two inputs.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is to sum the two inputs. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: The instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the output is the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as: The output is the sum of the two input numbers. So the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nBut since the user wants the instruction, probably written as \"add the two numbers.\" So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition.\n\nThus, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as: add the first input and the second input together.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the box should be:\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. Therefore, the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the instruction was</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the inputs into outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 29 29, Output: 58\n2. Input: 20 68, Output: 88\n3. Input: 43 51, Output: 94\n4. Input: 37 49, Output: 86\n5. Input: 5 8, Output: 13\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLooking at the first pair: Input (29, 29) gives Output 58. Let's see possible operations:\n\n- Sum: 29 + 29 = 58. That works here.\n- Maybe a + b? Let's check the next ones.\n\nSecond input: (20, 68) gives 88. Let's see: 20 + 68 = 88. That also works.\n\nThird input: (43, 51) gives 94. 43 + 51 = 94. Yep, same result.\n\nFourth input: (37, 49) gives 86. Let's check: 37 + 49 = 86. Yes, that works too.\n\nFifth input: (5, 8) gives 13. 5 + 8 = 13. Perfect, that also works.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all outputs:\n\n1. 29 + 29 = 58 ✔️\n2. 20 + 68 = 88 ✔️\n3. 43 + 51 = 94 ✔️\n4. 37 + 49 = 86 ✔️\n5. 5 + 8 = 13 ✔️\n\nSo it seems consistent. Maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 29*2 = 58? Wait, 29*2 is 58, but second input: 20* something? 20*4.4=88? Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 29 and 29 make 2929, but 2929 is way bigger than 58. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, subtracting? 29 - 29 = 0, no. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 29*2=58, yes, 2*29=58. Let's check the next input: 20 and 68. 20* something? 20*4.4=88? Doesn't fit a simple pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two numbers multiplied by something? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 29 +29 =58, output is 58. So maybe it's just the sum.\n\nSecond input: 20 +68=88, which is the output. Third: 43 +51=94, which is the output. Fourth: 37 +49=86, which is the output. Fifth:5 +8=13, which is the output.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers in each input.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably to add the two numbers given.\n\nLet me just verify each:\n\n1. 29 +29 =58 ✅\n2. 20 +68=88 ✅\n3. 43 +51=94 ✅\n4. 37 +49=86 ✅\n5. 5 +8=13 ✅\n\nYes, all match. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: take the two numbers and add them together.\n\nSo the instruction is probably \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible pattern. Maybe it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's check the last one: 5 and 8 sum to 13, which is correct. 5+8=13.\n\nSo yes, it's consistently the sum.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an operation, it's the sum of the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the rule is a + b = c.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Input: 2 50 → Output: 52\n4. Input: 29 55 → Output: 84\n5. Input: 33 83 → Output: 116\n\nFirst, let's list them again:\n\n1. (12, 99) → 111\n2. (29, 33) → 62\n3. (2, 50) → 52\n4. (29, 55) → 84\n5. (33, 83) → 116\n\nI need to find a pattern or operation that transforms the two numbers into the output.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else.\n\nLet's look at the first pair: Input 12 and 99, output 111.\n\nWhat's 12 + 99? That's 111. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check if this holds for other inputs.\n\nSecond pair: Input 29 and 33. If I add them: 29 + 33 = 62. Which matches the output 62. Interesting.\n\nThird pair: Input 2 and 50. 2 + 50 = 52. Output is 52. That works too.\n\nFourth pair: Input 29 and 55. 29 + 55 = 84. Output is 84. Perfect.\n\nFifth pair: Input 33 and 83. 33 + 83 = 116. Output is 116. Also matches.\n\nWait, so it seems like the rule is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 12 + 99 = 111 ✔️\n2. 29 + 33 = 62 ✔️\n3. 2 + 50 = 52 ✔️\n4. 29 + 55 = 84 ✔️\n5. 33 + 83 = 116 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs.

Nope.\n2. 29*33=957 ≠62. Nope.\nSo addition seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, subtraction? 99 - 12 = 87 ≠111. Doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about absolute difference? |12 -99|=87≠111. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 12*99 - something? 12*99=1188, 1188 - 777=411≠111. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, concatenation? 12 concatenated with 99 is 1299, which isn't 111. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, sum of squares? 12² +99² is way bigger than 111. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, 12* something +99* something? Let's see:\n\n12* something +99* something = 111.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote the rule as a*input1 + b*input2 = output.\n\nSo:\n\n12a +99b = 111\n\n29a +33b =62\n\n2a +50b=52\n\n29a +55b=84\n\n33a +83b=116\n\nWe can set up equations to find a and b.\n\nBut this might get complicated.

Let's compute 70*69=4830, 4*69=276, so 74*69=5106, so -5106b\n\nThen 26*83b=2158b\n\nSo overall:\n\n7030 -5106b +2158b =157*26\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n7030 - (5106 -2158)b =7030 -2948b\n\nRight side:157*26. 150*26=3900, 7*26=182, total 4082.\n\nSo:\n\n7030 -2948b =4082\n\nSubtract 7030 both sides:\n\n-2948b =4082 -7030= -2948\n\nThus:\n\n-2948b = -2948  \nSo b=1\n\nThen plug back into Equation1:\n\n26a +69*1=95  \n26a=95 -69=26  \na=1\n\nSo a=1, b=1.\n\nLet me check if this works with Equation3:\n\n92a +97b =92*1 +97*1= 92+97=189. Which matches the output. Good.\n\nCheck Equation4:34a +69b=34*1 +69*1=103. Correct.\n\nEquation5:24a +75b=24*1 +75*1=99. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is output = 1*first input +1*second input. So output = input1 + input2.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers together.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the inputs into outputs. Let me list them again:\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n\n1. Input: 61 92 → Output: 153\n2. Input: 34 42 → Output: 76\n3. Input: 10 58 → Output: 68\n4. Input: 25 44 → Output: 69\n5. Input: 7 94 → Output: 101\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, say a and b, and the output is some function of a and b. Let me denote the inputs as a and b, and outputs as c.\n\nLooking at the first pair: Input 61 and 92 gives output 153.\n\nLet me consider possible operations. Maybe addition? 61 + 92 = 153. Wait, 61 + 92 is indeed 153. Let me check the next pair.\n\nSecond input: 34 and 42. 34 + 42 = 76. Which matches the output 76. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 10 and 58. 10 + 58 = 68. Which is the output given. So far, it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nLet's check the fourth input: 25 and 44. 25 + 44 = 69. Which matches the output 69.\n\nFifth input: 7 and 94. 7 + 94 = 101. Which is the given output. Wow, so it seems consistent.\n\nWait, so is the instruction just adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 61 + 92 = 153 ✔️\n2. 34 + 42 = 76 ✔️\n3. 10 + 58 = 68 ✔️\n4. 25 + 44 = 69 ✔️\n5. 7 + 94 = 101 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 61*92 = 5612, which is not 153. So nope, addition seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe concatenation? 61 concatenated with 92 is 6192, which isn't 153. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, subtracting: 92 - 61 = 31, not 153. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 61*2.5 = 153? Wait, 61* something? 61*2.524 ≈ 153, but not a clean operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 6^1 + 9^2? Wait 6^1 is 6, 9^2 is 81, sum is 87, not 153.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe each number is split into digits and added separately? Let's try:\n\nFirst input: 61 and 92.\n\n61: 6 + 1 =7; 92:9 +2=11; sum 7+11=18 ≠153. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 6*1 + 9*2=6 +18=24≠153.\n\nNot likely.\n\nAlternatively, 61* something. 61*2.5 = 152.99≈153. Maybe multiply the first number by something related to the second.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n153,76,68,69,101.\n\nWait 153 is 61*2 + 31? Not sure.\n\nWait let's think about the outputs:\n\n153 is 1+5+3=9, but not sure.\n\nWait let me list all the outputs:\n\n153,76,68,69,101.\n\nWait 153 is 61*2 + 31? Wait 61*2=122 +11=133 no. Maybe 61*2 + something.\n\nWait let me think of another approach. Maybe it's a function like a^3 + b^3? 61^3 is way too big, 61^3 is 226,  something else.\n\nWait let me just stick with the initial observation that it's simply a + b.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n61 +92=153, yes.\n\n34 +42=76, yes.\n\n10 +58=68, yes.\n\n25 +44=69, yes.\n\n7 +94=101, yes.\n\nSo all the outputs are the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: take the two numbers and output their sum.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"sum the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all the examples:\n\nFirst input: 61 and 92: 61 +92=153. Output is 153. Correct.\n\nSecond input:34 +42=76. Output is76. Correct.\n\nThird:10 +58=68. Output is68. Correct.\n\nFourth:25 +44=69. Output is69. Correct.\n\nFifth:7 +94=101. Output is101. Correct.\n\nSo yes, it's simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nThe final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply the sum.\n\n\\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the specific instruction, maybe it's \"add the two numbers.\" So the instruction is to add the first and second input numbers.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the input-output pairs... The instruction was...\" So the user is asking for the instruction, which is the rule.\n\nSo probably the rule is addition.

So for each pair (a, b), the output is some function f(a, b) = ?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=18, b=29 → Output=47\n2. a=43, b=93 → Output=136\n3. a=38, b=91 → Output=129\n4. a=84, b=99 → Output=183\n5. a=22, b=30 → Output=52\n\nI need to find a relationship between a and b to get the output.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a linear combination. Maybe something like a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me try adding a and b:\n\n18 + 29 = 47. Wait, the output is 47. That's exactly the sum of the two numbers. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 43 + 93 = 136. The output is 136. That matches.\n\nThird input: 38 + 91 = 129. Output is 129. Also matches.\n\nFourth input: 84 + 99 = 183. Output is 183. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 22 + 30 = 52. Output is 52. Also matches.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all:\n\n1. 18 + 29 = 47 ✔️\n2. 43 + 93 = 136 ✔️\n3. 38 + 91 = 129 ✔️\n4. 84 + 99 = 183 ✔️\n5. 22 + 30 = 52 ✔️\n\nWow, it seems consistent. So the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe it's a different operation like product or something else.\n\nLet me check multiplication:\n\n1. 18*29 = 522 ≠ 47. So nope.\n\nSubtraction: 29 -18=11 ≠47. Nope.\n\nMaybe a^b or something? Let's see:\n\n18^2? 18^something? 18^something? 18^something is way larger than 47.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something: 18*29=522; 522 - something =47? 522 - 475=47? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, b - a? 29 -18=11 ≠47. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think about the outputs:\n\n47, 136, 129, 183, 52.\n\nIs there another pattern? Maybe it's a function like a^2 + b or something.\n\nLet me test:\n\n1. 18^2 +29 = 324 +29=353≠47. Nope.\n\nOr a + b^2:\n\n18 +29²=18+841=859≠47. Nope.\n\nWhat about b - a? 29-18=11; 11*something=47? 11*4.27≈47, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, product of b and something.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n47, 136, 129, 183, 52.\n\nIs there a pattern in outputs? Let's see:\n\n47, 136, 129, 183, 52.\n\nWait, maybe it's alternating or something? Let me list them:\n\nFirst pair: 18,29→47\n\nSecond:43,93→136\n\nThird:38,91→129\n\nFourth:84,99→183\n\nFifth:22,30→52\n\nWait, let me check if it's a function like a* something + b* something.\n\nLet me denote output = k*a + m*b.\n\nSet up equations:\n\nFor first input: 18k +29m =47\n\nSecond:43k +93m=136\n\nThird:38k +91m=129\n\nFourth:84k +99m=183\n\nFifth:22k +30m=52\n\nWe can solve for k and m.\n\nLet me take first two equations:\n\n18k +29m =47 ...(1)\n\n43k +93m=136 ...(2)\n\nLet me solve equation 1 and 2.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 93 and equation 2 by 29:\n\n18k*93 +29m*93 =47*93\n\n43k*29 +93m*29=136*29\n\nWait, maybe it's too time-consuming. Alternatively, let me use substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1: 18k +29m =47\n\nLet me express k from equation 1:\n\n18k =47 -29m\n\nk=(47 -29m)/18\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\n43*(47 -29m)/18 +93m =136\n\nMultiply both sides by 18:\n\n43*(47 -29m) + 93m*18 =136*18\n\nCompute:\n\n43*47 = 2021\n\n43*(-29m)= -1247m\n\n93*18m=1674m\n\n136*18=2448\n\nSo:\n\n2021 -1247m +1674m =2448\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2021 + (1674m -1247m)=2448\n\n2021 + 427m =2448\n\n427m=2448 -2021=427\n\nThus m=1\n\nThen k=(47 -29*1)/18=(47-29)/18=18/18=1\n\nSo k=1, m=1\n\nCheck if this works for other equations.\n\nCheck third input:38k +91m=38*1 +91*1=129. Which matches the output 129.\n\nFourth input:84k +99m=84*1 +99*1=183. Which matches the output.\n\nFifth input:22k +30m=22*1 +30*1=52. Which matches the output.\n\nWow! So the formula is output = a + b.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\n1. 18 +29=47 ✔️\n\n2. 43 +93=136 ✔️\n\n3. 38 +91=129 ✔️\n\n4. 84 +99=183 ✔️\n\n5.22 +30=52 ✔️\n\nYes, all match.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

So, we have four pairs:\n\n1. Input: 52 68, Output: 120\n2. Input: 61 96, Output: 157\n3. Input: 14 95, Output: 109\n4. Input: 12 96, Output: 108\n5. Input: 26 58, Output: 84\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. 52 68 → 120\n2. 61 96 → 157\n3. 14 95 → 109\n4. 12 96 → 108\n5. 26 58 → 84\n\nHmm, let's consider possible operations. Maybe it's something like multiplication or addition or some formula.\n\nLet me look for a pattern. Maybe it's a function of the two numbers a and b resulting in some combination.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=52, b=68 → c=120\n2. a=61, b=96 → c=157\n3. a=14, b=95 → c=109\n4. a=12, b=96 → c=108\n5. a=26, b=58 → c=84\n\nLet me try different operations:\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a sum: a + b? 52+68=120. Hey, that's the first output! Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 61 + 96 = 157, which matches the second output. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 14 + 95 = 109, which matches the third output. Fourth input: 12 + 96 = 108, which is the fourth output. Fifth input: 26 + 58 = 84. Wait, 26 + 58 is indeed 84. So all these outputs match the sum of the two numbers!\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify:\n\nFirst input: 52 + 68 = 120, which is the output. Second: 61 + 96 = 157, correct. Third: 14 + 95 = 109, correct. Fourth: 12 + 96 = 108, correct. Fifth: 26 + 58 = 84, correct.\n\nSo it seems the instruction is simply adding the two input numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \"sum the two numbers.\"\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 52*68 = 3536, which is not 120. So nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 52*68=3536, which is way larger than 120. Not likely.\n\nWhat about a formula like a^b or something? 52^something? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by b minus something. Let's try:\n\nFor first input: 52*68 = 3536. 3536 minus something? 3536 - 2336 = 120? Wait, 3536 - 120* something? Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if it's a combination like a squared plus b or something.\n\n52^2 = 2704, 68^2=4624. 2704 + 4624 is way more than 120. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n120, 157, 109, 108, 84.\n\nIs there another relation? Maybe it's a function like a* something plus b* something.\n\nLet me consider linear combination: c = p*a + q*b.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor first input: 52p + 68q = 120\n\nSecond: 61p + 96q = 157\n\nThird: 14p +95q = 109\n\nFourth: 12p +96q = 108\n\nFifth:26p +58q =84\n\nWe can try solving these equations to find p and q.\n\nBut this might take time. Let's try the first two equations:\n\nEquation 1: 52p +68q = 120\n\nEquation 2:61p +96q =157\n\nLet me solve for p and q.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 61 and equation 2 by 52:\n\nWait, maybe use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 61:\n\n52*61 p +68*61 q = 120*61\n\n3172p + 4148q = 7320\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 52:\n\n61*52 p +96*52 q =157*52\n\n3172p + 4992q = 8164\n\nSubtract first modified equation from the second:\n\n(3172p + 4992q) - (3172p + 4148q) = 8164 -7320\n\n(0p) + 844q = 844\n\nThus 844q = 844 => q=1\n\nThen plug back into equation 1:\n\n52p +68*1=120\n\n52p +68=120\n\n52p=52\n\np=1\n\nSo p=1, q=1. Let's check if this works for the third input:\n\n14*1 +95*1= 14+95=109. Which matches the output. Good.\n\nCheck fourth input:12*1 +96*1=108. Output is 108. Correct.\n\nFifth input:26*1 +58*1=26+58=84. Output is 84. Correct.\n\nWow! So the formula is c = a + b. Because p=1 and q=1, so c = 1*a +1*b = a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\nFirst input:52 +68=120. Correct.\n\nSecond:61+96=157. Correct.\n\nThird:14+95=109. Correct.\n\nFourth:12+96=108. Correct.\n\nFifth:26+58=84. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum them. The instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: The output is the sum of the two input numbers. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition.

Maybe it's an arithmetic operation? Let's check addition first.\n\nFirst pair: 63 + 88 = 151. Oh! The output is exactly 151. So maybe it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the next one: Input 14 + 94 = 108. Yep, that's the output given. So far, it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nLet's test the third input: 9 + 22 = 31. The output is 31. That matches too.\n\nFourth input: 69 + 89 = 158. The output is indeed 158. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 65 + 66 = 131. The output is 131. That also works.\n\nWait, so is the instruction just adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 63 + 88 = 151 ✔️\n2. 14 + 94 = 108 ✔️\n3. 9 + 22 = 31 ✔️\n4. 69 + 89 = 158 ✔️\n5. 65 + 66 = 131 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So maybe the instruction was simply to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 63*88 = 5544, which is not 151. So nope, addition is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, subtraction? 88 - 63 = 25, not 151. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe multiplication of the two numbers minus something? 63*88 = 5544, which is not 151. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, concatenation? 63 concatenated with 88 is 6388, which isn't 151. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, sum of squares? 63² + 88²? 3969 + 7744 = 11713, nope.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 63*2 + 88? 126 + 88 = 214, not 151.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's a function like a*input1 + b*input2 + c. Let's see if it's a linear combination.\n\nLet me denote the output as a*63 + b*88 = 151 for first input.\n\nSimilarly for other inputs:\n\n14a +94b = 108\n\n9a +22b =31\n\n69a +89b =158\n\n65a +66b =131\n\nWe can set up equations:\n\nEquation 1: 63a +88b = 151\n\nEquation 2:14a +94b = 108\n\nEquation 3:9a +22b =31\n\nEquation 4:69a +89b =158\n\nEquation 5:65a +66b =131\n\nLet me try solving the first three equations to find a and b.\n\nFrom equation 3: 9a +22b =31\n\nLet me solve equation 3 for a:\n\n9a = 31 -22b\n\na = (31 -22b)/9\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\n14*( (31 -22b)/9 ) +94b =108\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\n14*(31 -22b) + 846b = 972\n\n434 - 308b +846b =972\n\n434 + 538b =972\n\n538b = 972 -434 =538\n\nSo 538b=538 → b=1\n\nThen from equation 3: 9a +22*1=31 →9a=9→a=1\n\nSo a=1, b=1\n\nCheck equation 1: 63*1 +88*1=63+88=151.

Let's look for patterns here.\n\nFirst, let's consider basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or maybe something else like concatenation or some function.\n\nLet's take the first pair: Input 31 and 51, output 82.\n\nLet me try adding them: 31 + 51 = 82.

Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=55, b=72 → c=127\n2. a=32, b=51 → c=83\n3. a=12, b=25 → c=37\n4. a=2, b=30 → c=32\n5. a=40, b=85 → c=125\n\nI need to find a formula that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, etc.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a linear combination. Maybe c = a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me try c = a + b + something.\n\nCompute a + b for each input:\n\n1. 55 +72=127. Hey, that's exactly the output. So 55+72=127. Let me check the next one.\n\n2. 32 +51=83. Which matches the output 83. Interesting.\n\n3. 12 +25=37. Which is the output. Wow, that works.\n\n4. 2 +30=32. Output is 32. Perfect.\n\n5. 40 +85=125. Output is 125. Perfect again.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 55 +72 = 127 ✔️\n2. 32 +51=83 ✔️\n3. 12 +25=37 ✔️\n4. 2 +30=32 ✔️\n5. 40 +85=125 ✔️\n\nWow, it seems consistent. So the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe it's a different operation.\n\nLet me check multiplication: 55*72 is way bigger than 127, so no.\n\nWhat about a^b or something? 55^something? Probably not.\n\nLet me try subtraction: 72 -55=17, not 127. Doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about a squared plus b? 55² is 3025, plus 72? No, way too big. Maybe a multiplied by something.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first pair: 55 and 72 sum to 127, which is the output. Similarly, 32 +51=83, etc. It seems consistent.\n\nLet me check the other pairs:\n\nFor input 12 25: 12 +25=37, which is the output. Similarly, 2 +30=32, and 40 +85=125. So yes, it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\n1. 55 +72 = 127: correct.\n2. 32 +51=83: correct.\n3. 12 +25=37: correct.\n4. 2 +30=32: correct.\n5. 40 +85=125: correct.\n\nYes, all outputs match the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe a^something or something else.\n\nWait, let's check if it's a*b + something.\n\n1. 55*72= 3960, which is not 127. So no.\n\nWhat about a^2 + b? 55²=3025 +72=3097≠127. Nope.\n\nOr b^2 +a? 72²=5184 +55=5239≠127. Nope.\n\nMaybe a multiplied by b minus something.\n\n55*72=3960. 3960 minus something? 3960 - 2733=127? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a + b - something.\n\n55 +72=127, so 55+72 - something=127? 55+72=127, so subtract 0? Maybe it's just a + b.\n\nYes, seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all inputs:\n\nFirst input: 55 and72 → 55+72=127. Correct.\n\nSecond:32+51=83. Correct.\n\nThird:12+25=37. Correct.\n\nFourth:2+30=32. Correct.\n\nFifth:40+85=125. Correct.\n\nYes, all match.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the rule in words or something? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"What was the instruction?\" and the user provided the instruction and the five inputs. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs.

So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the specific operation, maybe it's written as \"add the two numbers\" or \"sum the two numbers.\"\n\nBut since it's an instruction, probably stating it as \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo probably the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nThus, the instruction is the sum of the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply the sum. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the instruction was...\" and gave five pairs.

So the rule is the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut let me check the exact wording. The user says \"the instruction was\" and gave the pairs.

That matches.\n\n3. 65 +76=141, which is the output. 65+76=141. Yep, that works.\n\n4. 25 +68=93, which is the output. 25+68=93. Correct.\n\n5. 37 +97=134, which is the output. 37+97=134.

Let's list out the inputs and outputs again:\n\n1. Input: 44 65 → Output: 109\n2. Input: 46 73 → Output: 119\n3. Input: 28 41 → Output: 69\n4. Input: 76 97 → Output: 173\n5. Input: 15 99 → Output: 114\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation on the two numbers. Let's consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nFirst pair: 44 and 65 give 109.\n\nLet me try adding them: 44 + 65 = 109. Oh! That gives exactly the output. Let me check if this works for all.\n\nSecond input: 46 and 73. 46 + 73 = 119. Which matches the output 119. Nice.\n\nThird input: 28 and 41. 28 + 41 = 69. Yep, that's the output given.\n\nFourth input: 76 and 97. Let's add them: 76 + 97 = 173. Which is the output given. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 15 and 99. 15 + 99 = 114. That's exactly the output provided.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 44 + 65 = 109 ✔️\n2. 46 + 73 = 119 ✔️\n3. 28 + 41 = 69 ✔️\n4. 76 + 97 = 173 ✔️\n5. 15 + 99 = 114 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two numbers in each input pair. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers together.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 44*65 = 2860, which is not 109. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 65 - 44 = 21, not 109. Nope.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 44* something? 44*2.477≈109? Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe concatenation? 44 and 65 concatenated is 4465, but that's way bigger than 109. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 44 + 65 = 109, which is the output. So seems like it's just addition.\n\nLet me check the last one again: 15 + 99 = 114, which is correct.\n\nSo it's consistent. Therefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output = first input + second input.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

I have four input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let me list them again:\n\nInput: 3 59 Output: 62  \nInput: 33 48 Output: 81  \nInput: 16 87 Output: 103  \nInput: 53 81 Output: 134  \nInput: 52 80 Output: 132\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation like addition, multiplication, something else.\n\nFirst pair: Input 3 and 59 gives 62. Let's see: 3 + 59 = 62. Oh, that's exactly the output. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 33 and 48. If I add them: 33 + 48 = 81. Hey, that's the output given, 81. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 16 and 87. 16 + 87 = 103. That's the output given as 103. So far, it seems like it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nFourth input: 53 and 81. Let's add them: 53 + 81 = 134. Which matches the output of 134.\n\nFifth input: 52 and 80. 52 + 80 = 132. Which is the given output. So all outputs are just the sum of the two numbers.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply \"add the two numbers\"? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 3 + 59 = 62 ✔️\n2. 33 + 48 = 81 ✔️\n3. 16 + 87 = 103 ✔️\n4. 53 + 81 = 134 ✔️\n5. 52 + 80 = 132 ✔️\n\nAll match perfectly. So maybe the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 3*59 = 177 ≠ 62. Nope.\n\nSubtraction? 59 - 3 = 56 ≠62. Not that either.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 3*59=177, 177 - something? 177 - 115=62? Doesn't seem obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 3 and 59 make 359? No, output is 62. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 3^something? 3^something? 3^something plus something? Maybe 3* something plus 59? Let's see:\n\n3* something +59 =62. 3x +59=62 → 3x=3 →x=1. Maybe not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, 59 - 3* something? 59 - 3* something =62? 59 - something*3=62 → something*3= -3 → not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the two numbers minus something? 3*59=177. 177 minus 115=62. Not sure.\n\nBut since all the outputs match the sum, it's more likely the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the other way. Maybe it's the product of the two numbers minus something:\n\nFirst input: 3*59=177. 177 minus 115=62. Maybe 115 is 3 + something? 3 + 59=62, which is the output. Wait, the output is 62, which is the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second? Let's see:\n\n3 * something + 59 =62. 3x +59=62 → 3x=3 →x=1. So instruction could be 1*3 +59? Maybe not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the second number minus something times the first:\n\n59 - (something*3)=62? 59 - something*3=62 → -something*3=3 → something= -1. Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the digits of each number? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 3 and 59. Sum of digits: 3 + (5+9)=3+14=17. Not 62.\n\nNot likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the digits? 3*59=177, which isn't 62.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference between the squares? 59² - 3²= 3481 -9=3472≠62. Nope.\n\nWait, let's go back. Since all outputs are equal to the sum of the two numbers in each case, it seems the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify each:\n\nFirst input: 3 + 59 =62 ✓\n\nSecond:33 +48=81 ✓\n\nThird:16 +87=103 ✓\n\nFourth:53 +81=134 ✓\n\nFifth:52 +80=132 ✓\n\nYes, all match.

Maybe it's b? If first input is (a,b), output is b. Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 0 and 41, output 41. That works.\n\nSecond input: 58 and72, output130. 72≠130. So no.\n\nAlternatively, a + b - something? Let's see:\n\nFirst: 0 +41=41. Output is 41. So maybe a + b if a is 0, but if a isn't zero, maybe something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n41, 130,77,132,128.\n\nIs there another pattern?

Maybe it's addition? Let's check if this holds for other pairs.\n\nSecond pair: 91 and 97. If we add them: 91 + 97 = 188. Hey, that's exactly the output given: 188. Interesting, so maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the next pair: 41 and 64. Adding them: 41 + 64 = 105. Which matches the output of 105. Nice, that works.\n\nNext pair: 43 and 77. Adding them: 43 + 77 = 120. The output is 120, which matches. Good.\n\nLast pair: 27 and 53. Adding them: 27 + 53 = 80.

Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's concatenation? 18 concatenated with 18 is 1818, which is way more than 36. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 18*2=36, but why 2? Maybe the number of something? Or perhaps it's the product of the digits? 1*8 + 1*8? 8 + 8=16≠36. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of squares? 18² + 18² = 324 + 324=648≠36. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, 18* something. 18*2=36. Maybe the second number is same as first? 18 and 18, so 18*2=36.\n\nLet me check the next pair: 91 and 97. If it's 91* something. 91*2=182≠188. Close but not exact. Maybe 91 + something else.\n\nWait, but the first case worked with addition.

Let's look for a pattern here.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible operations. Maybe addition? Let's check:\n\nFor the first input: 35 + 68 = 103. Oh! That's exactly the output. So 35 + 68 = 103. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 1 + 67 = 68. That's the output. So 1 + 67 = 68. Interesting, same as the second output.\n\nThird input: 59 + 86 = 145. Let's see: 59 + 86 is indeed 145. So that matches the output.\n\nFourth input: 55 + 85 = 140. Let's calculate 55 + 85: 55 + 85 is 140. Perfect, that's the output.\n\nFifth input: 79 + 87 = 166. Let's verify: 79 + 87 is 166. Yes, that works too.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given as input to get the output.\n\nLet me verify each case:\n\n1. 35 + 68 = 103 ✔️\n2. 1 + 67 = 68 ✔️\n3. 59 + 86 = 145 ✔️\n4. 55 + 85 = 140 ✔️\n5. 79 + 87 = 166 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two numbers. So the instruction must be to add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers given.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 35*68 = 2380, which is not 103. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 68 - 35 = 33, not 103. Plus doesn't seem likely.\n\nMaybe multiplication of the two numbers minus something? Let's see:\n\n35*68 = 2380, which is not 103. Maybe 35* something? 35*2.94... no, not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps concatenation? 35 concatenated with 68 is 3568, which is not 103. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 35 squared plus something? 35² is 1225, which is way higher than 103. Maybe 68 - 35 = 33, not 103 either.\n\nWait, but the first case works when we add them. Let me check all:\n\n1. 35 + 68 = 103 ✅\n2. 1 + 67 = 68 ✅\n3. 59 + 86 = 145 ✅\n4. 55 + 85 = 140 ✅\n5. 79 + 87 = 166 ✅\n\nAll match. So it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the other operations:\n\nWait, maybe it's something else like product minus something? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 35*68 = 2380. 2380 minus something is 103? 2380 - 2277? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, 35 squared plus 68? 35² is 1225 + 68 = 1293, not 103.\n\nAlternatively, 35 + 68 - something? 35 + 68 = 103, so maybe subtract zero? But that's trivial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 35 + (68 - something). 68 - 65 = 3? No, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 35 + 68 = 103, which is the output. So it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all the outputs:\n\n1. 35 + 68 = 103 ✅\n2. 1 + 67 = 68 ✅\n3. 59 + 86 = 145 ✅\n4. 55 + 85 = 140 ✅\n5. 79 + 87 = 166 ✅\n\nYes, all correct. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum the two numbers.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is: The instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, probably something like \"sum the two numbers\" or \"add the first and second input numbers.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

Let me list out the information again:\n\nInputs and their corresponding outputs:\n\n1. Input: 65 96 → Output: 161\n2. Input: 20 26 → Output: 46\n3. Input: 84 95 → Output: 179\n4. Input: 25 56 → Output: 81\n5. Input: 56 68 → Output: 124\n\nHmm, I need to find a relationship between the two numbers and the result. Let's denote the two numbers as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=65, b=96 → c=161\n2. a=20, b=26 → c=46\n3. a=84, b=95 → c=179\n4. a=25, b=56 → c=81\n5. a=56, b=68 → c=124\n\nI need to find an operation or formula that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst thought: Maybe it's a linear combination like c = a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me check if it's a + b, a * b, a^2 + b^2, something else.\n\nLet's test each possibility.\n\nFirst pair: 65 and 96 → 161.\n\nCompute 65 + 96 = 161. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check if this holds for all.\n\nSecond input: 20 and 26. 20 +26=46. Which matches the output 46. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 84 +95= 179. Which is the given output. So that works.\n\nFourth input:25 +56=81. Which is the output given. Perfect.\n\nFifth input:56 +68=124. Which is the output given.

Let me verify all:\n\n1. 65 +96 = 161 ✔️\n2. 20 +26 =46 ✔️\n3. 84 +95=179 ✔️\n4.25 +56=81 ✔️\n5.56 +68=124 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible formula. Maybe it's something else like a^2 + b or something? Let me check.\n\nWait, let's test the first one: 65^2 + something? 65 squared is 4225, which is way bigger than 161. So probably not squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by b? Let's check:\n\n65*96=6240, which is not 161. So no.\n\nWhat about a^2 - b? 65^2 -96=4225 -96=4129, not 161. Nope.\n\nMaybe a + b - something? 65 +96=161, so 161 -0? Maybe it's just a + b.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the second input:20 +26=46, which is the output. Third input:84 +95=179, yes. 25 +56=81, yes. 56 +68=124, yes.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me just verify each:\n\n1. 65 +96 = 161 ✅\n2. 20 +26 =46 ✅\n3. 84 +95=179 ✅\n4.25 +56=81 ✅\n5.56 +68=124 ✅\n\nYes, all correct.

Nope.\n\nAlternatively, b^2 -a: 96^2 -65=9216 -65=9151≠161. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, b -a: 96 -65=31≠161. No.\n\nAlternatively, (a + b)/something. (65+96)=161, which is the output.

Maybe it's an arithmetic operation? Let's check.\n\nFirst pair: 60 and 63. Let's see if 60 + 63 = 123? Wait, 60 + 63 is 123. Oh! That's exactly the output.

So the instruction is probably to add the two numbers given.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 60*63 is way larger than 123, so nope. Division? 60/63 is less than 1, not 123. So addition seems correct.\n\nLet me think if it's something else, like concatenation or something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the numbers:\n\nFirst input: 60 and 63. Output is 123. 60 concatenated with 63 is 6063, which is way more than 123. Not that.\n\nWait, 60 + 63 = 123. Yes, that works.\n\nSecond input: 8 and 46. 8 + 46 = 54. Correct.\n\nThird: 1 + 49 = 50.\n\nFourth: 40 + 42 = 82.\n\nFifth: 6 + 80 = 86.\n\nSo it's definitely addition. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just verify each:\n\n1. 60 + 63 = 123 ✓\n2. 8 + 46 = 54 ✓\n3. 1 + 49 = 50 ✓\n4. 40 + 42 = 82 ✓\n5. 6 + 80 = 86 ✓\n\nYep, all correct.

Input: 2 17 → Output: 19\n3. Input: 44 94 → Output: 138\n4. Input: 2 70 → Output: 72\n5. Input: 40 41 → Output: 81\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. (23, 26) → 49\n2. (2, 17) → 19\n3. (44, 94) → 138\n4. (2, 70) → 72\n5. (40, 41) → 81\n\nI need to find a function f(a, b) = c such that when I plug in these pairs, I get the outputs.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst, let's look for a formula. Maybe it's something like c = a * b or a + b or a^2 + b^2 or something else.\n\nLet's test the first pair: Input 23 and 26, output 49.\n\nIf it's a + b: 23 +26=49. Hey, that gives 49, which matches the first output. Let me check if this works for other inputs.\n\nSecond input: 2 and 17. 2 +17=19. Which matches the second output. Good.\n\nThird input: 44 and 94. 44 +94=138. That's the third output. Nice, matches.\n\nFourth input: 2 and 70. 2 +70=72. Which is the fourth output. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 40 and 41. 40 +41=81. Which is the fifth output. Wow, that works too!\n\nWait, so is it simply a + b? Let me verify all:\n\n1. 23 +26 = 49 ✔️\n2. 2 +17 =19 ✔️\n3. 44 +94=138 ✔️\n4. 2 +70=72 ✔️\n5. 40 +41=81 ✔️\n\nAll of them fit the sum of the two numbers. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possibility. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 23*26=598, which is not 49. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 26 -23=3≠49. Not likely.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 23*2=46, not 49. Maybe a different operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a^2 + b or something else.\n\nWait let's try multiplication of a and b:\n\n23*26=598≠49. Nope.\n\nWhat about a^2 + b? 23² +26=529 +26=555≠49. Nope.\n\nOr b² +a? 26² +23=676 +23=700- nope.\n\nWait, let's think of another approach. Maybe it's a function like a multiplied by something plus b multiplied by something else.\n\nLet me denote the output as c = m*a + n*b.\n\nUsing the first input: 23m +26n =49\n\nSecond input: 2m +17n=19\n\nThird input:44m +94n=138\n\nFourth input:2m +70n=72\n\nFifth input:40m +41n=81\n\nSo we have a system of equations. Let's try solving for m and n.\n\nFrom the first two equations:\n\nEquation1: 23m +26n =49\n\nEquation2: 2m +17n =19\n\nLet me solve these two.\n\nMultiply equation2 by 23: 46m + 391n = 437\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 46m +52n =98\n\nSubtract equation1*2 from equation2*23:\n\n(46m + 391n) - (46m +52n) = 437 -98\n\n46m -46m + 391n -52n = 339\n\n339n = 339\n\nSo n=1\n\nSubstitute back into equation2: 2m +17(1)=19 → 2m=2 → m=1\n\nSo m=1, n=1. Let's check if this works for the third input:\n\n44*1 +94*1=44+94=138. Yes, matches the output.\n\nFourth input:2*1 +70*1=2+70=72. Correct.\n\nFifth input:40*1 +41*1=81. Correct.\n\nWow, so it seems the formula is c = a + b. Wait, but m=1 and n=1 would mean c =1*a +1*b =a +b.

Let's look for a pattern.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nFirst pair: 57 and 72 give 129.\n\nLet me check 57 + 72 = 129. Oh! That's exactly the output.

So, I have five different input pairs and their corresponding outputs. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Input: 71 82, Output: 153\n2. Input: 2 97, Output: 99\n3. Input: 2 6, Output: 8\n4. Input: 15 19, Output: 34\n5. Input: 47 97, Output: 144\n\nI need to find a consistent rule or function that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's analyze each pair.\n\nFirst pair: Input 71 and 82 gives 153. Hmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation like sum, product, or something else.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\n- Sum of the two numbers: 71 + 82 = 153. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check if this works for other inputs.\n\nSecond input: 2 and 97. Sum would be 2 + 97 = 99. Which matches the output 99. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 2 and 6. Sum is 2 + 6 = 8. Which is the given output. So far, so good.\n\nFourth input: 15 and 19. Sum is 15 + 19 = 34. Which matches the output 34. Nice.\n\nFifth input: 47 and 97. Sum is 47 + 97 = 144. Which is exactly the given output 144.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 71 + 82 = 153 ✔️\n2. 2 + 97 = 99 ✔️\n3. 2 + 6 = 8 ✔️\n4. 15 + 19 = 34 ✔️\n5. 47 + 97 = 144 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs.

Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 71*82 = 5822, which is not 153. So nope, addition seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps concatenation? 71 and 82 concatenated is 7182, but that's way bigger than 153. So no.\n\nAlternatively, difference? 82 -71=11, not 153. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 71*2=142, not 153. 71* something else? 71*2 + something? 71*2=142, 142 +11=153. Maybe not a straightforward formula.\n\nBut since all the outputs match the sum, I think it's safe to conclude it's addition.\n\nLet me just verify each case again:\n\n1. 71 +82 = 153: Correct.\n2. 2 +97=99: Correct.\n3. 2 +6=8: Correct.\n4. 15 +19=34: Correct.\n5. 47 +97=144: Correct.\n\nYes, all of them add up.

Input: 12 50, Output: 62\n5. Input: 23 23, Output: 46\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and the output is a single number. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLooking for a pattern between a, b and c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=13, b=79, c=92\n2. a=36, b=36, c=72\n3. a=3, b=89, c=92\n4. a=12, b=50, c=62\n5. a=23, b=23, c=46\n\nI need to find a function or rule that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst, let's look for a simple arithmetic operation. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else.\n\nLet me check if it's a sum: a + b? Let's see:\n\n1. 13 +79=92. Oh! That's the first output. So 13+79=92. That matches.\n\n2. 36 +36=72. Output is 72. That matches.\n\n3. 3 +89=92. Output is 92. Also matches.\n\n4. 12 +50=62. Output is 62. Perfect.\n\n5. 23 +23=46. Output is 46. Also matches.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 13 +79 = 92 ✔️\n2. 36 +36 =72 ✔️\n3. 3 +89=92 ✔️\n4. 12 +50=62 ✔️\n5. 23 +23=46 ✔️\n\nWow, all outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's a different combination like a multiplied by something or b multiplied or something else.\n\nLet me check multiplication:\n\n1. 13*79=1027, which is not 92. So no.\n\nSubtraction: 79-13=66 ≠92? Wait, 92 is bigger. Maybe 13* something? 13*7=91, close but not 92.\n\nAlternatively, 79 - something? 79 - 13* something? Maybe 13*7=91, plus 1 is 92. But that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, 13* something plus something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a function like a multiplied by b divided by something? Let's check:\n\n1. 13*79=1027, divided by something? 1027 / something =92. 1027 / 11.3 something, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, 13* something else. 13*7=91, close to 92. Maybe 13*7 +1=92. But then input b is 79, not 7. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a + b - something. 13 +79=92, so maybe it's just a + b. That works for all.\n\nLet me check the second input: 36 +36=72, which is the output. Third input: 3 +89=92, same as first. Fourth:12 +50=62, which is 62. Fifth:23 +23=46. Yep, all add up.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction must be \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nLet me just verify each case:\n\n1. 13 +79 =92 ✅\n2. 36 +36=72 ✅\n3. 3 +89=92 ✅\n4. 12 +50=62 ✅\n5. 23 +23=46 ✅\n\nYes, all correct.

Therefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be represented as \\boxed{a + b}.\n\nWait, but let me read the problem again. It says \"the instruction\" was... So probably it's an explicit formula or a specific operation.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's check multiplication:\n\n1. 13*79=1027≠92\n\n2. 36*36=1296≠72\n\nNope, not multiplication.\n\nSubtraction: 79 -13=66≠92\n\nNope.\n\nMaybe a*b - something.\n\n1. 13*79=1027, 1027 - 100=927? No, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, 79 -13=66, not 92.\n\nAlternatively, 13*7=91, plus 1=92. Maybe (a- something)*b? 13- something? 13*7=91 +1=92. Maybe (a- something)*b? Not sure.\n\nBut since all other operations don't fit except addition, I think it's safe to assume it's addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the answer is: The instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as an operation, it's simply the sum.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst pair: Input (1, 13) gives Output 14.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\n1. Sum: a + b? 1 +13=14. Hey, that gives 14, which matches the output. Let's check the next pair.\n\nSecond pair: Input (31,32). Sum is 31+32=63. Output is 63. That matches too.\n\nThird pair: Input (52,67). Sum is 52+67=119. Output is 119.

No, not quite.\n\nWhat about a function like a* something or b* something?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first pair: 1 and 13 gives 14.

But since all outputs match the sum, it's likely the rule is simply a + b.\n\nLet me test the last pair:\n\nInput: 8 and 63. Sum is 71, which is the output. Yep, that works.\n\nSo it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else, like max(a,b) or min(a,b) or something else.\n\nFirst input: max(1,13)=13≠14  \nSecond input: max(31,32)=32≠63  \nNope, not max.\n\nWhat about min(a,b)+ something? min(1,13)=1, 1 + something=14→ something=13. Maybe a + b? 1+13=14, yes.\n\nThird input: min(52,67)=52, 52 + something=119→ something=67. So maybe min + max? 52 +67=119. That works for third input.\n\nFourth input: min(53,57)=53, 53 + something=110→ something=57. So min + max again? 53 +57=110. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: min(8,63)=8, 8 + something=71→ something=63. So yes, min + max again. 8 +63=71.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: take the minimum of the two numbers and add the maximum. So the instruction is to take the minimum of a and b and add the maximum of a and b.\n\nLet me formalize it: min(a,b) + max(a,b) = a + b, which is just the sum. So essentially, it's the sum of the two numbers regardless.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\n1. min(1,13)=1; max=13; sum=14 ✔️  \n2. min(31,32)=31; max=32; sum=63 ✔️  \n3. min(52,67)=52; max=67; sum=119 ✔️  \n4. min(53,57)=53; max=57; sum=110 ✔️  \n5. min(8,63)=8; max=63; sum=71 ✔️\n\nYes, all match. So the rule is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding both inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be something like \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: add the first input and the second input.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to sum the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Maybe it's an arithmetic operation or something with addition or multiplication.\n\nLet me consider possible operations. Maybe it's the sum of the two numbers multiplied or something else.\n\nLet's take the first pair: Input 62 and 86, output 148.\n\nIf I add them: 62 + 86 = 148. Oh! That gives exactly the output. Let me check if this holds for all.\n\nSecond input: 17 and 76. 17 +76 = 93. Which matches the output 93. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 24 +45 = 69. Yep, that's the output given.\n\nFourth input: 3 +9 =12. Output is 12, which matches.\n\nFifth input: 27 +96 = 123. Output is 123. Perfect, that works too.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 62 +86 = 148 ✔️\n2. 17 +76 =93 ✔️\n3. 24 +45 =69 ✔️\n4. 3 +9 =12 ✔️\n5. 27 +96 =123 ✔️\n\nSo it seems consistent. Therefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given as input.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's concatenation or something else? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first input: 62 and 86. If we concatenate them, it would be 6286, but output is 148, which is not that. If we reverse them: 62 reversed is 26, 86 reversed is 68, 26 +68=94, not 148. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, multiply the two numbers:\n\n62*86 = 5332, which is not 148. So addition seems more likely.\n\nLet me check another possibility: subtracting the numbers or something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n62 and 86: 86 -62 =24, not 148.\n\nAlternatively, 6*2 +8*6 = 12 +48=60, not 148.\n\nAlternatively, 6^2 + 2*8*6? 36 + 96=132, not 148.\n\nNot sure. Maybe it's the product of the digits? Let's try:\n\nFor 62 and 86:\n\nDigits: 6,2 and 8,6.\n\nProduct: 6*2=12, 8*6=48; 12+48=60, not 148.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, sum of squares: 6² +2² +8² +6²= 36+4+64+36=140, not 148.\n\nClose but not exact.\n\nWait, but the first case gives 148, which is 62 + 86. Let me check the other outputs:\n\nSecond input: 17 and76. 17 +76=93, which is the output. Similarly, 24 +45=69, etc. So it seems consistent with simple addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all:\n\n62 +86 = 148 ✔️\n\n17 +76 =93 ✔️\n\n24 +45=69 ✔️\n\n3 +9=12 ✔️\n\n27 +96=123 ✔️\n\nYes, all match.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Input: 12 47, Output: 59\n2. Input: 17 44, Output: 61\n3. Input: 82 94, Output: 176\n4. Input: 48 55, Output: 103\n5. Input: 2 65, Output: 67\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation? Let's check.\n\nFirst pair: 12 and 47 give 59.\n\nLet me try adding them: 12 + 47 = 59. Oh! That gives the output. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 17 + 44 = 61. Which matches the output 61. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 82 + 94 = 176. Yep, that's the output given. 176.\n\nFourth input: 48 + 55 = 103. Output is 103. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 2 + 65 = 67. Output is 67. That also matches.\n\nWait, so is it just adding the two numbers? Let me verify all:\n\n1. 12 + 47 = 59 ✔️\n2. 17 + 44 = 61 ✔️\n3. 82 + 94 = 176 ✔️\n4. 48 + 55 = 103 ✔️\n5. 2 + 65 = 67 ✔️\n\nWow, seems consistent. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n1. 12*47 = 564 ≠59. Nope, not multiplication.\n\nSubtraction? 47 -12=35≠59. Nope.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 12* something? 12*something + something? Let's see:\n\n12 and 47: 12*something + something =59. Let me set up equations:\n\nLet me denote the rule as a*input1 + b*input2 = output.\n\nSo for first input: 12a + 47b =59\n\nSecond:17a +44b=61\n\nThird:82a +94b=176\n\nFourth:48a +55b=103\n\nFifth:2a +65b=67\n\nWe can set up equations to find a and b.\n\nLet me take the first two equations:\n\n12a +47b =59\n\n17a +44b =61\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nMultiply first equation by 17 and second by 12:\n\n12*17a +47*17b =59*17\n\n17*12a +44*17b =61*12\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to subtract or use substitution.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(17a +44b) - (12a +47b) =61 -59\n\n5a -3b =2\n\nSo 5a -3b =2. Equation (1)\n\nSimilarly, let's take the third equation:\n\n82a +94b =176\n\nLet me simplify it. Maybe divide by 2: 41a +47b =88\n\nEquation (3): 41a +47b =88\n\nNow from equation (1): 5a -3b =2\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nLet me express a from equation (1):\n\n5a = 2 +3b\n\na = (2 +3b)/5\n\nPlug into equation 3:\n\n41*( (2 +3b)/5 ) +47b =88\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n41*(2 +3b) +235b =440\n\n82 + 123b +235b =440\n\n82 + 358b =440\n\n358b = 440 -82 =358\n\nSo 358b=358 => b=1\n\nThen from equation (1): 5a -3(1)=2 =>5a=5 =>a=1\n\nSo a=1, b=1. Let's check if this works for the other equations.\n\nCheck the fourth input: 48a +55b =48*1 +55*1=103. Which matches the output. Good.\n\nCheck the fifth input:2a +65b=2*1 +65*1=67. Which matches the output. Perfect.\n\nSo the rule is output = 1*input1 +1*input2.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\n1. 12 +47=59 ✔️\n\n2.17+44=61 ✔️\n\n3.82+94=176 ✔️\n\n4.48+55=103 ✔️\n\n5.2+65=67 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.

Maybe addition? 28 + 32 = 60. Hey, that gives exactly the output. Let me check the next pair.\n\nSecond pair: 36 + 46 = 82. The output is 82, which matches. Hmm, interesting.\n\nThird pair: 33 + 89 = 122. Output is 122. That also matches.\n\nFourth pair: 48 + 83 = 131. Output is 131. Perfect.\n\nFifth pair: 36 + 63 = 99. Output is 99. That also works.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers?

So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n28 * 32 = 896, which is not 60. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 32 - 28 = 4, not 60. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 28* something? 28* something plus something else? Let's see:\n\n28 + 32 = 60. Maybe it's the sum.\n\nWait, let's check the other pairs:\n\n36 + 46 = 82, yes.\n\n33 + 89 = 122, yes.\n\n48 + 83 = 131, yes.\n\n36 + 63 = 99, yes.\n\nSo it seems consistent. So perhaps the instruction is simply to add the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else. Maybe it's concatenation? 28 and 32 concatenated is 2832, but 2832 is way bigger than 60. So no.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 28* something? 28* something plus something else.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's the sum of the digits?\n\nFirst input: 28 and 32.\n\nSum of digits of 28 is 2+8=10, sum of 32 is 3+2=5. 10 +5=15, not 60. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, product of the sum of digits:\n\n(2+8)*(3+2)=10*5=50, not 60.\n\nAlternatively, product of the numbers: 28*32=896, not 60.\n\nNot likely.\n\nAlternatively, difference? 32 -28=4, not 60.\n\nWait, maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second? Let's see:\n\nFor first input: 28 32 → 28* something + something.\n\nLet me denote output = a*input1 + b*input2.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\n28a + 32b = 60\n\n36a +46b =82\n\n33a +89b=122\n\n48a +83b=131\n\n36a +63b=99\n\nThis might be a system of equations. Let's try solving the first two:\n\nEquation 1: 28a +32b =60\n\nEquation 2: 36a +46b=82\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 84a +96b = 180\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 72a +92b = 164\n\nSubtract:\n\n(84a -72a) + (96b -92b) = 180 -164\n\n12a +4b =16\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 3a + b =4 --> Equation 3: b=4 -3a\n\nPlug into equation 1:\n\n28a +32b =60\n\n28a +32*(4 -3a)=60\n\n28a +128 -96a =60\n\n-68a +128=60\n\n-68a= -68\n\na=1\n\nThen b=4 -3(1)=1\n\nSo a=1, b=1.\n\nCheck with third equation:\n\n33a +89b =33*1 +89*1= 33+89=122.

Which is the given output 89.\n\nWait, so it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers given as input.\n\nLet me verify each case:\n\n1. 23 + 74 = 97 ✔️\n2. 10 + 23 = 33 ✔️\n3. 5 + 66 = 71 ✔️\n4. 11 + 64 = 75 ✔️\n5. 35 + 54 = 89 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two numbers. So the instruction must be to add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n23 * 74 = 1702, which is not 97. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 74 -23 =51 ≠97. Not that either.\n\nMaybe product of digits? Let's see:\n\n2+3=5, 7+4=11; 5*11=55 ≠97. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, concatenation? 23 concatenated with 74 is 2374, which is way bigger than 97. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the digits and add? Let's try:\n\nFirst number reversed is 32, second is 47. 32 +47=79 ≠97. Close but not 97.\n\nWait, maybe 23 reversed is 32, 74 reversed is 47. 32 +47=79 ≠97.\n\nAlternatively, 2^3 +7^4? 8 + 2401=2409 ≠97. Nope.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe it's the difference of squares? 74 -23=51≠97. 23^2 +74=529 +74=603≠97.\n\nAlternatively, 2^3 +7^4? Wait, 2^something? Maybe 2^something + something else? Maybe 2^5 + 7^something? Not sure.\n\nBut since the sum works for all cases, and it's straightforward, I think it's safe to assume it's addition.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me just confirm each case:\n\n23 +74 =97: correct.\n\n10 +23=33: correct.\n\n5 +66=71: correct.\n\n11 +64=75: correct.\n\n35 +54=89: correct.\n\nYes, all match.

So, we have four pairs:\n\n1. Input: 60 75, Output: 135\n2. Input: 67 85, Output: 152\n3. Input: 11 58, Output: 69\n4. Input: 26 91, Output: 117\n5. Input: 71 80, Output: 151\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's look for a pattern here.\n\nFirst, let's list them:\n\n1. 60 and 75 give 135\n2. 67 and 85 give 152\n3. 11 and 58 give 69\n4. 26 and 91 give 117\n5. 71 and 80 give 151\n\nI should consider different operations. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, or some combination.\n\nLet's check if it's a sum: 60 + 75 = 135. Hey, that's exactly the first output. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 67 + 85 = 152. That's the second output. Hmm, interesting. Let's check the third input: 11 + 58 = 69. Which matches the third output. Fourth input: 26 + 91 = 117. That's the fourth output. Fifth input: 71 + 80 = 151. Wait, 71 + 80 is 151, which matches the fifth output.\n\nWait, so is it just adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 60 + 75 = 135 ✔️\n2. 67 + 85 = 152 ✔️\n3. 11 + 58 = 69 ✔️\n4. 26 + 91 = 117 ✔️\n5. 71 + 80 = 151 ✔️\n\nWow, it seems consistent. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given as input to get the output.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 60*75 = 4500, which is not 135. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 75 - 60 = 15 ≠135. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 60*2.25=135? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's concatenation? 60 and 75 make 6075, but that's way bigger than 135. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 60*2 +75 = 195? No, not 135.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's the product of the two numbers divided by something.\n\n60*75 = 4500; 4500 divided by something is 135. 4500 / 34 ≈ 132.35, not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 75 - 60 =15, not 135.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n135, 152, 69, 117, 151.\n\nIs there another relation? Maybe it's the product minus something.\n\nFirst: 60*75 - something = 135. 60*75=4500; 4500 - x =135 => x=4365. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 60 + 75 = 135, which is the output. Similarly, 67 +85=152, etc. So seems like it's just addition.\n\nLet me check the third input: 11 +58=69, which is the output. Fourth input:26 +91=117, which is the output. Fifth:71 +80=151, which is correct.\n\nSo it's definitely addition of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me verify all:\n\nFirst input: 60 +75 = 135. Output is 135. Correct.\n\nSecond:67 +85=152. Correct.\n\nThird:11 +58=69. Correct.\n\nFourth:26 +91=117. Correct.\n\nFifth:71 +80=151. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible operation, like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's check the third input: 11 and 58. 11*5=55, 11* something? 11*5=55, 5* something? Wait, 11 +58=69, which is the output. So it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: the output is the sum of the two input numbers.\n\nSo instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all:\n\n60 +75=135\n\n67 +85=152\n\n11 +58=69\n\n26 +91=117\n\n71 +80=151\n\nYes, all match.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects an instruction phrase, maybe \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Input: 71 93, Output: 164\n2. Input: 47 86, Output: 133\n3. Input: 61 89, Output: 150\n4. Input: 84 96, Output: 180\n5. Input: 17 65, Output: 82\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's just adding the two numbers:\n\n1. 71 + 93 = 164. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let's check the next one.\n\n2. 47 + 86 = 133. Yep, that's the output given. Next:\n\n3. 61 + 89 = 150. Output is 150. That matches.\n\n4. 84 + 96 = 180. Output is 180. Perfect.\n\n5. 17 + 65 = 82. Wait, the output is 82. 17 + 65 is indeed 82. So all these outputs match the sum of the two numbers.\n\nWait, so is it just adding them? Let me verify each case:\n\nFirst input: 71 + 93 = 164, which is the output. Second input: 47 + 86 = 133, which is the output. Third: 61 + 89 = 150, which is the output. Fourth: 84 + 96 = 180, which is the output. Fifth: 17 + 65 = 82, which is the output.\n\nSo it seems like the rule is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else, like product or something else. 71*93 is way more than 164, so no. 47*86 is 4082, which is not 133. So addition seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction must be to add the two numbers given.\n\nLet me just confirm all:\n\n1. 71 + 93 = 164 ✔️\n2. 47 + 86 = 133 ✔️\n3. 61 + 89 = 150 ✔️\n4. 84 + 96 = 180 ✔️\n5. 17 + 65 = 82 ✔️\n\nYes, all match. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply the sum of the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: Add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be \"Add the two numbers together.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nBut let me check if it's possible it's a different operation, like concatenation or something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n164, 133, 150, 180, 82.\n\nIs there another pattern? Maybe multiplication minus something?\n\nLet me check:\n\nFirst input: 71* something? 71*2=142, not 164. 71*2 + something? 71*2=142, 142 +22=164. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 71 + 93 = 164, which is the output.\n\nWait, let me see if it's a formula like a*b - something.\n\n71*93 = 6603, which is way bigger than 164. So no.\n\nAlternatively, 93 -71=22, 22* something? 22*7.45... Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, 71 + (93 - something). Maybe 71 + 93 = 164, which is the output. So it's just adding.\n\nSame for all others, so it's addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum them.\n\nThe instruction is: Add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the instruction is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: Add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers together. So the rule is simply addition.\n\nBut let me check the last input: 17 + 65 = 82, which is indeed 17 + 65 = 82, so yes.\n\nTherefore, the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nSo, summarizing, the rule is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nExpressed as: The output is the sum of the two input numbers.\n\nBut since the user says \"the instruction was\", probably it's an operation like a + b.\n\nSo probably the rule is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is: The output is the sum of the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as: Add the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers together.

So the rule is addition.\n\nBut let me just confirm with the first input:\n\n71 + 93 = 164, which is the output.\n\nSimilarly, 47 + 86 = 133, etc. So yes, it's addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as: Add the two numbers.\n\nSo, the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo, the final answer is: The output is the sum of the two input numbers.

Input: 53 56 → Output: 109\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, say a and b, and the output is some function of a and b. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=59, b=90 → c=149\n2. a=11, b=61 → c=72\n3. a=64, b=80 → c=144\n4. a=14, b=25 → c=39\n5. a=53, b=56 → c=109\n\nI need to find a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, something else.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a linear combination. Maybe c = a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me try c = a + b + something.\n\nCompute for each case:\n\nFirst pair: 59 + 90 = 149. Oh! The output is 149. So is it just a + b?\n\nLet me check the next one:\n\nSecond input: 11 + 61 = 72, which matches the output 72. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 64 + 80 = 144, which is the output. Perfect.\n\nFourth input: 14 + 25 = 39. Wait, 14 +25 is 39. Yes, that's the output.\n\nFifth input: 53 +56 = 109. Which is the output given.

Similarly for others.\n\nWait, let me check if it's a*b or something else.\n\nFirst input: 59*90 = 5310, which is not 149. So no.\n\nWhat about b - a? 90 -59=31, not 149. No.\n\nWhat about b squared minus a? 90^2 -59=8100 -59=8041, nope.\n\nWait, maybe a squared plus b? 59² +90= 3481 +90=3571≠149. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first case: 59 +90 = 149. Second case:11 +61=72, which is the output.

Input: 74, 93; Output: 167\n5. Input: 21, 80; Output: 101\n\nHmm. Maybe it's a linear combination? Let's consider something like a * first number + b * second number + c.\n\nLet me denote the inputs as a and b, and output as c.\n\nLet me denote the first number as x and the second as y.\n\nSo for each pair:\n\n1. x=3, y=19; c=22\n2. x=85, y=94; c=179\n3. x=42, y=89; c=131\n4. x=74, y=93; c=167\n5. x=21, y=80; c=101\n\nLet me try to find a formula like c = a*x + b*y.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor first input: 3a + 19b = 22\n\nSecond input: 85a + 94b = 179\n\nThird: 42a + 89b = 131\n\nFourth:74a +93b = 167\n\nFifth:21a +80b = 101\n\nWe can try solving these equations to find a and b.\n\nLet me take the first two equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3a + 19b = 22\n\nEquation 2: 85a +94b = 179\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for a:\n\n3a = 22 -19b\n\na = (22 -19b)/3\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n85*( (22 -19b)/3 ) +94b = 179\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n85*(22 -19b) + 282b = 537\n\nCompute 85*22 = 1870; 85*(-19b) = -1615b\n\nSo 1870 -1615b +282b = 537\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1870 -1333b = 537\n\n-1333b = 537 - 1870 = -1333\n\nThus, -1333b = -1333 => b=1\n\nThen from equation 1: 3a +19*1=22 => 3a=3 => a=1\n\nSo a=1, b=1.\n\nLet me check if this works for the other equations.\n\nCheck equation 3: 42*1 +89*1 = 42 +89=131.

Input: 4 52, Output: 56\n3. Input: 40 88, Output: 128\n4. Input: 36 41, Output: 77\n5. Input: 9 37, Output: 46\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nStarting with the first pair: Input 82 and 85 give output 167. Let's see:\n\n82 + 85 = 167. Oh! That's exactly the output. So maybe it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the next pair: Input 4 and 52. If I add them: 4 + 52 = 56. Which matches the output given (56). Interesting.\n\nThird pair: 40 and 88. 40 + 88 = 128. Yep, that's the output given (128). So far, it seems like the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet's check the fourth input: 36 and 41. 36 + 41 = 77. Which is the output given (77). Perfect.\n\nLast pair: 9 and 37. 9 + 37 = 46. Which matches the output (46). So it seems consistent.\n\nWait, so is the instruction just adding the two numbers?

Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 82*85 = 6970, which is not 167. So nope, addition is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, subtraction? 85 - 82 = 3, not 167. Doesn't fit.\n\nMultiplication of the two numbers minus something? 82*85 is 6970, which is not 167. Maybe division? 85 - 82 = 3, not 167.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 82 concatenated with 85 is 8285, which isn't 167. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of squares? 82² + 85²? That would be way larger than 167. So no.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 82*2 = 164, close to 167 but not exact. Maybe 82 + 85 = 167, which is exact.\n\nSo seems consistent with addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably to add the two numbers given as input.\n\nLet me just verify all the other pairs again:\n\nSecond input: 4 and 52. 4 + 52 = 56, which is the output.

Here are the input-output pairs...\" So the instruction is the rule, which we deduced is addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nExpressed as an operation: input1 + input2.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects an instruction like \"add the two numbers,\" maybe stating it as \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nBut let me read the problem again: \"I gave a friend an instruction...\" So maybe it's a specific formula or function.\n\nGiven all the outputs match the sum of the two inputs, the instruction is addition.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nExpressed as: add the first input and the second input.\n\nSo the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be represented as the sum of the two numbers.\n\nThus, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an operation: input1 + input2.\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

So the rule is simply addition, which can be written as the sum of the two input numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}.\n\nBut since the user might expect a specific instruction phrase, perhaps stating it as \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers given as input.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be represented as the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the instruction was\" and then gave five input-output pairs. So maybe it's a specific formula like a function f(a, b) = something.\n\nGiven all the outputs are equal to a + b:\n\nFirst input: 82 +85=167, output is 167.\n\nSecond input:4 +52=56, output is56.\n\nThird:40 +88=128, output 128.\n\nAnd so on. So yes, it's simply a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b} where a and b are the inputs.\n\nBut since the problem says \"the instruction was\", probably stating it as \"add the two numbers\" is sufficient.\n\nI think the most appropriate answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers given as input.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}.\n\nWait, but the user might expect it written as an explicit instruction like \"add the first and second number\" or something. But since it's not specified, probably stating it's addition is enough.\n\nI think the answer is simply that the instruction is to add the two numbers.

Let me list out the given inputs and outputs to analyze:\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n\n1. Input: 39 84 → Output: 123\n2. Input: 31 63 → Output: 94\n3. Input: 55 72 → Output: 127\n4. Input: 11 90 → Output: 101\n5. Input: 24 92 → Output: 116\n\nI need to find a consistent mathematical operation or formula that takes two numbers and produces the third number.\n\nLet me consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, concatenation, or some combination.\n\nFirst pair: 39 and 84 give 123.\n\nLet me compute 39 + 84 = 123. Oh, that's exactly the output. Hmm, let me check the next pair.\n\nSecond input: 31 and 63. 31 + 63 = 94. Which matches the output 94. Interesting, that seems consistent.\n\nThird input: 55 and 72. 55 +72 = 127. Which is the given output. So far, it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the next ones.\n\nFourth input: 11 and 90. 11 +90 = 101. Which is the given output. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 24 and 92. 24 +92 = 116. Which matches the output given. 116.\n\nWait, so it seems like the rule is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 39 + 84 = 123 ✔️\n2. 31 + 63 = 94 ✔️\n3. 55 +72 = 127 ✔️\n4. 11 +90 = 101 ✔️\n5. 24 +92 = 116 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe concatenation? Let's check:\n\nFor example, 39 concatenated with 84 would be 3984, which is way larger than 123, so no. Or subtracting? 84 -39=45, not 123. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying? 39* something? 39*3=117, not 123. Maybe 39* something else? 39*3 + something? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a function like a^b or something else? Let's see:\n\n39^something? 39^something? 39^something? 39^something? 39^1 + something? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the concatenation of the two numbers and then subtracting something? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 39 and 84. Concatenate 3984, then subtract something? 3984 - something = 123? 3984 - 3861 = 123? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, reverse the numbers and add? 84 + 39 = 123. Wait, that's the same as adding them. So maybe the output is the concatenation of the two numbers reversed? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 39 and 84. Reverse 39 is 93, reverse 84 is 48. Concatenate 93 and 48? 9348, which is not 123. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, subtract the smaller from the larger? 84 -39=45, not 123. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 39* something plus 84? 39* something: 39*3=117, 117 + something? 117 +6=123. Maybe 3* something + something? Not sure.\n\nBut since all the outputs match the sum, I think it's safe to assume it's simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just verify each case:\n\n1. 39 +84 = 123 ✔️\n2. 31 +63=94 ✔️\n3. 55 +72=127 ✔️\n4. 11 +90=101 ✔️\n5. 24 +92=116 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers together.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Input: 65 79, Output: 144\n3. Input: 53 85, Output: 138\n4. Input: 54 88, Output: 142\n5. Input: 6 46, Output: 52\n\nHmm, let's look for a pattern here. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation or some function of the two numbers. Let's denote the two inputs as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=7, b=87, c=94\n2. a=65, b=79, c=144\n3. a=53, b=85, c=138\n4. a=54, b=88, c=142\n5. a=6, b=46, c=52\n\nI need to find a function f(a, b) = c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a sum: a + b? Let's test:\n\n1. 7 + 87 = 94. Hey, that's the first output! 94. So maybe it's just a + b?\n\nWait let's check the next one:\n\n2. 65 + 79 = 144. Yes, that's the second output. 144.\n\n3. 53 + 85 = 138. Yes, that's the third output.\n\n4. 54 + 88 = 142. Let's check: 54 + 88 is 142. Yes, that matches the output.\n\n5. 6 + 46 = 52. 6 + 46 is indeed 52. Perfect, that matches the last output.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers?

So the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication or something else.\n\nLet's check multiplication:\n\n1. 7*87 = 609 ≠94. Nope.\n\nSubtraction: 87 -7=80≠94. Not that either.\n\nMaybe a function like a multiplied by something plus b or vice versa.\n\nLet me try a * something + b:\n\nFor first input: 7 and 87, output 94.\n\nLet me see: 7 * something + 87 =94\n\n7x +87=94 => 7x=94-87=7 => x=1. So 1*a + b? Wait 1*7 +87=94. So it's 1*a + b? Let's check next input:\n\nSecond input: 65 and79, output 144.\n\n1*65 +79=65+79=144. Yes, that works.\n\nThird input:53 and85, output138.\n\n1*53 +85=53+85=138. Correct.\n\nFourth input:54 and88, 1*54 +88=142. Correct.\n\nFifth input:6 and46, 1*6 +46=52. Correct.\n\nWait, so it's simply a + b? Wait no, 1*a + b is a + b. So it's a + b.\n\nWait, 1*a + b is same as a + b. So the function is c = a + b.\n\nWait let me verify:\n\nFirst input:7 +87=94, which is the output. Second input:65 +79=144, which is the output. Third:53 +85=138, yes. Fourth:54 +88=142, yes.

Hey, that's exactly the output! 20 + 91 = 111. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 25 + 97 = 122. Output is 122. That matches.\n\nThird input: 19 + 55 = 74. Output is 74. Perfect.\n\nFourth input: 11 + 13 = 24. Output is 24. Yes, that works.\n\nFifth input: 67 + 98 = 165. Output is 165. Also matches.\n\nWait, so it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 20 + 91 = 111 ✔️\n2. 25 + 97 = 122 ✔️\n3. 19 + 55 = 74 ✔️\n4. 11 + 13 = 24 ✔️\n5. 67 + 98 = 165 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably: \"Add the two numbers together.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 20*91 = 1820 ≠ 111. Nope.\n\nSubtraction: 91 -20=71≠111. Not that either.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 20* something? 20* something + something else? Let's see:\n\nWait, let's see the outputs:\n\n111, 122, 74, 24, 165.\n\nIs there another pattern? Maybe concatenate or something else? Let's see:\n\nWait 20 and 91: 20 concatenated with 91 is 2091, which is not 111. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 20 + 91 = 111, which is the output. Similarly, 25 +97=122, etc. So it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: \"Add the two input numbers together.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all the examples:\n\n20 +91 = 111\n\n25 +97 = 122\n\n19 +55 =74\n\n11 +13=24\n\n67 +98=165\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the inputs into outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 7 82, Output: 89\n2. Input: 31 96, Output: 127\n3. Input: 15 23, Output: 38\n4. Input: 40 41, Output: 81\n5. Input: 10 46, Output: 56\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, say a and b, and the output is some function of a and b. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=7, b=82 → c=89\n2. a=31, b=96 → c=127\n3. a=15, b=23 → c=38\n4. a=40, b=41 → c=81\n5. a=10, b=46 → c=56\n\nI need to find a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, something else.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a simple sum: a + b.\n\n1. 7 + 82 = 89. Hey, that's exactly the output! Let's check the next one.\n\n2. 31 + 96 = 127. That's the output given. Okay, so far so good.\n\n3. 15 + 23 = 38. Wait, 15 +23 is 38, which matches the output. Nice.\n\n4. 40 +41 = 81. Let me check: 40 +41 is 81. Yes, that's correct.\n\n5. 10 +46 = 56. 10 +46 is 56. Perfect, that matches too.\n\nWait, so is it simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 7 +82 = 89: Correct.\n2. 31 +96 = 127: Correct.\n3. 15 +23 = 38: Correct.\n4. 40 +41 = 81: Correct.\n5. 10 +46 = 56: Correct.\n\nWow, seems like it's just adding the two numbers. So the instruction must be \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's something else like multiplication or another function.\n\nLet me check multiplication:\n\n1. 7*82 = 574 ≠89. Nope.\n\nSubtraction: 82 -7=75≠89. Not that either.\n\nWhat about a^b or something? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 7 and 82. 7^something? 7^something is way larger than 89. Maybe 82^something? 82^something is way too big.\n\nWhat about a concatenated numbers? 7 and 82: 782? No, output is 89. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's a function like a multiplied by something plus b or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the first pair: 7 and 82, output 89.\n\nLet me see: 7*12 +5=89? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 7 + (8-2)=7+6=13 no. Maybe 7* something plus 82? 7* something is 89-82=7, so 7*1 +82=89. So 7*1 +82=89. But what is 1? Maybe (something from the other number? Maybe 82 -81? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait let's look at the second pair: 31 and96 gives 127. 31* something + something.\n\n31*4=124, 124 +3=127. Hmm, not obvious.\n\nWait let's go back. Since the first four outputs match a + b, let's check the fifth input:\n\n10 +46=56, which is the output. So 10 +46=56. 10+46=56. Correct.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is simply a + b.\n\nLet me verify all:\n\n1. 7 +82=89: Correct.\n2. 31 +96=127: Correct.\n3. 15 +23=38: Correct.\n4. 40 +41=81: Correct.\n5. 10 +46=56: Correct.\n\nYes, seems consistent. So the instruction is probably \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another pattern.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe it's a function like a^2 + b or something.\n\n1. 7^2 +82=49+82=131≠89. Nope.\n\nOr b^2 +a: 82^2 +7=6724 +7=6731≠89. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, b -a: 82-7=75≠89. No.\n\nWait, let's think of it as a concatenated numbers: 7 concatenated with 82 is 782, but output is 89. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, 7 + 8*2=7+16=23≠89. Not.\n\nWait 7*12 + something? 7*12=84, 84 +5=89. Maybe 5 is b- something? 82-77? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 7* something plus 82/ something.\n\nWait maybe it's (a + b) - something.\n\n7 +82=89, which is the output. So maybe it's simply a + b.\n\nSimilarly, 31 +96=127, which is the output. 15 +23=38, yes. 40 +41=81, yes. 10 +46=56, yes.\n\nSo it's consistent that the output is the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is probably \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is c = a + b.\n\nLet me just confirm each:\n\n1. 7 +82=89: Correct.\n2. 31 +96=127: Correct.\n3. 15 +23=38: Correct.\n4. 40 +41=81: Correct.\n5. 10 +46=56: Correct.\n\nYes, all match.

Input: 61 77, Output: 138\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. 80 80 → 160\n2. 84 90 → 174\n3. 25 37 → 62\n4. 28 96 → 124\n5. 61 77 → 138\n\nFirst, let's look for a pattern or formula that connects the inputs to the output.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or some combination.\n\nStarting with the first pair: 80 and 80 give 160. 80 + 80 = 160. That seems straightforward. Maybe it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the next input:\n\nSecond input: 84 and 90. If we add them: 84 + 90 = 174. Which matches the output of 174. Interesting, so maybe it's always the sum of the two numbers.\n\nLet's check the third input: 25 and 37. Sum is 25 + 37 = 62. Which matches the output of 62.\n\nFourth input: 28 and 96. Sum is 28 + 96 = 124. Which matches the output of 124.\n\nFifth input: 61 and 77. Sum is 61 + 77 = 138. Which matches the output of 138.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given as input to get the output.\n\nLet me verify each case:\n\n1. 80 + 80 = 160 ✔️\n2. 84 + 90 = 174 ✔️\n3. 25 + 37 = 62 ✔️\n4. 28 + 96 = 124 ✔️\n5. 61 + 77 = 138 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's multiplying or something else.\n\nCheck first case: 80*2 = 160, yes, it's doubling the first number or something? Wait, 80*2 is 160, but the second number is also 80. Maybe it's doubling the sum? 80 + 80 = 160, which is double 80. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 84 + 90 = 174. Is 174 related to 84 and 90? 84*2 + 90 = 168 +90=258, no. 84 + 90 = 174, so it's just the sum again.\n\nThird input: 25 + 37 = 62. 25 + 37 is 62, so same as sum.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nWait, let me check another possibility: Maybe it's multiplying the two numbers and then subtracting something or doing something else.\n\nFirst input: 80*80 = 6400, which is not 160. So no.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 80*80 = 6400, 6400 minus something? Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum of the two numbers times something? Max(80,80)=80, 80*2=160. That works for first case.\n\nSecond input: max(84,90)=90. 90* something? 90* (something) =174. 174/90≈1.933, not integer.\n\nThird input: max(25,37)=37. 37* something=62. 62/37≈1.675, not integer.\n\nSo probably not max times something.\n\nAlternatively, sum of squares? 80² +80²= 12800, not 160.\n\nAlternatively, product divided by something: 80*80=6400, 6400 / something =160. 6400/160=40. Maybe divide by 40? 80/40=2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the two numbers multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's the sum of the two numbers multiplied by 1? Because 80+80=160, 84+90=174, etc. So it's just adding them.\n\nGiven all the test cases fit the sum, I think the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers together.\n\nLet me just verify all outputs:\n\n1. 80 +80=160 ✅\n2. 84 +90=174 ✅\n3.25 +37=62 ✅\n4.28 +96=124 ✅\n5.61 +77=138 ✅\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as \\boxed{a + b}\n\nWait, but the user probably expects the specific instruction instruction. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"What was the instruction?\" and the user provided five pairs with outputs based on some instruction.\n\nGiven all the outputs match the sum of the two inputs, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nExpressed as: \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply the sum. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{\\text{Add the two numbers}}.\n\nBut let me check if it's a formula or something else. Wait, let me see if it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let me check the third input: 25 and 37 sum to 62, which is less than 25*37=925. So no, it's definitely addition.\n\nSo yeah, it's addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nThus, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as: add the first input and the second input.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the inputs into outputs. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 12 48, Output: 60\n2. Input: 6 74, Output: 80\n3. Input: 64 99, Output: 163\n4. Input: 7 41, Output: 48\n5. Input: 20 47, Output: 67\n\nHmm, so each input is two numbers, and each gives an output. Let me denote the inputs as (a, b) and outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. (12, 48) → 60\n2. (6, 74) → 80\n3. (64, 99) → 163\n4. (7, 41) → 48\n5. (20, 47) → 67\n\nI need to find a relationship between a, b and c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, maybe something else like a function like a + b, a * b, or a^b or something else.\n\nLet's start with simple operations.\n\nFirst pair: 12 and 48 give 60.\n\n12 + 48 = 60. Oh! That's exactly the output. So maybe it's just a + b.\n\nLet me check the next pair: Input 6 and 74 → Output 80.\n\n6 + 74 = 80. That works too.\n\nThird pair: 64 + 99 = 163. Yep, that's the output given.\n\nFourth pair: 7 + 41 = 48. Wait, 7 + 41 is 48. Correct.\n\nFifth pair: 20 + 47 = 67. Yes, 20 + 47 is 67. Perfect.\n\nWait, so is it simply a + b? Let me verify all:\n\n1. 12 + 48 = 60 ✔️\n2. 6 + 74 = 80 ✔️\n3. 64 + 99 = 163 ✔️\n4. 7 + 41 = 48 ✔️\n5. 20 + 47 = 67 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's a different formula or some other operation.\n\nLet me check the second input: 6 and 74 gives 80. 6* something? 6* something is 80? 6* something is 80? 80/6 ≈13.33, not an integer. Maybe 6 + something else? 6 + 74 is 80, yes.\n\nWait, let me check if it's a*b - something.\n\n6*74 = 444, which is not 80. 6* something else? 6* something plus something? Maybe a + b* something? Let me see:\n\nWait, but the first case is 12 + 48 = 60, which is 12 + 48 = 60. Second case 6 +74=80, which is same as 6 +74. Third case 64 +99=163, which is same as 64 +99. So it's consistently a + b.\n\nLet me check the fourth input: 7 and 41. 7 + 41 = 48, which is the output. Correct.\n\nFifth input:20 +47=67, which is the output. So yes, it's simply the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure there isn't another pattern. Maybe it's a function like a multiplied by something or b multiplied or something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n12 and 48: 12*something + something? 12*5=60, but 48 is 4*12. Maybe 12*5=60, but 48 is 4*12. Maybe 5*12=60 and 4*12=48? Wait no, that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe it's a function like a multiplied by something plus b multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's consider c = a + b. Let's test:\n\n1. 12 + 48 = 60 ✔️\n2. 6 +74=80 ✔️\n3. 64 +99=163 ✔️\n4.7 +41=48 ✔️\n5.20 +47=67 ✔️\n\nAll match. So it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if it's something else. Maybe a multiplied by b divided by something?\n\n12*48=576, not 60. So no.\n\nAlternatively, b - something? 48 - 12*something? 48 - 12* something? 48 - 12* something = 60? No, 48 - something =60 would be negative. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, b - a? 48 -12=36≠60. No.\n\nAlternatively, a multiplied by something plus b. 12*5 + something? 12*5=60, so maybe 5*b? 5*48=240≠60. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a + b - something. 12 +48 - something=60. 60 - something=60, so something=0. Maybe subtract zero? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a multiplied by b divided by something. 12*48=576. 576 / something =60. 576/9.6=60, but that's not a nice number.\n\nAlternatively, 12* something + 48* something? 12*5 +48* something? 60 + something=60? Maybe 0. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, it's just a + b. It works for all cases.\n\nTherefore, I think the instruction is simply to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all:\n\n1. 12 +48=60 ✔️\n2.6 +74=80 ✔️\n3.64 +99=163 ✔️\n4.7 +41=48 ✔️\n5.20 +47=67 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction, it would be \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is: The instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the rule, probably stating it as \"add the two numbers.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the instruction was\" followed by the inputs and outputs. So probably the instruction is an operation like \"add the two numbers\" or something.\n\nBut let me read the original problem again:\n\n\"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\nHere are the input-output pairs:\n\nInput: 12 48\nOutput: 60\n\nInput: 6 74\nOutput: 80\n\nInput: 64 99\nOutput: 163\n\nInput: 7 41\nOutput: 48\n\nInput: 20 47\nOutput: 67\n\nThe instruction was\"\n\nSo it's likely that the instruction is an operation like \"add the two numbers.\" So probably the rule is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as: add the first and second numbers.\n\nSo in boxed form: \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut let me confirm with the given outputs.\n\nYes, 12 +48=60, 6+74=80, etc., all match.\n\nSo the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. Therefore, the rule is to add them. So the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Maybe it's a mathematical operation like addition, multiplication, something else.\n\nLet me consider different possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a simple sum: a + b.\n\nTest first input: 31 + 59 = 90. Hey, that's exactly the output. Let's check the next one.\n\n17 + 56 = 73. That matches the second output. Next:\n\n9 + 40 = 49. Yep, that's the third output. Then:\n\n46 + 84 = 130. Wait, 46 + 84 is 130? Let me calculate: 46 + 84 is 130? 46 + 84 is 130? 46 + 80 is 126, plus 4 is 130. Yes, correct.\n\nLast input: 2 + 11 = 13. Which matches the output of 13.\n\nWait, so all outputs are just the sum of the two numbers. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together.\n\nBut let me verify each case:\n\n1. 31 + 59 = 90 ✔️\n2. 17 + 56 = 73 ✔️\n3. 9 + 40 = 49 ✔️\n4. 46 + 84 = 130 ✔️\n5. 2 + 11 = 13 ✔️\n\nAll match perfectly. So the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: take the sum of the two inputs.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n31 * 59 is way more than 90, so no. Division? 31 + 59 is 90, but 31* something? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a formula like a^2 + b or something else? Let's test:\n\nFirst input: 31 and 59. 31 squared is 961, plus something? Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, 31* something minus something? Maybe 31* something? 31* something? 31*2.9? Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 31 + (59 - something). Maybe 31 + 59 = 90, which is the output. So perhaps it's always a + b.\n\nYes, since all the outputs match the sum of the two numbers, it's likely the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all:\n\n1. 31 + 59 = 90 ✔️\n2. 17 + 56 = 73 ✔️\n3. 9 + 40 = 49 ✔️\n4. 46 + 84 = 130 ✔️\n5. 2 + 11 = 13 ✔️\n\nYep, all correct.

I have four input pairs and their corresponding outputs. Let me list them out:\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n\n1. Input: 34 56 → Output: 90\n2. Input: 79 87 → Output: 166\n3. Input: 59 63 → Output: 122\n4. Input: 25 80 → Output: 105\n5. Input: 11 58 → Output: 69\n\nI need to find the instruction or rule that transforms each pair into the output. Let's look for a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's consider basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else.\n\nLet me list the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. 34 and 56 give 90\n2. 79 and 87 give 166\n3. 59 and 63 give 122\n4. 25 and 80 give 105\n5. 11 and 58 give 69\n\nLet me check if it's a sum: 34 + 56 = 90. Hey, that's exactly the output. Let's check the next one.\n\n79 + 87 = 166. Yep, that's the output given. Next:\n\n59 + 63 = 122. Yes, that's the output. Then:\n\n25 + 80 = 105. Correct, output is 105. Last one:\n\n11 + 58 = 69. Yes, output is 69.\n\nWait, so is it just adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\nFirst input: 34 + 56 = 90. Output is 90. Correct.\n\nSecond: 79 + 87 = 166. Output is 166. Correct.\n\nThird: 59 + 63 = 122. Correct.\n\nFourth: 25 + 80 = 105. Correct.\n\nFifth: 11 + 58 = 69. Correct.\n\nSo it seems the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n34 * 56 = 1904, which is not 90. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 56 - 34 = 22, not 90. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 34* something? 34*2=68, not 90. Maybe average? (34 + something)/2? 34 + 56 =90, average would be 45, not 90. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's concatenation? 34 concatenated with 56 is 3456, which is way more than 90. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 34 - 56? Negative number, but output is positive. Maybe absolute difference? |34 -56|=22 ≠90. Nope.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's multiplying the digits? 3*4 +5*6? 3*4=12, 5*6=30; 12+30=42≠90. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think about another approach. Maybe it's a function like a*b + something.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and see if it's a formula like a + b, a*b, or a^b or something else.\n\nFirst case: 34 +56=90, which is the output. 34* something? 34*2.647≈90? Maybe not.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n34 + 56 = 90\n\n79 +87=166\n\n59 +63=122\n\n25 +80=105\n\n11 +58=69\n\nIt seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers. Let me verify each:\n\n34 +56 =90: yes.\n\n79 +87=166: yes.\n\n59 +63=122: yes.\n\n25 +80=105: yes.\n\n11 +58=69: yes.\n\nSo the pattern is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if it's a different operation. Maybe it's concatenation? Let me see:\n\n34 concatenated with 56 is 3456, which is not 90. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract the smaller from the larger? 56 -34=22, not 90. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 34*56=1904, which is not 90.\n\nAlternatively, 34 + 5^6? 5^6 is 15625, way too big. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 34 + 5*6: 34 +30=64≠90. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, let's think of another formula. Maybe (a + b)*something.\n\nLet me take the first pair: 34 and 56. Output is 90.\n\nCompute 34 + 56 =90. So it's just adding them.\n\nSecond pair:79 +87=166, which is the output.\n\nThird:59 +63=122, yes.\n\nFourth:25 +80=105, yes.\n\nFifth:11 +58=69, yes.\n\nSo it's consistently the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: take the two numbers and add them together.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all the pairs:\n\n34 +56=90 ✔️\n\n79 +87=166 ✔️\n\n59 +63=122 ✔️\n\n25 +80=105 ✔️\n\n11 +58=69 ✔️\n\nYes, all match.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects an instruction phrase, maybe \"add the two numbers\" or \"sum the two inputs.\"\n\nBut let me check if it's a specific operation like product or something else, but since all outputs match the sum, I think it's safe to conclude it's addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply adding the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as: \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition.\n\n\\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the specific instruction, maybe it's written as \"add the two numbers.\" But since it's an instruction, perhaps stating it as \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nBut let me read the problem again: \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the input-output pairs...\" So the user is asking for the instruction, which is the rule.\n\nGiven all the outputs match the sum of the two numbers, the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

It says \"the instruction was\" and then gives the pairs. So likely it's an arithmetic operation like sum, product, difference, etc.\n\nGiven all the results match the sum, it's addition.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nThus, the rule is addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as: add the first number and the second number.\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition, which can be represented as the sum. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b} where a and b are the inputs.\n\nBut since the user probably expects the specific operation described, it's addition.\n\n**Final Answer</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 24 and 43 concatenated is 2443, but that's way bigger than 67.

Nice.\n\nThird input: 60 and 73. 60 +73 = 133. That's the output given. Good.\n\nFourth input: 52 and 68. 52 +68 = 120. Which is the output. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 9 and 83. 9 +83 =92. That's exactly the output given as well.\n\nWait, so it seems like the rule is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 13 +77 =90 ✔️\n2. 69 +76=145 ✔️\n3. 60 +73=133 ✔️\n4. 52 +68=120 ✔️\n5. 9 +83=92 ✔️\n\nAll of them add up correctly. So maybe the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n1. 13*77 = 1001, which is not 90. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 77 -13=64 ≠90. Not that either.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 13* something? 13* something plus something else? Maybe it's a combination.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n90, 145, 133, 120, 92.\n\nIs there another pattern? Maybe it's a function like a*input1 + b*input2?\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nLet me denote the output as a*13 + b*77 =90\n\nSimilarly for the next ones:\n\n69a +76b =145\n\n60a +73b=133\n\n52a +68b=120\n\n9a +83b=92\n\nWe can set up a system of equations to find a and b.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, since all the sums worked when we just added them, maybe it's indeed addition.\n\nLet me test it with the first pair:\n\n13 +77=90, yes.\n\nSecond:69+76=145, yes.\n\nThird:60+73=133, yes.\n\nFourth:52+68=120, yes.\n\nFifth:9+83=92, yes.\n\nSo it seems consistent. Therefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nSo the rule is: output = first number + second number.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Input: 77 79, Output: 156\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's look for a pattern here.\n\nFirst, let's list them:\n\n1. 80 and 94 give 174\n2. 45 and 92 give 137\n3. 7 and 47 give 54\n4. 1 and 53 give 54\n5. 77 and 79 give 156\n\nHmm. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation? Let's check.\n\nLet me consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nLet's take the first pair: 80 and 94 result in 174.\n\nIf I add them: 80 + 94 = 174.

So maybe the instruction was to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\n1. 12*18=216 ≠30. So nope.\n\nSubtraction: 18-12=6 ≠30. Nope.\n\nMultiplication inverse? 12* something? 12*2.5=30? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 12*2.5=30, but 18* something? Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product minus something? 12*18=216 - 186=30? Wait 216 - 186=30? Wait 12*18 is 216, 216 - 186=30? Wait 18* something? Maybe not.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nWait 12*2.5=30, 18* something? 18* something is 18* (something). 18* (something) = 30? 30/18≈1.666, not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference squared? 18-12=6, 6^2=36≠30. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, product minus sum: 12*18 - (12+18)=216 -30=186≠30. Nope.\n\nWait let's think differently. Maybe it's the product divided by something. 12*18=216. 216 divided by something is 30. 216/7.2=30? Not a nice number.\n\nAlternatively, 18 - (12/ something). 18 - (12/ something)=30?

Maybe it's something else like product minus something or product minus one number or something else.\n\nWait let's try multiplication minus something:\n\n12*18=216. 216 minus something is 30? 216 - 186=30. 186 is 12* something? 12*15.5=186.

No, 1*131=131, but 66-65=1, so 1*131=131.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Input: 23 23, Output: 46\n2. Input: 65 82, Output: 147\n3. Input: 79 94, Output: 173\n4. Input: 31 90, Output: 121\n5. Input: 37 49, Output: 86\n\nFirst, let's look for a pattern or mathematical operation that connects the inputs to the output.\n\nLet me consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else.\n\nStarting with the first pair: Input 23 and 23, output 46. 23 + 23 is 46. Hmm, that works for the first one. Let's check if this holds for the next ones.\n\nSecond input: 65 and 82. If we add them: 65 + 82 = 147. Hey, that's exactly the output given (147). Interesting.\n\nThird input: 79 and 94. 79 + 94 = 173. Which matches the output of 173. So far, it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet's check the fourth input: 31 and 90. 31 + 90 = 121. That's exactly the output given (121). Nice, that works too.\n\nFifth input: 37 and 49. 37 + 49 = 86. Which matches the output of 86. Wow, so all the outputs are just the sum of the two numbers in each input pair.\n\nWait, let me verify each one:\n\n1. 23 + 23 = 46 ✔️\n2. 65 + 82 = 147 ✔️\n3. 79 + 94 = 173 ✔️\n4. 31 + 90 = 121 ✔️\n5. 37 + 49 = 86 ✔️\n\nAll of them add the two numbers and get the output. So the instruction must be to add the two input numbers.\n\nIs there any possibility it's something else? Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 23*23 = 529, which isn't 46. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 23 - 23 = 0, not 46. Plus doesn't seem to fit.\n\nMaybe product of the two numbers? 23*23=529, not 46. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe something else like concatenation? 23 concatenated with 23 is 2323, which isn't 46. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the squares? 23² + 23² = 529 + 529 = 1058, not 46. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, difference? 23 - 23 = 0, not 46. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo addition seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers together.\n\nLet me just confirm each:\n\n1. 23 + 23 = 46 ✅\n2. 65 + 82 = 147 ✅\n3. 79 + 94 = 173 ✅\n4. 31 + 90 = 121 ✅\n5. 37 + 49 = 86 ✅\n\nYep, all correct.

Input: 45 97 → Output: 142\n3. Input: 0 45 → Output: 45\n4. Input: 67 82 → Output: 149\n5. Input: 48 54 → Output: 102\n\nHmm, let's look for a pattern here. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation or something else.\n\nFirst pair: 46 and 83 give 129. Let's see:\n\n46 + 83 = 129. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 45 and 97. If I add them: 45 + 97 = 142. Which matches the output given (142). Interesting.\n\nThird input: 0 and 45. 0 + 45 = 45. Output is 45. So that works too.\n\nFourth input: 67 and 82. Let's add them: 67 + 82 = 149. Which is the output given. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 48 and 54. 48 + 54 = 102. Which matches the output. Wow, so all outputs are just the sum of the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\n1. 46 + 83 = 129 ✔️\n2. 45 + 97 = 142 ✔️\n3. 0 + 45 = 45 ✔️\n4. 67 + 82 = 149 ✔️\n5. 48 + 54 = 102 ✔️\n\nSo it seems the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation.\n\nWait, let me check if it's multiplication or something else. 46* something? 46* something? 46*2.978≈129? Probably not. It seems addition works for all.\n\nLet me check the third input again: 0 and 45. 0 + 45 is 45, which is the output. Makes sense.\n\nSo the instruction is probably to add the two numbers. Let me just confirm with all given pairs.\n\nYes, seems consistent. So the rule is: take the two numbers and add them together.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me read the original problem statement again. It says \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.\" So it's likely that the instruction is an addition rule.\n\nTherefore, the instruction must be \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything else. Maybe it's concatenation or something else? Let's see:\n\nWait, 46 and 83: concatenating 46 and 83 would be 4683, which is not 129. So no.\n\nOr maybe 46 multiplied by something? 46*2.8 is 129? Not a whole number. Maybe 46 + 83 = 129, yes.\n\nAlternatively, 46*3 = 138, which is not 129. Maybe 46 + 80 = 126, not 129. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo addition seems the only consistent one.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all:\n\n1. 46 + 83 = 129 ✅\n2. 45 + 97 = 142 ✅\n3. 0 + 45 = 45 ✅\n4. 67 + 82 = 149 ✅\n5. 48 + 54 = 102 ✅\n\nYep, all correct.

So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nExpressed as an instruction: \"Add the two numbers.\"\n\nBut let me check if it's a specific formula or something else. Wait, let me see if it's something else like product or something else.\n\nWait, let's check the third input: 0 and 45 gives 45. If it was product, 0*45=0≠45? No, not that. If it was max(a,b): max(0,45)=45. That works for the third input. Let's check others:\n\nFirst input: max(46,83)=83≠129. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe min(a,b) + something? min(46,83)=46, 46 + something=129? 129-46=83. So maybe min + max? 46+83=129. That works for first input.\n\nSecond input: min(45,97)=45, 45 + something=142. 142-45=97. So min + max(45,97)=142. That works.\n\nThird input: min(0,45)=0, 0 + max(0,45)=45. 0 +45=45. Output is 45. So that works.\n\nFourth input: min(67,82)=67, 67 + max(67,82)=82. 67+82=149. Output is 149. Correct.\n\nFifth input: min(48,54)=48, 48 + max(48,54)=54. 48+54=102. Correct.\n\nSo the instruction is: take the minimum of the two numbers and add it to the maximum of the two numbers. Which is essentially adding them together because min(a,b) + max(a,b) = a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers by taking the minimum and maximum and summing them.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the smaller of the two numbers and the larger one.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased is \"I gave a friend an instruction...\" So maybe it's written as \"add the two numbers.\" Let me read the original problem again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the input-output pairs...\" So it's likely the instruction is an addition rule.\n\nBut from the analysis, it's the minimum and maximum addition.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nIf the output is min(a,b) + max(a,b), which is always equal to a + b.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers together.\"\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nFirst input: 46 +83=129 ✔️\n\nSecond:45 +97=142 ✔️\n\nThird:0 +45=45 ✔️\n\nFourth:67 +82=149 ✔️\n\nFifth:48 +54=102 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

I have four pairs:\n\n1. Input: 1 64, Output: 65\n2. Input: 40 50, Output: 90\n3. Input: 69 81, Output: 150\n4. Input: 34 53, Output: 87\n5. Input: 69 79, Output: 148\n\nI need to find the instruction or rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. (1, 64) → 65\n2. (40, 50) → 90\n3. (69, 81) → 150\n4. (34, 53) → 87\n5. (69, 79) → 148\n\nHmm. Let's consider possible operations. Maybe it's addition, subtraction, multiplication, or some function.\n\nFirst pair: Input 1 and 64 gives 65. Let's see: 1 + 64 = 65. That works. Maybe it's just adding the two numbers? Let's check the next pair.\n\nSecond pair: Input 40 and 50. If we add them: 40 + 50 = 90, which matches the output 90. Interesting.\n\nThird pair: 69 + 81 = 150. Output is 150. So that works too.\n\nFourth pair: 34 + 53 = 87. Output is 87. Perfect.\n\nFifth pair: 69 + 79 = 148. Output is 148. Also matches.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all outputs match the sum of the two inputs.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. 1 + 64 = 65 ✔️\n2. 40 + 50 = 90 ✔️\n3. 69 + 81 = 150 ✔️\n4. 34 + 53 = 87 ✔️\n5. 69 + 79 = 148 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't another possible rule. Maybe it's something else like product or something else.\n\nCheck the first one: 1*64=64, but output is 65, which is 64 +1. Hmm, not quite.\n\nSecond: 40*50=2000? No, output is 90. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe subtraction? 64 -1=63 ≠65. Close but not exact.\n\nMaybe absolute difference? |1 -64|=63 ≠65. Close but not.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 1*64 +1=65. Maybe (a*b) + something? Let's see:\n\n1*64 +1 =65\n\n40*50 + something? 40*50=2000, which is not 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a function like a + b - something.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst input: 1 and 64, output 65. 64 +1 =65.\n\nSecond input: 40 and 50, sum is 90, output is 90.\n\nThird: 69 +81=150, output is 150.\n\nFourth: 34 +53=87, output is 87.\n\nFifth: 69 +79=148, output is 148.\n\nSo it seems consistent that the output is simply the sum of the two numbers. Let me check each:\n\n1 + 64 = 65 ✓\n\n40 +50=90 ✓\n\n69 +81=150 ✓\n\n34 +53=87 ✓\n\n69 +79=148 ✓\n\nYes, all match. So the instruction is probably to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if it's a different operation. Maybe it's concatenation? Like 1 and 64 concatenated is 164, but 164 isn't 65. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of squares? 1² +64²=1+4096=4097≠65. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, product? 1*64=64, output is 65, which is 64 +1. Maybe add 1? But then 40*50=2000, output is 90, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, difference? 64 -1 + something? 63 + something? Doesn't seem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe max(a, b) + min(a,b). Let's check:\n\nFirst input: max(1,64)=64, min=1, sum 65. Output is 65. That works.\n\nSecond input: max(40,50)=50, min=40, sum 90. Output is 90. Works.\n\nThird input: max(69,81)=81, min=69, sum 150. Output is 150. Works.\n\nFourth input: max(34,53)=53, min=34, sum 87. Output is 87. Works.\n\nFifth input: max(69,79)=79, min=69, sum 148. Output is 148. Perfect.\n\nSo another possible rule is the sum of the two numbers, which is max(a,b) + min(a,b) = a + b. So it's just the sum.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers given as input.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output = input1 + input2.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just verify all:\n\n1 +64=65\n\n40+50=90\n\n69+81=150\n\n34+53=87\n\n69+79=148\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

There are four pairs provided:\n\n1. Input: 11 11 → Output: 22\n2. Input: 67 69 → Output: 136\n3. Input: 12 17 → Output: 29\n4. Input: 50 89 → Output: 139\n5. Input: 23 77 → Output: 100\n\nI need to find the rule or instruction that transforms the two numbers into the output.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. 11 and 11 give 22\n2. 67 and 69 give 136\n3. 12 and 17 give 29\n4. 50 and 89 give 139\n5. 23 and 77 give 100\n\nHmm. Let's consider possible operations. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, or some combination.\n\nFirst pair: 11 and 11 → 22. 11 + 11 = 22. That works. Maybe it's addition.\n\nSecond pair: 67 and 69. If we add them: 67 + 69 = 136. Hey, that's exactly the output given. Interesting.\n\nThird pair: 12 and 17. Let's add them: 12 + 17 = 29. Which matches the output.\n\nFourth pair: 50 and 89. 50 + 89 = 139. Yep, that's the output.\n\nFifth pair: 23 and 77. 23 + 77 = 100. Perfect, that's the output.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 11 + 11 = 22 ✔️\n2. 67 + 69 = 136 ✔️\n3. 12 + 17 = 29 ✔️\n4. 50 + 89 = 139 ✔️\n5. 23 + 77 = 100 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else. Maybe multiplication? Let's see:\n\n1. 11*11=121 ≠22. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 11-11=0≠22. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 11* something? 11*2=22. Maybe multiply the first by something and add?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first pair: 11 and 11 → 22. Maybe 11*2=22.\n\nSecond pair: 67 and 69. Output is 136. Let's see 67*2=134, which is close but not 136. 69*2=138. Not matching.\n\nThird pair: 12 and 17. 12*something + something? 12*2 + something? 24 +5=29? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 11 concatenated with 11 is 1111, which isn't 22. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of squares? 11² + 11² = 121 + 121=242≠22. Nope.\n\nWait, let's think about the outputs:\n\n22 is double of 11, 136 is roughly 67 + 69, 29 is 12 +17, 139 is 50 +89, 100 is 23 +77.\n\nSo all outputs are equal to the sum of the two numbers. So it's definitely addition.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n11 + 11 =22\n\n67 +69=136\n\n12 +17=29\n\n50 +89=139\n\n23 +77=100\n\nYes, all correct. So the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else. Maybe it's concatenation? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 11 11 → output 22. Concatenation would be 1111, which is not 22. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply the first by something and add the second? Let's see:\n\n11 * something + 11 = 22. 11*2=22, so 11*2 + 0? Maybe 11*2.\n\nSecond input: 67 and 69. 67* something +69=136. Let's see 67*2=134, 134 + something? 134 +2=136. Maybe 2*something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 67 + 69 =136, which is the output. So it's just addition.\n\nSame for all others:\n\n12 +17=29\n\n50 +89=139\n\n23 +77=100\n\nWhich all match the outputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers together.\n\nLet me just confirm each:\n\n1. 11 +11=22 ✔️\n\n2. 67 +69=136 ✔️\n\n3. 12 +17=29 ✔️\n\n4. 50 +89=139 ✔️\n\n5. 23 +77=100 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Let's check.\n\nFirst pair: 45 and 76 give 121.\n\nWhat's 45 + 76? 121. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 36 and 66. 36 + 66 = 102, which matches the output 102. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 9 and 85. 9 + 85 = 94.

So maybe the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's concatenation or something else?

Maybe it's the difference? 76 - 45 = 31, not 121.

Maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second.\n\nLet me denote the first number as a and second as b, and output as f(a,b).\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor input a1=45, b1=76, output=121: 45x +76y =121\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since it's only one instruction, perhaps it's simply a + b.\n\nWhich worked for all.

That works for the first one. Let me check the next ones.\n\nSecond input: 6 and 6. 6 + 6 = 12, which matches the output 12. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nThird input: 36 and 45. 36 + 45 = 81. Yes, that's the output given. So maybe it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nFourth input: 85 and 85. 85 + 85 = 170, which is the output. Perfect, that works.\n\nFifth input: 46 and 69. Let's add them: 46 + 69 = 115. Which matches the output given. So it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me verify all outputs:\n\n1. 36 + 58 = 94 ✔️\n2. 6 + 6 = 12 ✔️\n3. 36 + 45 = 81 ✔️\n4. 85 + 85 = 170 ✔️\n5. 46 + 69 = 115 ✔️\n\nAll match. So the instruction is to add the two numbers given as input.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 36*58 = 2088, which is not 94. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 58 - 36 = 22 ≠94. Not likely.\n\nMultiplying the two numbers and then something? 36* something? 36* something? 36*2.611≈94? Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 36 and 58 make 3658? But 3658 is way bigger than 94. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 36* something or 58 - something? 58 - 36* something? 58 - 36=22, not 94.\n\nAlternatively, 36 + 58/ something? 58/ something? 58/ something is not an integer here.\n\nWait, but the first operation worked when it was addition. Let me check all the other operations:\n\nSecond input: 6 and 6. If it was multiplication: 6*6=36≠12. Not.\n\nIf it was 6 + something else? 6*2=12. Maybe 6*2=12, but why 2? Maybe 6 + something else.\n\nWait, but the first case was 36 +58=94, second 6+6=12, which is 6*2, third 36+45=81, which is 9*9 or 36 + something else? Wait 36 + 45 is 81, which is 9 squared? Maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe it's the product of the two numbers divided by something.\n\nFirst input: 36*58=2088; 2088 divided by something is 94. 2088 / 2088/94= let's see 2088 /94=22.26... Not an integer. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, 58 - 36=22, not 94.\n\nWait, maybe it's the difference squared? 58 -36=22, 22 squared is 484≠94.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something? 36*58=2088; 2088 - something=94? 2088 - 1994=94? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, 36 + 5*8=36+40=76≠94. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, let me think about the outputs:\n\n94, 12, 81, 170, 115.\n\nLooking at these numbers: 94, 12, 81, 170, 115.\n\nIs there a pattern? Let's see:\n\n94: Maybe 36*2 + 22? Not obvious.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n94: Maybe 36*2 + 22? Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's look at the outputs:\n\n12 is 6*2, 81 is 9*9, 170 is 10*17, 115 is 5*23.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nWait, let me think about the first instruction being addition. It worked for all. Maybe it's always adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFirst input: 36 +58=94 ✔️\n\nSecond:6+6=12 ✔️\n\nThird:36+45=81 ✔️\n\nFourth:85+85=170 ✔️\n\nFifth:46+69=115 ✔️\n\nYes, all match. So perhaps the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me just verify each input:\n\n1. 36 +58 =94: Correct.\n\n2. 6 +6=12: Correct.\n\n3. 36 +45=81: Correct.\n\n4. 85 +85=170: Correct.\n\n5. 46 +69=115: Correct.\n\nYes, all outputs match the sum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers given.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output = first input + second input.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible operation, but since all the outputs match the sum, I think that's the rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is to sum the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects something like \"add the two numbers\" or a specific operation.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the pairs...\" So the instruction is presumably an operation, probably a formula.\n\nSo probably the rule is addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nThus, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut since the user probably expects the specific operation, maybe written as \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the instruction was\" and then gave the pairs. So likely it's an operation like sum, product, difference, etc.\n\nGiven all the results match addition, I think it's addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is \\boxed{a + b}\n\nBut let me see if it's written as \"add the first and second number\" or something.\n\nWait, the user probably expects the exact instruction. Since it's given as \"I gave a friend an instruction...\" and the outputs are based on that instruction.\n\nGiven all the examples, it's addition.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two numbers.\"\n\nSo the final answer is: The instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nBut in boxed form, probably as \\boxed{a + b}, but let me check the exact wording.\n\nWait, the user says</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

Input: 50 70, Output: 120\n\nI need to find the instruction or rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them again:\n\n1. 69 and 95 give 164\n2. 30 and 36 give 66\n3. 4 and 43 give 47\n4. 6 and 70 give 76\n5. 50 and 70 give 120\n\nHmm, let's consider possible operations.

Let's check:\n\n69 +95 = 164. Hey, that's the first output! 69 +95 is indeed 164. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 30 +36 =66. Output is 66. So 30+36=66. That works too.\n\nThird input: 4 +43=47. Output is 47. So 4+43=47. That works.\n\nFourth input:6 +70=76. 6+70=76. Yes, output is 76. So far, so good.\n\nFifth input:50 +70=120. 50+70=120. Output is 120. Perfect.\n\nWait, so is the instruction simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify all outputs match the sum of the two inputs.\n\nLet me list all:\n\n1. 69 +95 = 164 → Output is 164. Correct.\n2. 30 +36 =66 → Output is66. Correct.\n3. 4 +43=47 → Output is47. Correct.\n4. 6 +70=76 → Output is76. Correct.\n5. 50 +70=120 → Output is120. Correct.\n\nSo it seems the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else. Maybe multiplication? Let's see:\n\nFirst input: 69*95=6555, which is not 164. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 95-69=26≠164. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 69* something? 69*2.36≈164? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a linear combination: a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me denote output = k*a + m*b.\n\nLet me set up equations for the first case:\n\nFor input a=69, b=95, output=164:\n\n69k +95m =164\n\nSecond input: a=30, b=36, output=66:\n\n30k +36m=66\n\nThird input: a=4, b=43, output=47:\n\n4k +43m=47\n\nFourth input: a=6, b=70, output=76:\n\n6k +70m=76\n\nFifth input: a=50, b=70, output=120:\n\n50k +70m=120\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 69k +95m =164\n\n2. 30k +36m =66\n\n3. 4k +43m =47\n\n4. 6k +70m =76\n\n5. 50k +70m =120\n\nLet me try solving the first two equations to find k and m.\n\nEquation 2: 30k +36m =66\n\nWe can simplify it by dividing both sides by 6:\n\n5k +6m =11. Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nEquation 1: 69k +95m =164\n\nLet me solve equation 2a for k:\n\n5k = 11 -6m\n\nk = (11 -6m)/5\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n69*( (11 -6m)/5 ) +95m =164\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n69*(11 -6m) + 475m = 820\n\nCompute 69*11 = 759, 69*(-6m)= -414m\n\nSo 759 -414m +475m =820\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n759 + (475m -414m)=759 +61m=820\n\n61m=820 -759=61\n\nThus m=1\n\nThen from equation 2a: 5k +6*1=11 →5k=5→k=1\n\nSo k=1, m=1\n\nLet me check if this works for the third equation:\n\n4k +43m =4*1 +43*1=47. Yes, 4+43=47. Correct.\n\nFourth equation:6k +70m=6*1 +70*1=76. Correct, since 6+70=76.\n\nFifth equation:50k +70m=50*1 +70*1=120. Correct, 50+70=120.\n\nSo yes! The rule is simply a + b.

I have four input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let me list them again:\n\nInputs and Outputs:\n\n1. Input: 32 77 → Output: 109\n2. Input: 20 28 → Output: 48\n3. Input: 43 64 → Output: 107\n4. Input: 21 67 → Output: 88\n5. Input: 30 31 → Output: 61\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst pair: 32 and 77 give 109.\n\nLet me try 32 + 77 = 109. Oh, that's exactly the output. Wait, 32 +77 is 109. Let me check the next pair.\n\nSecond input: 20 and 28. 20 +28 = 48. Which matches the output 48. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 43 and 64. 43 +64 = 107. Yep, that's the output given.\n\nFourth input: 21 and 67. 21 +67 = 88. Which matches the output 88.\n\nFifth input: 30 and 31. 30 +31 = 61. Which is the given output.\n\nWait, so it seems like the output is simply the sum of the two numbers. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 32 +77 = 109 ✔️\n2. 20 +28 = 48 ✔️\n3. 43 +64 = 107 ✔️\n4. 21 +67 = 88 ✔️\n5. 30 +31 = 61 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 32*77 = 2464, which is not 109. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 77 -32 =45 ≠109. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 32* something? 32*3.4 is 109? Doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 32 concatenated with 77 is 3277, which isn't 109. Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 32* something plus 77? Let's see:\n\n32* something +77 =109. 32x +77=109 → 32x=32 → x=1. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 32^something? 32^something? 32^something + something else? Maybe not.\n\nBut since all the outputs match the sum, it's more likely the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the other pairs again:\n\nSecond input: 20 +28 =48, which is the output. Third: 43 +64=107, yes. Fourth:21 +67=88, yes. Fifth:30 +31=61, yes.\n\nSo it's consistent. Therefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nWait, let me read the original problem again. It says \"I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the input-output pairs...\" So it's likely that the instruction is an addition rule.\n\nTherefore, the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just confirm with all the pairs:\n\n32 +77 = 109 ✔️\n\n20 +28 =48 ✔️\n\n43 +64=107 ✔️\n\n21 +67=88 ✔️\n\n30 +31=61 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply the sum of the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nExpressed as an operation, it's the sum.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is to add the first input to the second input. Therefore, the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nThe instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the final answer is that the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition. Therefore, the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nExpressed as an operation: For inputs a and b, the output is a + b.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nThus, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. So the rule is simply addition. Therefore, the output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nThe specific instruction is: add the first number and the second number.\n\nSo, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.

I have five input-output pairs, and I need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let me list them again:\n\nInput: 2 77 → Output: 79  \nInput: 32 57 → Output: 89  \nInput: 15 21 → Output: 36  \nInput: 1 41 → Output: 42  \nInput: 45 58 → Output: 103\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation? Let's check.\n\nFirst pair: Input 2 and 77 gives 79. Let's see: 2 + 77 = 79. Oh! That works. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 32 and 57. If I add them: 32 + 57 = 89. That's exactly the output given. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 15 and 21. 15 +21 = 36. Which matches the output of 36. Wow, seems like it's just adding the two numbers.\n\nLet me check the next ones.\n\nFourth input: 1 and 41. 1 + 41 = 42. Which is the output given. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 45 and 58. 45 +58 = 103. Which matches the output of 103. So it seems consistent.\n\nSo the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together.\n\nWait, let me verify each step:\n\n1. 2 + 77 = 79 ✔️\n2. 32 +57 =89 ✔️\n3. 15 +21=36 ✔️\n4. 1 +41=42 ✔️\n5. 45 +58=103 ✔️\n\nYes, all outputs match the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 2*77=154 ≠79. Nope.\n\nSubtraction? 77-2=75≠79. Not that either.\n\nMaybe something else like product minus something? 2*77=154, 154 minus something? 154 - something =79? 154-79=75. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe concatenation? 2 and 77 make 277? No, output is 79. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, 2 squared plus 77? 4 +77=81≠79. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's the sum of the digits?\n\nFirst input: 2 and 77. Sum of digits: 2 +7+7=16. Not 79. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, product of the digits? 2*7*7=98≠79. Nope.\n\nWait, let's go back. Since all the outputs match the sum, it's likely addition.\n\nLet me just confirm:\n\n2 +77=79, yes.\n\n32 +57=89, yes.\n\n15 +21=36, yes.\n\n1 +41=42, yes.\n\n45 +58=103, yes.\n\nSo it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 50*93 = 4650, which is not 143. So nope, addition is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, subtraction? 93 - 50 = 43, not 143. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 50*93 is 4650, which is way bigger than 143. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, concatenation? 50 and 93 concatenated is 5093, which isn't 143. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe something else like max(a, b) or min(a, b). Let's see:\n\nFirst input: max(50,93)=93, but output is 143.

Nope.\n\nAlternatively, product minus something: 50* something? 50* something minus something else? Maybe 50* something plus something else.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's a linear combination: a * x + b * y = output.\n\nLet me denote the output as a function f(a, b) = something.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and output is f(a,b).\n\nFrom the first input: 50 and 93 gives 143.\n\nSo 50x + 93y = 143\n\nSecond input: 11x +19y = 30\n\nThird: 45x +62y = 107\n\nFourth:28x +38y=66\n\nFifth:16x +19y=35\n\nWe can set up a system of equations to find x and y.\n\nLet me take the first two equations:\n\nEquation 1: 50x +93y =143\n\nEquation 2:11x +19y =30\n\nLet me solve these two first.\n\nLet me use substitution or elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 50: 550x +950y = 1500\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 11: 550x + 1023y = 1573\n\nSubtract equation 1*11 from equation 2*50:\n\n(550x +950y) - (550x +1023y) = 1500 - 1573\n\nWhich is -73y = -73\n\nThus y = 1.\n\nSubstitute y=1 into equation 2:\n\n11x +19(1)=30\n\n11x +19=30\n\n11x=11\n\nx=1\n\nSo x=1, y=1.\n\nLet me check if this works for the third equation:\n\n45x +62y = 45*1 +62*1= 45+62=107.

Maybe 2* something.\n\nAlternatively, 26 + 3* something? 26 + 3*5= 26+15=41≠61. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 26 + 3* something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's a linear combination: a*x + b*y = output.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nLet me denote the output as a*Input1 + b*Input2 = Output.\n\nFor first input: 26a +35b =61\n\nSecond:68a +86b=154\n\nThird:7a +17b=24\n\nFourth:57a +75b=132\n\nFifth:45a +79b=124\n\nWe can solve for a and b.\n\nLet me take the first two equations:\n\n26a +35b =61 ...(1)\n\n68a +86b=154 ...(2)\n\nLet me solve equation 1 and 2.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 68 and 26* something:\n\nWait, maybe use substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1: 26a =61 -35b\n\na = (61 -35b)/26\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\n68*( (61 -35b)/26 ) +86b =154\n\nMultiply both sides by 26:\n\n68*(61 -35b) +86b*26 =154*26\n\nCompute:\n\n68*61 = let's calculate:\n\n68*60=4080, 68*1=68, total 4148\n\n68*(-35b)= -2380b\n\n86b*26: 86*26=2236, so 2236b\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n4148 -2380b +2236b = 154*26\n\nSimplify:\n\n4148 -44b = 4004\n\nSo 4148 -4004 =44b\n\n144 =44b\n\nb=144/44= 36/11≈3.27... Not integer, which is messy.\n\nMaybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nGiven that all outputs match the sum, perhaps it's just addition.\n\nLet me check the third input:7 and17→24. 7+17=24.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction or the rule that transforms the two numbers into the output. Let's list them out:\n\n1. Input: 22 76 → Output: 98\n2. Input: 81 89 → Output: 170\n3. Input: 46 72 → Output: 118\n4. Input: 8 70 → Output: 78\n5. Input: 42 79 → Output: 121\n\nHmm, I need to find a relationship between the two numbers and the result. Let's denote the inputs as a and b, and the outputs as c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=22, b=76 → c=98\n2. a=81, b=89 → c=170\n3. a=46, b=72 → c=118\n4. a=8, b=70 → c=78\n5. a=42, b=79 → c=121\n\nI need to find an operation or formula that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations:\n\nFirst thought: Maybe it's a linear combination like c = a * something + b * something.\n\nLet me try adding a and b: 22 +76=98. Wait, that's exactly the first output. Let me check if this holds for other inputs.\n\nSecond input: 81 +76? Wait no, wait the second input is 81 and 89. 81 +89=170, which is the output. Wait, that's the second output. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 46 +72=118, which is the output. Third output is 118. So that seems to fit.\n\nFourth input: 8 +70=78, which is the output. Yes, 8+70=78.\n\nFifth input: 42 +79=121, which is the output. 42+79=121. Wow, that works too!\n\nWait, so is the rule simply adding the two numbers? Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 22 +76 = 98 ✔️\n2. 81 +89 = 170 ✔️\n3. 46 +72 = 118 ✔️\n4. 8 +70 =78 ✔️\n5. 42 +79=121 ✔️\n\nWow, all of them match when we add the two numbers. So the instruction must be to add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication or something else.\n\nCheck first case: 22* something? 22* something plus something else? Let's see:\n\nIf it was a*b, let's see:\n\n22*76=1672, which is not 98. So no.\n\nIf it was a^b or b^a? 22^76 is way too big, not 98.\n\nMaybe a multiplied by b minus something? 22*76=1672, 1672 minus something? 1672 - 1672 +98= not sure. Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a + b - something? 22+76=98, so maybe subtract zero? Or perhaps it's a + b.\n\nYes, seems like addition works for all cases.\n\nLet me check the other way: Maybe it's a multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor input 22 and 76, output is 98. 22*4 + 76* something? Wait 22*4=88, 88 + something=98, something=10. Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, 22* something plus 76* something else.\n\nWait, let's think of it as c = a + b. Let's test:\n\n22 +76=98, yes.\n\n81 +89=170, yes.\n\n46 +72=118, yes.\n\n8 +70=78, yes.\n\n42 +79=121, yes.\n\nSo all outputs are simply the sum of the two inputs.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nSo the rule is: output is the sum of the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just verify each case:\n\nFirst input: 22 +76 =98.

I have five input-output pairs and need to find the instruction based on them. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Input: 24 53, Output: 77\n2. Input: 0 66, Output: 66\n3. Input: 10 67, Output: 77\n4. Input: 72 78, Output: 150\n5. Input: 22 36, Output: 58\n\nHmm, let's look for a pattern or formula that connects the inputs to the outputs.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible operations. Maybe addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nLooking at the first pair: Input 24 and 53, output 77.\n\nLet me compute 24 + 53 = 77. Oh! That gives exactly the output. Let me check if this works for other inputs.\n\nSecond input: 0 and 66. If I add them: 0 + 66 = 66, which matches the output 66. Nice.\n\nThird input: 10 and 67. 10 + 67 = 77. Output is 77. That works too.\n\nFourth input: 72 and 78. 72 + 78 = 150. The output is indeed 150. Perfect.\n\nFifth input: 22 and 36. 22 + 36 = 58. The output is 58. Wow, that also matches!\n\nSo it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 24 + 53 = 77 ✔️\n2. 0 + 66 = 66 ✔️\n3. 10 + 67 = 77 ✔️\n4. 72 + 78 = 150 ✔️\n5. 22 + 36 = 58 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe multiplication? Let's check:\n\nFirst input: 24*53 = 1272, which is not 77. So nope.\n\nSubtraction? 53 -24=29 ≠77. Nope.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 24* something? 24*3 + something? Doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, absolute difference? |24 -53|=29 ≠77. Nope.\n\nMaybe concatenation? 24 concatenated with 53 is 2453, which is way bigger than 77. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, sum of squares? 24² +53² is 576 + 2809=3385≠77. Nope.\n\nAlternatively, product of the two numbers minus something? 24*53=1272; 1272 minus something? 1272 - 1200=72, not 77. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, but the first case worked with addition. Let me check the last one:\n\n22 +36=58, which is the output. So it's consistent with addition.\n\nTherefore, it's likely the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nLet me just make sure none of the other operations could fit. Maybe a function like a*b + something?\n\nLet's take the first input: 24 and 53, output 77.\n\nIf it's 24* something + something else.\n\n24*3 + 1 =77? 24*3=72 +5=77? Maybe 24*3 +5=77? But 5 is the second number? Wait, 24* something plus something.\n\nWait, 24* something plus 53? 24* something =77 -53=24. So something is 1. So 24*1 +53=77. But then the second number is 53, so maybe a=24, b=53, output is a*1 +b=24 +53=77. But that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a + b - something? 24 +53 - something=77. 24+53=77, so 77 - something=77 ⇒ something=0. Maybe subtract zero? That's trivial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe max(a, b) + min(a,b). Let's check:\n\nFirst input: max(24,53)=53 + min(24,53)=24=77. 53+24=77. Yes! That works for the first case.\n\nSecond input: max(0,66)=66 + min(0,66)=0=66. Output is 66. That works.\n\nThird input: max(10,67)=67 + min(10,67)=10=77. 67+10=77. Correct.\n\nFourth input: max(72,78)=78 + min(72,78)=72=150. 78+72=150. Correct.\n\nFifth input: max(22,36)=36 + min(22,36)=22=58. 36+22=58. Correct.\n\nWow, that seems to fit all cases. So the instruction is to take the maximum of the two numbers and add the minimum of the two numbers.\n\nSo 77 is max(24,53)+min(24,53)=53+24=77\n\nSimilarly for all others.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: take the maximum of the two numbers and add the minimum of the two numbers.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst input: max(24,53)=53, min(24,53)=24; 53+24=77. Correct.\n\nSecond input: max(0,66)=66, min(0,66)=0; 66+0=66. Correct.\n\nThird input: max(10,67)=67, min(10,67)=10; 67+10=77. Correct.\n\nFourth input: max(72,78)=78, min(72,78)=72; 78+72=150. Correct.\n\nFifth input: max(22,36)=36, min(22,36)=22; 36+22=58. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the instruction is to find the maximum of the two numbers and add the minimum of the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output = max(a, b) + min(a, b), which is just a + b. Wait, but max(a,b) + min(a,b) is equal to a + b. So essentially, the output is the sum of the two numbers.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nmax(24,53)=53, min(24,53)=24; 53+24=77=24+53=77. So yes, it's the sum.\n\nSimilarly, for the second input: max(0,66)=66, min(0,66)=0; 66+0=66=0+66=66.\n\nSo it's just the sum of the two numbers. Therefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers together.\n\nSo the rule is simply addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just confirm with all:\n\n1. 24 +53=77 ✔️\n2. 0 +66=66 ✔️\n3. 10 +67=77 ✔️\n4.72 +78=150 ✔️\n5.22 +36=58 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is simply adding the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is to sum them. Therefore, the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: The instruction is to add the two numbers. So the rule is simply addition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the output is the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the rule is simply addition.\n\nThe specific instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers. Therefore, the rule is simply addition.\n\nExpressed as: The output is the sum of the two inputs.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two numbers.\n\nThus, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers. So the output is the sum of the two inputs. Therefore, the rule</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: The instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe"

Output is 68. Correct.\n\nSecond input: 4 + 42 = 46. Output is 46. Correct.\n\nThird: 36 + 43 = 79. Correct.\n\nFourth: 66 + 97 = 163. Correct.\n\nFifth: 7 + 45 = 52.

Maybe 4*b - something? Wait, 21* something plus b?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, 21 and 65 adding gives 86. 21* something? 21*4=84, plus 2 is 86. Maybe 4*b - something? 4*65=260, which is not 86. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe c = a + b - something.\n\n21 +65 = 86, which is equal to b? 65? No, 86 is not 65.

Maybe 21* something else.\n\nWait, 21*4=84, plus 2 is 86. Maybe 4*21 + 2? But 2 is b? Wait, b is 65 here? No, b is 65.\n\nWait, maybe it's a function like c = 2a + b? Let's check:\n\n2*21 +65=42 +65=107 ≠86. Nope.\n\nWhat about c = a + 2b? 21 + 130=151≠86. Nope.\n\nHow about c = a + b - something? 21 +65=86, so 86=21+65. So maybe it's just a + b.\n\nSimilarly, 55 +60=115, which is the output. 41 +46=87, yes. 61 +80=141, yes. 5 +47=52, which is 5+47=52.

Input: 32 43, Output: 75\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe it's a mathematical operation on the two numbers. Let's denote the two numbers as a and b, and the output as c.\n\nLooking for a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. a=19, b=27, c=46\n2. a=4, b=65, c=69\n3. a=20, b=34, c=54\n4. a=14, b=88, c=102\n5. a=32, b=43, c=75\n\nI need to find an operation that takes a and b and gives c.\n\nLet me consider possible operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or something else.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's a + b:\n\n1. 19 +27 =46. Hey, that's exactly the output. Let's check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 4 +65=69. That's the output given. Third input: 20 +34=54. Wait, 20+34 is 54, which matches the output. Fourth input:14 +88=102. Yes, that's the output given. Fifth input:32 +43=75. Which is the output. Wait, that seems consistent!\n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\n1. 19 +27 = 46. Output is 46.

Let me check all the outputs.\n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\nFirst input: 19 and 27 add up to 46. Output is 46. Correct.\n\nSecond input: 4 +65=69. Output is 69. Correct.\n\nThird:20 +34=54. Output is54. Correct.\n\nFourth:14 +88=102. Output is102. Correct.\n\nFifth:32 +43=75. Output is75. Correct.\n\nSo it seems the rule is simply adding the two numbers together.\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't another possible operation.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else like a multiplied by b or something else.\n\n19*27 is 513, which is not 46. So no.\n\na squared plus b? 19² +27= 361 +27=388≠46. Nope.\n\nWhat about b squared minus a? 27² -19=729 -19=710≠46. Nope.\n\nWhat about b -a? 27 -19=8, not 46. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the first pair: 19 and 27, sum is 46, which is the output. Similarly, 4 +65=69, which is the output. So it's just a + b.\n\nLet me test the other pairs:\n\n20 +34=54, which is the output. 14 +88=102, yes. 32 +43=75.

Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, 27 -19=8; 8* something? 8*5.75=46? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 46 is 19 +27, so it's addition.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to conclude the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is c = a + b.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

It says \"the instruction was\" followed by the user gave an instruction and five inputs. So perhaps it's a specific operation like \"sum the two numbers,\" or maybe \"multiply the first by something and add,\" etc.\n\nWait, let me check if it's something else.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n46, 69,54,102,75.\n\nIs there another pattern?\n\nLet me list them:\n\nInput pairs and outputs:\n\n1. 19 27 → 46\n\n2. 4 65 →69\n\n3.20 34→54\n\n4.14 88→102\n\n5.32 43→75\n\nLet me see if it's a linear combination: c = p*a + q*b\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor first input: 19p +27q =46\n\nSecond:4p +65q=69\n\nThird:20p +34q=54\n\nFourth:14p +88q=102\n\nFifth:32p +43q=75\n\nWe can try solving these equations to find p and q.\n\nBut this might take time, but let's try the first two equations.\n\nEquation1:19p +27q =46\n\nEquation2:4p +65q=69\n\nLet me solve for p and q.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 4: 76p +108q = 184\n\nMultiply equation2 by19: 76p +120q = 1251?

Input: 34 85, Output: 119\n4. Input: 39 69, Output: 108\n5. Input: 62 89, Output: 151\n\nHmm, let's look for a pattern. Maybe it's an arithmetic operation or something with addition or multiplication.\n\nLet me consider the first pair: Input 95 and 98, output 193. Let's see:\n\n95 + 98 = 193. Oh! That's exactly the output. Let me check the next one.\n\nSecond input: 9 and 78. If I add them: 9 + 78 = 87. Which matches the output given. Interesting.\n\nThird input: 34 and 85. 34 + 85 = 119. Yep, that's the output.\n\nFourth input: 39 and 69. 39 + 69 = 108. Which is the output given.\n\nFifth input: 62 and 89. 62 + 89 = 151. That's the output provided.\n\nWait, so it seems like the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together. Let me verify each case:\n\n1. 95 + 98 = 193 ✔️\n2. 9 + 78 = 87 ✔️\n3. 34 + 85 = 119 ✔️\n4. 39 + 69 = 108 ✔️\n5. 62 + 89 = 151 ✔️\n\nAll outputs match the sum of the two inputs. So the instruction must be to add the two numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another possible operation. Maybe it's concatenation or something else? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the first input: 95 and 98. If it was concatenation, 95 concatenated with 98 would be 9598, which isn't 193. So addition seems more likely.\n\nLet me check another possibility: subtraction or multiplication.\n\n95 - 98 = -3, not 193. 9*78= 702, not 87. So nope.\n\nWhat about 9^something? 9^something? 9^something? 9^something? Maybe reversing the digits? 95 reversed is 59, plus 98 reversed is 89, 59 +89=148, not 193. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference? 98 -95=3, not 193. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product? 95*2=190, close but not 193. 9* something? 9* something? 9* something else? 9* something else? Maybe 9* something plus something else.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second? Let's see:\n\nFor input 95 and 98, output is 193.\n\nLet me set up an equation: a * x + b * y = 193, where a and b are constants.\n\nBut since we have multiple inputs, maybe it's a linear combination.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as a and b, and output is c.\n\nSo:\n\n95 x + 98 y = 193\n\n9 x +78 y =87\n\n34x +85y=119\n\n39x +69y=108\n\n62x +89y=151\n\nWe can set up equations to find x and y.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, since all outputs are equal to the sum of the two numbers, let's test:\n\nFor first input: 95 +98=193, which is the output.\n\nSecond input:9 +78=87, which is the output.\n\nThird:34+85=119, yes.\n\nFourth:39+69=108, correct.\n\nFifth:62+89=151, correct.\n\nSo it's definitely addition.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is simply adding the two numbers together.\n\nSo the instruction is: add the two input numbers.\n\nLet me just confirm with all pairs:\n\n95 +98 = 193 ✔️\n\n9 +78 = 87 ✔️\n\n34 +85 = 119 ✔️\n\n39 +69 = 108 ✔️\n\n62 +89 = 151 ✔️\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.

Doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe product minus something? 71*2=142, not 150. 79*2=158, nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation? 71 and 79 concatenated is 7179, but that's way bigger than 150. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference? 79 -71=8, not 150. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's think about another approach.

Maybe 79 - something? 79 -11=68? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the difference between the two numbers multiplied by something.\n\n79 -71=8, 8* something=150? 8*18.75=150, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, 71*2 + 8=150? 71*2=142 +8=150. Maybe.\n\nSecond input:86 -69=17, 17* something + something=155. 17*9=153, +2=155. Maybe not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the difference and something.\n\n79 -71=8, 71* something? 71*2=142, not 150.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the first number multiplied by something plus the second.\n\n71*a +79*b=150. Let's see if we can find a and b.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to find a and b.\n\nBut since all the outputs match the sum, and it's consistent across all examples, I think it's safe to conclude that the instruction is simply adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: output is the sum of the two input numbers.\n\nSo the instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the instruction is \"add the two input numbers.\"\n\nLet me just confirm with all the examples:\n\n71 +79=150 ✔️\n\n69 +86=155 ✔️\n\n38 +40=78 ✔️\n\n10 +58=68 ✔️</think>\n\nThe instruction is to add the two numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe instruction is to add the two input numbers.
