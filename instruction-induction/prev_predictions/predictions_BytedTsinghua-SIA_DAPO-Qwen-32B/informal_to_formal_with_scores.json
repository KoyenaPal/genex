Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\n   Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - This involves rephrasing the sentence by changing \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\" and simplifying \"these two\" to \"them.\"\n\nBased on these examples, the instruction likely involves paraphrasing the sentences, making them either more formal, using different words or structures while preserving the meaning.\n\nNow, let's come up with the instruction that fits all these transformations.\n\nThe instruction could be: \"Rewrite each sentence in a different but equivalent form, using synonyms and possibly changing the sentence structure (active to passive or vice versa), while maintaining the original meaning.\"\n\nTo confirm, let's apply this instruction to the given input-output pairs and see if it fits:\n\n1. \"I considered many approaches.\" → \"Various approaches were considered.\"\n   - Changed \"considered many approaches\" to the passive voice and used \"various\" for \"many.\"\n\n2. \"The whole story was made up.\" → \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - Replaced \"whole\" with \"entire\" and \"made up\" with \"fabricated.\"\n\n3. \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\" → \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Changed the informal structure to a more formal one using \"whom.\"\n\n4. \"See you tonight.\" → \"I look forward to meeting you tonight.\"\n   - Expanded the casual phrase into a complete sentence expressing anticipation.\n\n5. \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\" → \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - Changed the expression \"can't tell the difference\" to \"find it hard to distinguish\" and simplified \"these two\" to \"them.\"\n\nThus, the instruction is likely:\n\n\"Paraphrase each sentence, maintaining its original meaning but using different words and possibly changing the sentence structure.\"\n\nSo the final instruction is:\n\n**Rewrite each sentence in a different but equivalent form, using synonyms and possibly changing the sentence structure (active to passive or vice versa), while maintaining the original meaning.**\n\nAssistant\nThe instruction is: \"Rewrite each sentence in a different but equivalent form, using synonyms and possibly changing the sentence structure (active to passive or vice versa), while maintaining the original meaning.\"<|endoftext|></think> \nThis instruction fits the given input-output pairs.<|endoftext|>",

Input: \"The lawyer I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   Output: \"The lawyer whom I met yesterday was helpful.\"\n   - Here, the change is from \"The lawyer I met\" to \"The lawyer whom I met,\" which makes the sentence more formal by using the relative pronoun \"whom.\"\n\n2. Input: \"Do you want me to go with you?\"\n   Output: \"Shall I accompany you?\"\n   - This involves rephrasing the question using a more formal verb \"accompany\" and changing the structure to \"Shall I...?\"\n\n3. Input: \"This song is fire.\"\n   Output: \"This song is incredibly good.\"\n   - This involves translating slang (\"fire\") into a more formal expression (\"incredibly good\").\n\n4. Input: \"The whole story was made up.\"\n   Output: \"The entire story was fabricated.\"\n   - Here, \"whole\" is replaced with \"entire,\" and \"made up\" is replaced with \"fabricated,\" both making the sentence more formal.\n\n5. Input: \"I can't tell the difference between these two.\"\n   Output: \"I find it hard to distinguish between them.\"\n   - This involves rephrasing the sentence using a different structure and more formal language (\"find it hard to distinguish\" instead of \"can't tell the difference\").\n\nBased on these examples, the instruction likely involves rewriting sentences in a more formal or polished manner.\n\nSo, the instruction could be: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal or polished way, using synonyms and more formal structures where appropriate.\"\n\nNow, let's test this instruction with a new input to see if we can generate an appropriate output.\n\nNew Input: \"She's really cool.\"\n\nUsing the instruction \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal or polished way, using synonyms and more formal structures where appropriate,\"\n\nOutput: \"She is quite impressive.\"\n\nThis output maintains the meaning of the input but uses a more formal expression (\"impressive\" instead of \"cool\"). \n\nThus, the instruction is likely: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal or polished way, using synonyms and more formal structures where appropriate.\"\n\nAssistant\nThe instruction is: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal or polished way, using synonyms and more formal structures where appropriate.\"<|endoftext|></think> \nTo confirm, let's apply this instruction to the given input-output pairs and see if they match:\n\n1.

The output uses the word \"fabricated\" as a synonym for \"made up\" and \"entire\" for \"whole,\" making the sentence slightly more formal.\n\nFrom these examples, the common theme appears to be transforming the sentences into more formal or polished versions while sometimes changing the structure (e.g., active to passive voice) and using synonyms for more sophisticated vocabulary.\n\nTherefore, the instruction likely involves rewriting sentences in a more formal or polished manner.\n\nThe instruction is: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal tone.\"\n\nAssistant\nThe instruction is: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal tone.\"<|endoftext|></think> \nThe instruction is: \"Rewrite the given sentences in a more formal tone.\"<|endoftext|>",
