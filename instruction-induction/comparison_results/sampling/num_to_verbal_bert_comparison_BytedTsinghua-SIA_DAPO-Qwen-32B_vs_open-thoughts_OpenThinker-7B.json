The remaining part is 860.\n\n3. Now, we convert 860:\n   - 8 is in the hundreds place. So, 800 is \"eight hundred.\"\n   - The remaining part is 60.\n   - 60 is \"sixty.\"\n\nSo putting it all together:\n- 5000 is \"five thousand.\"\n- 800 is \"eight hundred.\"\n- 60 is \"sixty.\"\n\nCombining these parts, we get: \"five thousand, eight hundred and sixty.\"\n\nTherefore, the written English representation of 5860 is:\n\nOutput: five thousand, eight hundred and sixty<|endoftext|> The instruction is: Convert a given number into its written English word format using the style demonstrated in the examples.\nThe new input is: 5860\nTo",
