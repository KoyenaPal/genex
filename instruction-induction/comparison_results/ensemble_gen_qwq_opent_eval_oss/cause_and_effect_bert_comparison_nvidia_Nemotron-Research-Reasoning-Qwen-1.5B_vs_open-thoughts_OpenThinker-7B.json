This means selecting the sentence that explains why the event in the other sentence occurred . For example, in the first pair, \"The power was out for days \" is the cause of the meat spoiling, so it's selected. Similarly, in the fifth pair, \"The man robbed a gas station\" is the reason he went to jail, making it the correct choice. The instruction can be phrased as: **\"For each pair of sentences, select the one that is the cause or reason for the event described in the other sentence.\"**  This aligns with all the given input-output pairs.
