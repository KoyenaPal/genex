    "model2_output": "<|begin_of_solution| >\n\nThe instruction given was to translate each input, which contains a question in various languages followed by a thank you, into English while keeping both parts in one sentence. The outputs show that the question (e.g., \"Where is the library ?\") and the expression of gratitude (e.g., \"Thank you\") were combined into a single English sentence. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Components :** Each input has a question about a library’s location and a thank you in the same language. 2. **Translate Separately :** Translate the question and the thank you separately into English. 3. **Combine into One Sentence :** Join them with a space or punctuation (like a question mark followed by a period). 4. **Maintain Politeness :** Ensure the thank you reflects the original’s politeness (e.g., \"Thank you for your help\" vs. \"Thank you\"). **Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to translate each input into English , merging the original question and thank you into a single sentence. For example, \"Где находится библиотека? Спасибо за информацию.\" becomes \"Where is the library? Thank you for the information.\"\n</think>\n\nThe instruction given was to **translate<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Translate each input into English, combining the question about the library's location and the accompanying expression of gratitude into a single sentence.**\n\n**Step-by",
