The outputs show that the question (e.g., \"Where is the library ?\") and the expression of gratitude (e.g., \"Thank you\") were combined into a single English sentence. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Components :** Each input has a question about a library’s location and a thank you in the same language. 2. **Translate Separately :** Translate the question and the thank you separately into English. 3. **Combine into One Sentence :** Join them with a space or punctuation (like a question mark followed by a period). 4. **Maintain Politeness :** Ensure the thank you reflects the original’s politeness (e.g., \"Thank you for your help\" vs. \"Thank you\"). **Final Answer:**  \nThe instruction was to translate each input into English , merging the original question and thank you into a single sentence. For example, \"Где находится библиотека? Спасибо за информацию.\" becomes \"Where is the library? Thank you for the information.\"\n</think>\n\nThe instruction given was to **translate<|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> The instruction is: **Translate each input into English, combining the question about the library's location and the accompanying expression of gratitude into a single sentence.**\n\n**Step-by",
