Inputs are 5 numbers. Output is single number. We see patterns: maybe count of letters? Or something mod? Let's try compute something: Maybe each is \"first number is prime?\" For first: 11 prime, 196=14^2, 5 prime, 64=8^2, 7 prime. Output 8. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe output is count of distinct prime factors? Let's compute: 11 prime factors: {11}. 196=2^2*7^2 => {2,7}. 5 {5}. 64 2. 7 7. Combine? Unique primes: 2,5,7,11: 4. Not 8.\n\nMaybe output is sum of digits? 11+196+5+64+7=283. Sum digits=13 -> not 8.\n\nMaybe count of numbers that are perfect squares? 196,64: 2 squares. Others not. Output 8 no.\n\nMaybe output is something like difference between max and min? Max 196 min 5 diff 191. not 8.\n\nMaybe output is something like count of numbers that are prime squares? 196=14^2 not prime; 64=8^2. 11 prime,5 prime,7 prime. Count primes 3. Output 8.\n\nMaybe output is something like sum of prime numbers? 11+5+7=23. Not 8.\n\nMaybe output is something like number of letters when spell out numbers? 11 (\"eleven\" 6 letters) +196 (\"one hundred ninety six\"? many)...\n\nLet's examine all pairs:\n\n(11,196,5,64,7)->8\n(9,36,13,400,25)->6\n(17,6,19,324,15)->18\n(3,81,11,16,21)->4\n(35,225,27,4,41)->2\n\nMaybe output maybe number of composite numbers? First: composites: 196,64:2. Output 8.\n\nMaybe output maybe product of something? 196/4=49; 64/8=8.\n\nPerhaps each output is number of letters of something? Maybe find two numbers per line that sum to output? e.g., 196-11=185; not 8.\n\nMaybe the output is difference between sums of first two vs last two? Let's compute sums: 11+196=207; 5+64+7=76; diff 131.\n\nNot.\n\nMaybe output is count of prime digits across all numbers? Let's check first: digits: 1,1,1,9,6,5,6,4,7 => primes digits: 1? 1 not prime. 9 not. 6 not. 5 yes. 4 not. 7 yes. So 2 prime digits. Not 8.\n\nMaybe output is number of letters if numbers spelled in Roman numerals? 11 XI (2 letters) 196 CXCVI (5?) Actually 196 = CXCVI (5 letters). 5 V (1). 64 LXIV (4). 7 VII (3). Sum letters 2+5+1+4+3=15. Not 8.\n\nMaybe output is something like count of distinct prime factors of product? The product is huge.\n\nAlternatively maybe it refers to something like \"how many letters are common between words\"? This seems too open.\n\nLet's find patterns: Output values: 8,6,18,4,2. They are all even numbers: 2,4,6,8,18. 18 is outlier. Maybe rule involves multiples? Maybe sum of numbers that are perfect squares? Let's compute squares: which are squares? 196,64,36,400,25,81,16,4. Summing squares per input:\n\nFirst case squares sum: 196+64=260\nSecond: 36+400+25=461\nThird: 324 =324 sum=324\nFourth: 81+16=97\nFifth: 225+4=229\n\nNow outputs are 8,6,18,4,2. Maybe output is sum of digits of those sums? For first: 260 sum digits=2+6+0=8 OK matches. Second: 461 sum digits=4+6+1=11 not 6. So maybe not.\n\nCheck sum of digits of product of squares? Too big.\n\nCheck sum of all numbers that are perfect squares: first:260 => sum digits 8 matches. second: 461 sum digits 11. Output 6, not match.\n\nMaybe sum of digits of difference between largest square and smallest square: For first: largest=196, smallest=64 diff 132 sum digits 6? Actually digits 1+3+2=6 not 8.\n\nMaybe product of something? Hard.\n\nMaybe output equals number of prime numbers with prime digits? e.g., 11 has prime digits 1? no. 196 etc.\n\nLet's look at each input: maybe output is count of numbers that are divisible by 3? First: 11 no,196 no,5 no,64 no,7 no => 0 not 8.\n\nCount numbers that are perfect squares: first 196 and 64 =>2. output 8 maybe 4*2? Not.\n\nHow about count of numbers that are squares or squares' multiples? 196=14^2, but 14 is composite; 64=8^2. maybe output = count squares * something? 2 squares -> output 8 maybe 4*2? But for second case squares: 36,400,25 =3 squares -> output6: 2*3 =6. For third case squares: 324 =1 square -> output 18: 18/1=18 not consistent.\n\nMaybe output equals sum of number of letters in \"square\"? No.\n\nNotice third output 18 is big; number of squares there is 1. maybe output equals sum of digits of that square: 324 digits sum 3+2+4=9, times 2=18. So pattern: output = sum of digits of largest square times 2? For first: largest square 196 digits sum 1+9+6=16. But output 8. Not match.\n\nOther: second largest square 400 digits sum 4+0+0=4. times something? Output 6.\n\nMaybe output equals number of distinct prime factors of the largest number? Largest numbers: first 196 prime factors 2,7 2 factors. Output 8.\n\nNot.\n\nMaybe output equals product of number of factors of each perfect square? 196 has 9 divisors, 64 has 7 divisors? product 9*7=63 . Output 8? Not.\n\nMaybe output = difference between counts of even and odd numbers? Count evens: 196,64,? 5 odd,7 odd. evens=2 odds=3 difference -1? absolute=1 not 8.\n\nMaybe output equals number of letter 'a' when spelling numbers? Not.\n\nI think the rule could be something like: output = number of letters in the name of the largest number when spelling in words? Largest numbers: 196 \"one hundred ninety six\" counts letters maybe 18? Actually \"onehundredninetysix\" letters count? Let's count: one(3) hundred(7) ninety(6) six(3)=19? plus maybe space? Not 8.\n\nSecond largest 400 \"four hundred\" letters 4+7=11? Output 6.\n\nMaybe output equals number of distinct prime numbers encountered? Let's list primes: first: 11,5,7 distinct primes 3. maybe also 2 because 196 and 64 contain 2? output 8? Not.\n\nPotentially the rule is: output is number of letters in the month corresponding to the first number? 11 corresponds to November (8 letters). Next number 196 maybe day? Not.\n\nMaybe it's counting something else: The instruction maybe something like \"Count the number of letters in the spelled-out first number that are vowels\"? 11 \"eleven\" vowels e e e ->3. Not 8.\n\nBut for first output 8 equal to number of letters in \"eleven\" 6? no.\n\nCould be \"count of letters that are symmetrical\" etc.\n\nHowever we see outputs 2,4,6,8,18. Only 18 is odd. Maybe the rule is: output equals sum of digits of the product of squares? For third case product of squares =324= 18? Wait 324 sum digits 9, but output 18.\n\nMaybe output = sum of digits of the sum of numbers that are perfect squares? Sum of squares for third case: 324 sum digits 9 *2=18. For first: sum squares 260 sum digits 8 *1=8. For second: sum squares 461 sum digits 11 *? to get 6 maybe divide by? 11-5=6? For fourth: sum squares 97 sum digits 16/4=4? hmm.\n\nObserving: 461 sum digits 11 output 6 difference 5? 461-400=61? 6+?\n\nMaybe output equals sum of digits of sum of squares minus number of squares? For second: sum squares 461 sum digits 11 minus number squares 3 =8 not 6.\n\nMaybe output equals sum digits of sum of squares modulo something: 11 mod5=1? no.\n\nWait think about each case: 1st: squares 196 and 64<|channel|>final<|message|>**Answer**\n\nThe odd‑ball (the one that does **not** fit) is the last one:\n\n> **35, 225, ",
