Repo for "Do explanations generalize across large reasoning models?"
ArXiv Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11517

## Repository Status

This repository is currently being cleaned and updated. The contents presently consist of raw dumps from two separate forked repositories that were used during our research. If you want to use this immediately (whether the data or the RL trained models or other additional questions), contact me at pal.k@northeastern.edu.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories corresponding to the datasets we worked with:

### Medcalc-Bench

Originally forked from: https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/MedCalc-Bench

All newly developed code related to this dataset is located in the evaluation/ folder.

### Instruction-Induction

Originally forked from: https://github.com/orhonovich/instruction-induction

Additional scripts and related code have been added directly within this directory.
