His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

Identify the components of the APACHE II score: age, 12 physiology parameters (including temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, PaO2, pH, creatinine, sodium, potassium, white blood cells, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematocrit).

Calculate each parameter's score:\\n - Age: 60 years (score 2).\\n - Temperature: 37.2\u00b0C (score 1).\\n - Heart Rate: 95 bpm (score 1).\\n - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculated from BP 135/75.

APACHE II uses pH and PaO2 together. Since pH is <7.35, and PaO2 might be low due to A-a gradient, but without exact PaO2 value, it's challenging. If we proceed with available data, total score might be around 12-14. However, standard APACHE II requires PaO2. Since it's missing, the score can't be fully accurate. But based on given data, approximate score is 12-14. The question might expect using available parameters. Let's recalculate without PaO2: sum all except PaO2: 2+1+1+1+0+3+3+0+0+1+1+0 = 13. Adding respiratory rate (0) and assuming PaO2 score 0, total 13. But APACHE II includes PaO2 as a separate parameter.

To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

However, the RR interval isn't provided. Wait, the user might have intended to use a simplified method. Alternatively, sometimes a fixed addition like +20 is used, but that's not standard. Wait, no\u2014the standard Bazett formula requires the heart rate to calculate the RR interval. Let me recalculate properly. Heart rate (HR) is 46 bpm.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the formula QTc = QT + 20 when HR is below 60? No, that's not correct. The correct approach is using Bazett: QTcB = QT / \u221a(RR). So step-by-step: 1. Convert HR to RR interval: 60/46 \u2248 1.304 sec. 2. Square root of RR: \u221a1.304 \u2248 1.142. 3. Divide QT by that: 330 / 1.142 \u2248 289 msec. But some sources might round differently. Alternatively, maybe the user expects a different approach? Wait, perhaps they confused the formula with Fridericia's? Fridericia uses cube root: QTcF = QT/(RR)^1/3. Let me check again.

She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution ().

VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond.

Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Model": "/medcalc-llama-3-1b-inst-grpo", "LLM Answer": "44", "LLM Raw Thinking": "The patient's serum sodium level is 148 mmol/L\nCorrected Anion Gap (AG) = Sodium - (Chloride - Bicarbonate) = 148 - (110 - 6) = 148 - 104 = 44", "LLM Explanation": "44", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "22", "Target Explanation": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, first determine the anion gap (AG) using the formula: AG = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). The given values are sodium 148 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. Plugging in the numbers: AG = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 mEq/L. However, the question specifies the 'albumin-corrected delta gap,' which typically requires adjusting the AG for hypoalbuminemia. The formula for albumin-corrected AG is: Corrected AG = Measured AG + (2.5 \u00d7 (4.0 - Serum Albumin in g/dL)). The patient's serum albumin is 4.2 g/L, which converts to 4.2 g/dL (since 1 L = 10 dL, but the units here are likely a typo; assuming 4.2 g/dL). Plugging in: Corrected AG = 32 + (2.5 \u00d7 (4.0 - 4.2)) = 32 + (2.5 \u00d7 -0.2) = 32 - 0.5 = 31.5 mEq/L. However, the original AG reported in the note is 22, conflicting with the calculation. The question might be asking for the delta gap (AG - Normal AG), but the term 'albumin-corrected delta gap' is unclear. Given the confusion, the primary AG calculation here is 22 as stated in the note, so the delta gap would be 22 - 12 (normal AG) = 10. However, the question might require using the formula with the given values. Given the ambiguity, the most straightforward answer using the provided AG of 22 and correcting for albumin: Corrected AG = 22 + (2.5*(4.0 - 4.2)) = 22 - 0.5 = 21.5. But the question might have intended the standard AG calculation. The note states AG is 22, so delta gap is 22-12=10. However, the term 'albumin-corrected delta gap' is not standard, so likely the corrected AG is 21.5, delta gap 9.5. But the question might just want the AG value given, which is 22.", "Ground Truth Answer": "28.95", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

Patient has hypertension", "LLM Explanation": "Patient has hypertension", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "1", "Target Explanation": "The Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) is used to assess the severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The key components include systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), hemoglobin, BUN, comorbidities, and other factors. The patient's SBP is 130 mmHg (normal is \u2265100 mmHg), HR is 88 bpm (normal is \u2265100 for points), BUN 18 mg/dL (normal is <20 for no points), hemoglobin 13 g/dL (no drop mentioned). No comorbidities like cirrhosis or heart failure. Melena is present (indirect sign of bleeding). However, according to GBS criteria, melena alone isn't a direct point unless there's hemodynamic instability. Since SBP and HR are normal, no points for vital signs. BUN <20 gives 0 points. Hemoglobin stable gives 0. No other factors like syncope, require intubation, or need for vasopressors. Total GBS is 0-3 points, which would indicate low risk. However, specific GBS calculation requires precise criteria: Melena (1 point), SBP \u2265100 but <110 gives 1 point (here SBP is 130, so 0), HR \u2265100 gives 1 point (HR 88, so 0), BUN \u226520 (no), hemoglobin <12 (no). So total would be 1 point for melena. But some versions of GBS may not count melena alone. Need to confirm. Alternatively, if melena is considered as 'visible blood' or melenic, it might add 1. However, without more data like hemoglobin drop or BUN elevation, the score is likely 1. But some sources say melena alone isn't enough. Wait, GBS criteria: The presence of melena alone (without\u5455blood) gives 1 point. So total score would be 1. However, some versions might require more. Alternatively, if the BUN is normal, and vitals normal, maybe 0. Need to check exact GBS points. According to the GBS calculator: Melena (1), systolic BP 130 is \u2265100 so 0, HR 88 is <100 so 0, BUN 18 <20 (0), hemoglobin 13 (no drop, 0). No comorbidities. So total is 1. But some sources say melena is 1 point. Hence, the score is 1. However, some guidelines might categorize melena as part of the bleeding manifestation but not add points unless other criteria. Wait, the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (2019 version) assigns 1 point for melena (as a sign of lower GI bleed?), but the GBS is more for upper GI. Wait, the patient has melena which could be upper or lower. However, the GBS is primarily for upper GI bleeding. Since the patient has peptic ulcer (upper GI source), melena is relevant. The GBS 2019: For upper GI bleed, melena is 1 point. So total score would be 1. However, if the BUN is normal and vitals are stable, maybe total is 1. But let me recount: Glasgow-Blatchford components (2019): 1. Systolic BP <90: 3 points; 90-100: 2; \u2265100:0. Here 130, so 0. 2. HR \u2265100: 1 point. Here 88, so 0. 3. BUN \u226520: 1 point. Here 18, so 0. 4. Hemoglobin <9: 2 points; 9-11:1 point. Here 13, so 0. 5. Coma, syncope, require intubation, or vasopressors: none, 0. 6. Melena (without\u5455blood): 1 point. So total is 1. Therefore, the score is 1. But some sources might have variations. Alternatively, if the presence of melena is part of the 'bleeding' but not adding points beyond the initial. Wait, the GBS calculator online: Let me think again. According to the GBS calculator, the points are: Melena (1), so with that and stable vitals, the total is 1.

However, FIB-4 is typically used in adults, especially over 18, and may not be valid for a 2-year-old. Despite this, calculating as requested: (1094)/(60,600,000) \u2248 0.000018. This result is extremely low, likely due to the young age and high platelet count. However, the question asks for the calculation regardless of clinical validity.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.169", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * \u221aALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 87.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 104.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 101000.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 101000.0 count/\u00b5L of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 101000.0 platelets count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 101000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 101000000000.0/(10^9) = 101.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (2 * 87.0)/(101.0 * sqrt(104.0)) = 0.169.\nHence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 0.169.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}
