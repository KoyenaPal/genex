A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours.

The Framingham Score assesses 10-year cardiovascular disease risk based on age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status. Let's break down each component: 1. **Age**: The patient is 50 years old. For men, each year over 50 adds points. At 50, the base score is 1 point. 2. **Gender**: Men start with 1 point. 3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP is 131 mmHg. The target range is <120. Each 10 mmHg above 120 adds 1 point. 131 - 120 = 11, so 1 point. 4. **Total Cholesterol**: LDL is 107 mg/dL. The optimal is <100. For every 10 mg/dL above, add 1 point. 107 - 100 = 7 \u2192 0.7 points, rounded to 1 point. 5. **HDL Cholesterol**: HDL is 43 mg/dL. Optimal is >60. For every 10 mg/dL below, add 1 point. 60 - 43 = 17 \u2192 1.7 points, rounded to 2 points. 6. **Smoking**: 3-pack year history. Each pack year adds 1 point. So 3 points. Adding these: 1 (age) + 1 (gender) + 1 (BP) + 1 (cholesterol) + 2 (HDL) + 3 (smoking) = 9 points. Referring to the Framingham table, 9 points correspond to a 10-year risk of ~15-20%. However, the note mentions a NSTEMI, which might affect the score. But the standard calculation doesn't include acute events like NSTEMI unless part of the history. Since the patient's risk factors are as listed, the score remains 9.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution ().

Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis.

Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles.

She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l.

Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table .

However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis.

Determine the difference between serum albumin and calculated albumin.\\n2. Multiply this difference by the serum osmolality.", "Target Model": "open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B", "Target Answer": "-133", "Target Explanation": "The problem requires calculating the patient's albumin-corrected delta gap in mEq/L. First, I need to recall what the anion gap (AG) is and how it's calculated. The AG is determined by subtracting the measured anions (chloride and bicarbonate) from the measured cations (Na+). The formula is AG = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-). The delta gap refers to the difference between the calculated AG and the measured AG. Albumin correction adjusts the delta gap for changes in albumin levels because albumin contributes to the osmotic balance and can affect the AG. The formula for albumin-corrected delta gap is (measured AG - calculated AG) \u00d7 (40 / [4.3 \u00d7 (albumin - 3.5)]), where 40 is a constant, 4.3 is the approximate molar ratio of albumin to other proteins, and 3.5 is the baseline albumin concentration assumed when albumin is not measured. Looking at the patient's data: Measured AG is 22. Calculated AG would be Na+ (148) minus (Cl- 110 + HCO3- 6) = 148 - 116 = 32. So the delta gap is 22 - 32 = -10. Then apply the albumin correction. Albumin is 4.2 g/L. Plugging into the formula: (-10) \u00d7 (40 / (4.3 \u00d7 (4.2 - 3.5))) = (-10) \u00d7 (40 / (4.3 \u00d7 0.7)) \u2248 (-10) \u00d7 (40 / 3.01) \u2248 (-10) \u00d7 13.29 \u2248 -132.9 mEq/L. However, since the question asks for the delta gap, which is the difference before correction, the answer is -10 mEq/L. But wait, the problem might be asking for the albumin-corrected delta gap. Let me check the exact wording: 'albumin corrected delta gap'. Yes, so the calculation includes the correction. Therefore, the final answer is approximately -132.9 mEq/L. However, the options or possible answers might require rounding. Checking the data again: AG = 22, calculated AG = 32, delta gap = -10. Albumin is 4.2. Using the formula: (-10) * (40 / (4.3*(4.2-3.5))) = (-10)*(40/(4.3*0.7)) = (-10)*(40/3.01) \u2248 (-10)*13.29 \u2248 -132.9. Rounding to one decimal place, -133.0 mEq/L. But let me confirm if the formula uses 40 or 40.0. The standard formula uses 40. So yes, the calculation is correct. The answer should be -133 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "28.95", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

She has no history of heart failure, chest pain, or dyspnea. Her vital signs are stable, and she has good oxygenation. The cardiac risk index requires evaluating several factors: age, cardiac history, pre-existing conditions, and other risk factors. Age \u226570 years adds 1 point. No history of heart failure, angina, or prior MI means no points here. Chronic diabetes is considered a major risk factor (1 point). Hypertension is not mentioned, but her BP is 130/85, which might be within normal range, so no points. Creatinine 120 \u00b5mol/L suggests chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a major risk factor (1 point). Total score: 1 (age) + 1 (diabetes) + 1 (CKD) = 3. However, the revised Cardiac Risk Index may have different criteria. Wait, the original CRI uses age \u226570, hypertension, heart failure, angina, prior MI, diabetes, CKD, and others. Let me check each component again. The patient has a stroke, not a myocardial infarction. So no points for heart failure or MI. Diabetes is present, so 1 point. CKD (creatinine 120) is a major risk factor (1 point). Age 81 is \u226570, so another point.

Therefore total points: age (1), diabetes (1), CKD (1) \u2192 total 3. But wait, some sources say CKD is a major risk factor (1 point) regardless of stage. Creatinine 120 is stage 3 CKD (GFR 30-59). So yes, CKD is a major factor. Thus, the total is 3. However, the revised CRI might have different thresholds. For example, in some versions, CKD is considered a major risk factor (1 point) if eGFR <60. Since 120 \u00b5mol/L corresponds to eGFR around 40-50, which is stage 3b CKD. So CKD is included.

Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

Physical exam shows enlarged tonsils with exudates, bilateral anterior cervical lymph nodes, and normal oxygen saturation. Lab results include elevated WBC with lymphocytosis, elevated CRP, and liver enzymes. The neck ultrasound and CT show lymphadenopathy. The FeverPAIN score assesses risk of severe bacterial infection requiring hospitalization. Key components are fever duration, age, immunocompetence, and presence of certain signs. The patient is immunocompetent (previously healthy), age 3 (risk factor for severe disease). Fever duration is 3 days. Other criteria: no rash, no systemic symptoms (weight loss, night sweats), no neck stiffness, no sick contacts. Lymphadenopathy is present but not suppurative or large. No other high-risk features. Score calculation: FeverPAIN uses a formula: Score = (Fever days - 1) + (if age <1 year: 1 else 0) + (if immunocompromised: 1 else 0) + (if any of: rash, systemic symptoms, neck stiffness, sick contacts, or lymphadenopathy with suppuration or size >2cm: 1 else 0).

He has atrial fibrillation, which is a major risk factor for stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score assesses stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The components are: Congestive heart failure (0), Hypertension (1), Age \u226575 (2), Diabetes mellitus (1), prior Stroke/TIA (1), Vascular disease (1), Age 65-74 (1). However, the note mentions he has hypertension and diabetes, so those contribute 1+1=2. Since he is 83, age \u226575 adds 2. He has atrial fibrillation, which is already considered in the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Wait, but the score includes AF as part of the criteria. Let me check the exact breakdown. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is calculated as follows: C (Congestive heart failure) - 0, H (Hypertension) -1, A (Age \u226575) -2, D (Diabetes) -1, S (Prior stroke/TIA) -1, V (Vascular disease) -1, A (Age 65-74) -1. But if the patient has AF, it's already included in the score. Wait, no\u2014AF is considered separately. Wait, the CHA2DS2-VASc score includes AF as a separate component. So the total is calculated as: For each of the following factors: Congestive heart failure (0), Hypertension (1), Age \u226575 (2), Diabetes mellitus (1), Prior stroke/TIA (1), Vascular disease (1), Age 65-74 (1). If the patient has AF, they automatically get a point. But in this case, the patient has AF, so that's one point. Then add the other factors. The patient is 83, so age \u226575 gives 2. He has hypertension (1) and diabetes (1). He has atrial fibrillation (1). He has vascular disease? The note mentions atrial fibrillation, but no mention of vascular disease like carotid stenosis. The patient had a stroke (acute right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia), which would be a prior stroke/TIA (1). So adding up: AF (1) + age \u226575 (2) + hypertension (1) + diabetes (1) + prior stroke (1) = total 6. Wait, but let me confirm the exact criteria again. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is: C (0), H (1), A (\u226575:2), D (1), S (1), V (1), A (65-74:1). If AF is present, it's added as a separate point. So the calculation is: AF (1) + A (\u226575:2) + H (1) + D (1) + S (1) + V (1) = 1+2+1+1+1+1=7. But wait, the AF is already considered in the score. Wait, no\u2014the CHA2DS2-VASc score includes AF as a separate component. So the total is: AF (1) + age \u226575 (2) + hypertension (1) + diabetes (1) + prior stroke (1) + vascular disease (1) = 1+2+1+1+1+1=7. However, the patient's history includes atrial fibrillation, which is a major risk factor. But according to the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system, AF is already accounted for in the score. Therefore, the total would be: AF (1) + age \u226575 (2) + hypertension (1) + diabetes (1) + prior stroke (1) + vascular disease (1) = 7. However, the patient's history of atrial fibrillation is a known risk factor, but in the CHA2DS2-VASc, AF is already included. So the correct calculation is AF (1) + age \u226575 (2) + hypertension (1) + diabetes (1) + prior stroke (1) + vascular disease (1) = 7. But wait, the patient had a stroke (NIHSS 4 upon admission), which would count as a prior stroke/TIA (1). So adding all components: AF (1) + age \u226575 (2) + hypertension (1) + diabetes (1) + prior stroke (1) + vascular disease (1) = 7. However, some sources might consider AF as a separate component, but in the CHA2DS2-VASc, AF is included in the score. Therefore, the total is 7. But I need to verify the exact breakdown. Let me recheck: CHA2DS2-VASc: C (0), H (1), A (\u226575:2), D (1), S (1), V (1), A (65-74:1). If AF is present, add 1.

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively.

Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range.

The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention.

Adding those months: August (31-31=0), September (30), October (31), November (30), December (31), January (31). Total days in those months: 30+31+31+31+31 = 154 days. Then add the days from February 1 to February 9: 9 days. Total days: 13 + 154 + 9 = 176 days. Convert days to weeks: 176 / 7 \u2248 25 weeks (since 25*7=175 days), leaving 1 day. So the gestational age is 25 weeks and 1 day. However, sometimes gestational age is rounded up if the days exceed 3 or 4.

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7\u00b0F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m\u00b2. Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2. His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis.

Delta gap refers to the difference between the measured bicarbonate (HCO\u2083\u207b) and the calculated bicarbonate based on the anion gap. First, I need to identify the measured bicarbonate from the lab results. Looking at the blood chemistry section, serum bicarbonate is listed as 9 mmol/L. Next, calculate the anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = Na+ - (Cl\u207b + HCO\u2083\u207b). The values provided are Na+ = 137 mmol/L, Cl\u207b = 98 mmol/L, and HCO\u2083\u207b = 9 mmol/L. Plugging these into the formula: Anion Gap = 137 - (98 + 9) = 137 - 107 = 30 mmol/L. The standard bicarbonate (calculated bicarbonate) is typically derived from the anion gap. However, the exact formula for standard bicarbonate might vary, but a common approach is to use the formula: Standard Bicarbonate = 24 + Anion Gap. So, 24 + 30 = 54 mmol/L. The delta gap is the difference between measured HCO\u2083\u207b and standard bicarbonate: 9 - 54 = -45 mEq/L. Wait, but delta gap is often expressed as the absolute value, so it would be 45 mEq/L. However, the calculation here shows a negative value because the measured HCO\u2083\u207b is lower than expected. But the question specifies 'delta gap', which might refer to the difference regardless of direction. However, typically, delta gap is the measured minus the calculated, so -45 mEq/L. But the answer requires the magnitude? The problem statement doesn't specify, but the term 'delta gap' usually implies the absolute difference. However, checking the exact definition: Delta gap is the difference between actual bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate based on the anion gap. If the actual bicarbonate is lower than expected, the delta gap is negative. However, sometimes it's reported as the absolute value. The question says 'delta gap in mEq/L', so likely expects the numerical value without sign. Therefore, the answer is 45 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "18", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

Each system contributes a score from 0 to 4, and the total is the sum. Let's go through each component step by step. 1. **Respiratory (PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio):** The patient is on CPAP with FiO\u2082 54% and PaO\u2082 77 mmHg. The ratio is 77/0.54 \u2248 142.5. The normal range is \u2265300. Since it's below 300, we check the scale. The ratio between 101-150 gives a score of 1. So respiratory score is 1. 2. **Cardiovascular (Mean Arterial Pressure [MAP] and vasopressor use):** MAP is calculated as (DBP + 2/3 SBP). Here, SBP is not given, but DBP is 80 mmHg. If we assume SBP is higher, but since exact values aren't provided, perhaps we need to check if the patient is on vasopressors. The patient is on dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Vasopressor use indicates cardiovascular failure. The score for cardiovascular is determined by the number of vasopressors used. The formula is: if >2 vasopressors, score 3; if 2, 2; 1, 1; none, 0. Here, 4 vasopressors (dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) would give a score of 3. 3. **Hepatic (bilirubin):** Bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL. The normal range is <1.0. The scale for bilirubin is: >20 \u21924, 10-20\u21923, 5-10\u21922, 2-5\u21921, <2\u21920. Here, 1.7 is just over 1.0, so score 1. 4. **Coagulation (platelets):** Platelets are 180,000/\u00b5L. Normal is 150,000-400,000. Since it's within normal range, score 0. 5. **Renal (creatinine):** Creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL. Normal is <1.0.

The scale is: \u22645\u21924, 6-8\u21923, 9-12\u21922, 13-15\u21920. So score 0 here.

First, I'll identify each parameter required for the score. The parameters include age, acuity (time since symptom onset), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, serum creatinine, white blood cell count (WBC), and lactate levels (if mentioned). However, lactate isn't provided here. Let me check the note again for all necessary data. The patient is 73 years old. Acuity is 8 hours, which falls into the 'acute' category (less than 24 hours). GCS is 15 (normal). Respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg. Heart rate is 107 bpm. Temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (within normal range). Serum creatinine is 4.58 mg/dL. WBC is 15,105 cells/\u00b5L. Lactate isn't mentioned, so it's assumed to be normal (0-1.5 mmol/L). For age: 73 years corresponds to 3 points. Acuity: 8 hours is acute, so 3 points. GCS: 15 gives 0 points. Respiratory rate: 35 is above 24, so 2 points. Systolic BP: 138 is between 101-150, so 0 points. Heart rate: 107 is between 101-150, so 0 points.

Each drug has a specific conversion factor. For example, fentanyl transdermal patches are typically converted using a factor of 1:1 (1 mcg = 1 mg morphine), hydrocodone is about 1:3.3 (1 mg hydrocodone = 0.3 mg morphine), and fentanyl buccal is around 1:1.5 (1 mcg = 0.15 mg morphine). Starting with the Fentanyl patch: 60 mg per day. Since it's a transdermal patch, the conversion factor is 1:1. So 60 mg equals 60 mg morphine. Next, Hydromorphone: 20 mg three times a day. The conversion factor here is 1 mg hydro = 0.3 mg morphine. So each dose is 20 * 0.3 = 6 mg morphine. Three times a day would be 6 * 3 = 18 mg per day. Then, Fentanyl buccal: 30 mg twice a day. The conversion factor for buccal fentanyl is 1 mcg = 0.15 mg morphine. Wait, but 30 mg is 30,000 mcg. So 30,000 * 0.15 = 4,500 mg morphine. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. If 1 mcg fentanyl = 0.15 mg morphine, then 30 mg (which is 30,000 mcg) would be 30,000 * 0.15 = 4,500 mg. But maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, sometimes the conversion factors vary. Let me confirm: some sources say fentanyl buccal is 1:1.5 (1 mcg = 0.15 mg morphine). Yes, that's correct. So 30 mg is 30,000 mcg, so 30,000 * 0.15 = 4,500 mg. That's 4,500 mg of morphine equivalent from the buccal fentanyl. Adding all these up: 60 (patch) + 18 (hydro) + 4,500 (buccal) = 4,578 mg MME per day. Wait, but let me double-check each calculation to avoid errors. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg/day. Correct. Hydro: 20*3=60 mg hydro, 60*0.3=18. Correct. Fentanyl buccal: 30 mg is 30,000 mcg. 30,000 * 0.15 = 4,500. Yes. Total sum: 60+18=78; 78+4500=4578.

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", "Question": "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings.

The typical fertile window is around 14 days before the next expected period. Since her cycle is 29 days, subtracting 14 days from the last menstrual period (LMP) gives the approximate ovulation date. The LMP was October 11, 2020. Subtracting 14 days: October 11 minus 14 days equals September 28, 2020. Conception usually occurs around 2-3 days after ovulation, so adding 2 days would give the conception date. Adding 2 days to September 28: September 28 + 2 days = September 30, 2020. However, since the cycle length is 29 days, the next period is expected on November 9, 2020 (October 11 + 29 days). But this method might vary based on individual cycles. Another approach is using the midpoint between two periods. The next period after LMP is on November 9, 2020. The midpoint between October 11 and November 9 is approximately October 25, 2020. Adding 14 days to the LMP (October 11 +14=October 25) or midpoint (October 25) plus 14 days would be November 8, but this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the correct method is to calculate the day 14 days before the next expected period. If the cycle is 29 days, the next period is October 11 +29 days = November 9. So ovulation is around 14 days before November 9, which is October 25. Then conception is 2-3 days after, so October 27 or 28. But the initial calculation gave September 30. There's confusion here. Let me recheck. If the cycle is 29 days, the average cycle length is 29 days. The LMP is October 11. The next period is October 11 +29 days = November 9. Ovulation typically occurs 14 days before the next period, so November 9 -14 days = October 25. Then conception is 2-3 days after ovulation, so October 27 or 28. Therefore, the answer should be October 27, 2020. But earlier calculation suggested September 30. Which is correct? The error comes from different methods. The standard method is that conception occurs around 14 days before the next period. So if the next period is November 9, then ovulation is October 25, conception October 27.

Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition.

Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient\u2019s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient\u2019s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L.

The initial ECG showed ST-segment changes, and despite normal coronary angiography, the clinical scenario suggested possible Brugada syndrome. However, the ajmaline test didn't show typical coved patterns, leading to exclusion of the diagnosis. The HEART score assesses risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with syncope and ST-elevation. The components include age, QTc interval, heart rate, ECG findings (ST elevation, left bundle branch block), and presence of syncope. The patient is 35 years old (low risk), no QTc prolongation (as potassium and magnesium were normal), heart rate was low (90/60), ST-segment changes in inferior leads (mild risk), no left bundle branch block, and syncope (moderate risk).

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation.

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 \u00b5mol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient\u2019s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site.

The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance.

First, I check the patient's age, gender (which is female here), and other risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, smoking, etc. The patient is 67 years old, female, has hypertension (taking medications), no history of diabetes, no smoking, normal lipid levels (cholesterol 196 mg/dL, LDL 110 mg/dL, HDL 50 mg/dL). Blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, which is stage 1 hypertension. BMI is 33, which is obese. The resting ECG is normal. Since she doesn't have diabetes, we don't add points for that.

But wait, let me confirm the exact points breakdown. Age 67: 1 point (since 60-69 is 1). Hypertension: 1 point. Obesity (BMI 33): 1 point. Smoking: 0. Diabetes: 0. So total 3 points. Looking at the Framingham tables, 3 points for women would indeed be approximately 10% risk. However, some sources might use different categorizations. Another consideration: the patient is postmenopausal? The original Framingham study didn't account for menopausal status, so if she's premenopausal, maybe no adjustment. But since her age is 67, likely postmenopausal, but the question doesn't specify. Assuming standard calculation without menopausal adjustment, the score remains 10%.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Correct"}

He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L.
