His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years.

There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation.

She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72\u2013141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.\nOn day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.\nOn day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31\u2013123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5\u201316.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37\u201347); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative.

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "name 'N' is not defined", "Ground Truth Answer": "28.95", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications.

Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d).

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis.

Subtract: 150.3 \u2013 104.8 = 45.5 mmol/L. 7. The anion gap is therefore approximately 45.5 mEq/L (rounded to 46 mEq/L).", "Ground Truth Answer": "39.2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 5.8 mEq/L) = 39.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 39.2 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 \u03bcg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.\nConcurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention.

In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41\u03bcg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.\nOn the basis of the patient\u2019s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection.

He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ).

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse.

The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2. His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics\u2014diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration\u2014are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection.

The patient\u2019s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient\u2019s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17\u20131.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5\u20136.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient\u2019s mental status gradually and steadily improved.

To convert 40.2 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin.

To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm\u00d72.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain ().

Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type.

Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.\nHe came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.\nOn exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7\u00b0F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air.

At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.\nHe underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole.

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 12.949 mL/min.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation.

The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b", "LLM Answer": "71", "LLM Raw Thinking": "Need maintenance fluid calculation.\nUse Holliday-Segar: 100 mL/kg for first 10 kg, 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg, 20 mL/kg for >20 kg.\nPatient weight?

However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient\u2019s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient\u2019s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient\u2019s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).\nDischarged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management.

The delta gap is 8.8 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point.

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 \u00b5mol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient\u2019s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L.

A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 \u2212 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 \u00d7 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient\u2019s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ).

The answer is 7.5 mEq/L.\\n\\nAnswer: 7.5 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted.
