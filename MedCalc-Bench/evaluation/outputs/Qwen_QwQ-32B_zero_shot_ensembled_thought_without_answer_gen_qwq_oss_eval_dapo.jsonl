His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L.

The APACHE II score has three components: age, chronic health conditions, and 12 physiologic variables measured in the first 24 hours. Since this is an ED presentation, likely using admission values.

To calculate PaO2. Actually, we may not have PaO2, but we have ABG pH of 7.32. That alone doesn't give us PaO2. The A\u2013a gradient of 364 and FiO2 55% (0.55) would allow us to estimate alveolar O2 concentration (PAO2) using the alveolar gas equation: PAO2 = FiO2 * (Patm \u2013 PH2O) \u2013 (PaCO2 / (1 \u2013 FiO2)) Alternatively, since A\u2013a gradient is PaO2 \u2013 PAO2 and we know A\u2013a gradient = 364.

The patient's height is given in inches, and their target BMI is 19.7 kg/m\u00b2. I need to find their target weight in kilograms. First, I remember that BMI is calculated as weight divided by height squared, using meters for height and kilograms for weight. But the height here is in inches, so I need to convert that to meters first. Hmm, right, the conversion from inches to meters. I know that 1 inch is 2.54 centimeters, so maybe I can convert inches to centimeters first and then to meters. Let me do that. 77 inches multiplied by 2.54 cm per inch. Let me calculate that: 77 * 2.54. Let's see, 70 inches would be 177.8 cm (since 70*2.54), and 7 inches is 17.78 cm, so total is 177.8 +17.78 = 195.58 cm. Wait, actually, 77 times 2.54. Let me do it directly: 77 * 2.54. Let's compute that. 70*2.54 is 177.8, and 7*2.54 is 17.78, adding them gives 177.8 +17.78 = 195.58 cm. So that's 1.9558 meters because 1 meter is 100 cm. Now, the BMI formula is BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2. The target BMI is 19.7, so rearranging the formula to solve for weight: weight = BMI * (height)^2.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

So min(x,1) = 1 because it's >1; max(x,1) = 12.714.\n\nNow compute min(x,1)^\u03b1 = 1^(-0.329) = 1.\n\nThen max(x,1)^-1.209 = (12.714)^-1.209. Compute: 12.714^-1.209. Let's estimate: 12.714^1.209 = exp(1.209 * ln(12.714)). ln(12.714) \u2248 2.544. Multiply by 1.209 \u21d2 3.078. exp(3.078) = 21.7. So 12.714^1.209 \u2248 21.7. Then inverse: 1/21.7 \u2248 0.0461.\n\nMultiply by constant 141: 141 * 0.0461 = 6.5061.\n\nNow factor 0.993^Age. Age 38: 0.993^38 \u2248 exp(38 * ln(0.993)) \u2248 38 * (-0.007034) = -0.267; exp(-0.267) = 0.7658.\n\nMultiply by 6.5061 * 0.7658 = 4.983.\n\nNow adjust for female: multiply by 1.018 \u21d2 4.983 * 1.018 = 5.071.\nNo race factor as she is not Black: multiply by 1."}

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.\nThe patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 \u00d7 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5\u201311.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0\u201316.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5\u20131.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73\u2013393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().\nGiven the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft.

First, I should recall what the Fever PAIN score is for. From what I remember, FeverPAIN is a scoring system used to assess the risk of necrotizing soft tissue infections , like necrotizing fasciitis. The components are F for Fever (temperature), E for elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis), A for absent pulses, P for pain out of proportion to exam, I for induration, and N for age > 55? Let\u2019s..?\u2026...\u2026..\u2026\u2026 Wait, maybe I need to check the exact components again. Alternatively, maybe it's F for Fever, E for elevated WBC, A for Altered mental status, P for Pain, I for Inflamm ation (like induration), and N for Neutrophils. Hmm, I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe the FeverP ain score is for streptococcal pharyngitis? That's different. There's also a FeverPAIN score for sore throat severity? No, I think the question here refers to the one for necrotizing soft tissue infections. Let me try to recall the FeverPAIN criteria. The FeverPAIN score is used to assess necrotizing soft tissue infections , specifically for the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The components are: - F: Fever (temperature \u2265 38\u00b0C ) - E: Elevated white blood cell count (WBC \u2265 1 100? Actually more like WBC > 12 000? Wait check: It's > 10,000 maybe) - A: Absence of distal pulse in the affected limb (if applicable) - P: Pain out of proportion to physical findings - I: Induration - N: Nausea/vomiting or other systemic symptoms Wait, perhaps the letters stand for different things. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe it's F for Fever, E for elevated WBC, A for Anemia, P for Pulmonary involvement, I for Inflammation , N for Non-inhibitor? This is not right. Alternatively, maybe it's F for Fever, E for elevated WBC, A for Age > 55, P for Pain severity, I for Infection severity, N for Neutrophilia? This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's the FEVER score, but the question specifies Fever PAIN. Wait, perhaps the FeverPAIN score is actually the F -P-A-I-N score, but that's a pain assessment tool. Alternatively , let's check the components: It might be: Fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0C), Elevated WBC (> 10,000), Absence of pulses , Pain out of proportion to exam, Induration, and Necrosis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the FeverPAIN score is F (Fever), E (Elevated WBC), A ( Age > 55), P (Pain), I (Induration), N (Nausea/vomiting). But I'd need the exact guidelines. Let's recall: There's a scoring system called \"FeverPAIN\" used in necrotizing fasciitis, where each letter stands for a component : F = Fever, E = Elevated WBC, A = Absent pulses, P = Pain out of proportion to exam, I = Induration /erythema, N = Nausea/Vomiting. The total score is calculated by adding points for each present criteria, with certain thresholds indicating higher risk. Alternatively, I found in some sources that the Fever PAIN score is: 1 point each for fever >38\u00b0C, leukocytosis >10,000, pain out of proportion, and pur ulence or imaging evidence, etc. But the full details are not clear. Alternatively, maybe it's the FEVER score: F for Fever, E for Erythema, V for Vesicles, E for Edema , R for Rapid progression. But the question specifies FeverPAIN. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the FeverPAIN score is used in the context of \"soft tissue\" infections, specifically \"necrotizing fasciitis ,\" with the components: F = Fever >38\u00b0C, P = Pain , A = Absence of pulses, I = Induration, N= Nausea and vomiting , E = Elevated WBC. The scoring system goes: Fever (\u226538\u00b0C) = 1, P = Pain disproportionate to exam =1, A = Absent pulse (if applicable)= 1, I = Induration on exam =1, N = Nause a or vomiting =1 , E = Elevated WBC > 10, 000 =1. The total score would be sum of these, with score > 4 indicating high risk for necrotizing fasciitis . Alternatively, perhaps the FeverPAIN score is a different scoring system. Let's check: There's a \"FeverPAIN\" score used for the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections which includes the following components: - Fever \u2265 38\u00b0C - Elevated white blood cell count > 10 ,000 - Pain out of proportion to examination - P = Pur ulent discharge or necrosis - A = Absent peripheral pulses - I = Induration or edema - N = Nausea or vomiting It seems the given case is a hydrogen peroxide ingestion with gastric pneum atosis and possible perforation, but the question is about the FeverP AIN score. Wait, but maybe I'm getting the context wrong. The patient's problem here is related to ingestion of hydrogen peroxide leading to gastric perforation, etc., but the question asks for the patient's FeverPA IN score. But perhaps the FeverPA IN score is applicable here? That score is specifically for necrotizing fasciitis, but this isn't a skin infection. Hmm, maybe the question is referring to another score? But the task is clear: \"What is the patient's FeverPAIN score ?\" Given all the confusion, I will assume it is the necrotizing fasciitis FeverPAIN score, even though the case doesn't involve that. Alternatively, perhaps the FeverPAIN score refers to a different system , like the PAIN score (Pain, Altered level of consciousness , Increased pulse rate, Nausea/vomiting), but with Fever added. But I'm still not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the FeverPAIN is a scoring system for other conditions. Let's check: There's a \"FeverPAIN\" score used for the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections, which includes the following elements: Fever > 38\u00b0C (1), Elevated WBC > 10, 000 (1), Pain out of proportion to exam (1), Absence of pulses (1), Induration or edema (1), and Nausea or vomiting (1). Each component is worth 1 point. The total score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating higher risk. Given that, let's go through the patient's details to assess each component: - Fever: The case notes mention nothing explicit about the patient's temperature. There's no mention of fever or a recorded temperature. The vitals show blood pressure 157/84, RR 20, pulse 65, SpO2 98% on RA. No mention of temperature, so we cannot say they had a fever. So Fever component: 0. - Elevated WBC: The lab results show a leukocyte count of 18.9 \u00d7 10^3 K/mm3, which is above 10.0 \u00d7 10^ 3. So Elevated WBC = 1. - Pain out of proportion : The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, and mouth/throat burning. No mention of severe pain or pain out of proportion to exam. So Pain out of proportion =0. - Absent pulses: Not applicable ; no mention of pulses or limb involvement. So absent pulses =0 . If nothing, it's 0. - Induration / edema: No mention of induration or edema on exam. So 0. - Nause a or vomiting: The patient had nausea and vomiting, so Nausea /Vomiting =1.", "Ground Truth Answer": "1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's current FeverPain score is 0.\nWhether the patient has a fever in the past 24 hours is not reported and so we assume that it is absent for the patient.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L).

Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment.

On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL.

To convert 120.0 \u00b5mol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic\u2013antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear\u2013antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", "LLM Name": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Thinking": " <think>Okay, so I need to figure out the patient's albumin-c orrected delta ratio.

The problem is that the baseline albumin isn't provided in the patient note . Let's see\u2026\u2026 ... The\u2026... This\u2026... The patient's current albumin is 3.8 g/dL. The previous creatinine was 1.15 mg/dL, but we don't have previous albumin. The question. Actually... The task is to compute the albumin-corrected delta ratio, which requires both current and baseline creatinine and albumin. Since the baseline albumin isn't given in the note, maybe the question intends using the current values only? But that wouldn't make sense. Let's review the definition: The albumin-corrected delta ratio (AC DR) is defined as (\u0394SCr/\u0394Alb) where \u0394 SCr is the change in serum creatinine and \u0394Alb is the change in serum albumin, both relative to baseline. However, without the baseline albumin level, this calculation can't be done accurately. The patient's baseline albumin is not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe there is a standard assumption or the question intends using the current values only? But that would not be appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, expecting the answer to be \u201cundefined\u201d or \u201ccannot be computed.\u201d I think ... Let's proceed... The patient's current creatinine is 10.48 mg/d L, baseline 1.15, so \u0394SCr = 9 .33. The current albumin is 3.8 g/dL ; no baseline albumin is provided. However, the user might have intended to use another formula? Let's check the possibility that the albumin-corrected delta ratio is defined as (current creatinine / current albumin) - (baseline creatinine / baseline albumin). That would require baseline albumin. We don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick to see if you realize the data is missing. But maybe the question expects using the current albumin and assuming baseline albumin in normal 4.0. But that assumption is unwarranted. The question says \"What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?\" That implies it can be calculated from the given data. Let me recheck the note. The patient's albumin is 3.8 g/dL , and the previous creatinine was 1.15 mg/dL . The note doesn't mention baseline albumin.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.25", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L.

Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.5 - 12 = 0.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.5 mEq/L / 2.0 mEq/L = 0.25.

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis.

Let's do that.  \nlog10(14 .6) \u2248 1.164.  \nActually log10(14 .6) is about 1.164.  \nSo ln(14. 6) \u2248 2.683.  \n2.683 * - 1.154 \u2248 -3.097.  \nActually that's the natural log exponent: e^-3.097 = ... That's about 0.045.  \nLet me do the power correctly using a calculator or manually approximate: 14.6^(-1.154) = 1 / 14.6^1.154.  \n14 .6^1.154 = e^(1.154 * ln( 14.6)).  \nln(14.6)=2.683.  \n1.154* 2.683=3.097.  \ne^3.097=22 .164.  \n1/22.164.  \n~0.0451 .\n\nNow Age^(-0.203).  \nln(27)=3.296.  \n-0. 203 * 3.296 = -0.669.  \ne^-0 .669=0.512.  \nSo age factor is ~0.512 .\n\nNow multiply: 175 * 0.0451 * 0 .512.  \n175*0.0451=7.8925 .  \nMultiply by 0.512=4.041 .  \nNow female factor: * 0.742 => 4.041 * 0.742=3.0?  \n4.041*0. 7=2.8287.  \nAdd 4.041*0. 042=0.1697 => sum ~2.9984.  \nAfrican American factor: *1.212 => 3.0 * 1.212=3.636.  \n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalc with the factor 1.212?  \nUsually the factor is 1. 212, but some use 1.210.  \nVariation small."}

His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 \u03bcg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.\nConcurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed.

The anion gap is calculated as [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]). Using the initial labs from the local hospital: Na = 141 mEq/L, Cl = 104 mEq/L, HCO3 = 29 mEq/L. Anion gap = 141 - (104 + 29) = 8 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is 8-12, so the delta gap formula is (Anion Gap - Normal AG) - (24 - HCO3). Plugging in values: (8 - 12) - (24 - 29) = (-4) - (-5) = 1 mEq/L. However, since the anion gap is within normal range (8), the delta gap is not typically calculated here. Alternatively, using later labs (admission to Children's Hospital): Na=134, Cl=104, HCO3=22. Anion gap = 134 - (104 +22)=8. Delta gap: (8-12) - (24-22)= -4 -2= -6.

The patient's given heart rate is 79 bpm, and the measured QT interval is 330 msec. First, I should confirm the exact formula for Rautaharju. From what I recall, Rautaharju's formula is different from the others because it uses a linear adjustment instead of a square root or cube root like Bazett or Fridericia. Let me see... I think the formula is something like QTc = QT + 0. 154*(HR - 62), but I might be mixing it up. Wait, maybe it's adjusted in a different way. Let me check my memory again. Alternatively, I might have it wrong. Another version I've heard of is that Rautaharju's formula is QTc = QT interval + 0.154 \u00d7 ( 60 \u2013 RR\u2013\u2026\u2026. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Hmm, maybe it's based on the RR interval instead of the heart rate directly. Since heart rate and RR interval are related. The RR interval is the time between heartbeats, which can be calculated as 60 / HR given HR in bpm. So let's just use the heart rate here. Wait, perhaps the Rautaharju formula is QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (Heart Rate - 70).\u2026\u2026. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's QTc = QT / (1 + 0.005*(HR-60)). Let's reason. The question says \"Using the Rautaharju Formula for corrected QT interval , what is the patient's corrected QT interval in terms of msec?\" So we have to compute with given HR 79 bpm and QT 330 m Sec. Alternatively, perhaps the Rautaharju formula is given by: QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-60 ). Let's check and compute that. The heart rate is ... We need ... etc\u2026. The ... ... ... So just ... ... Wait, maybe the correct formula is QTc = QT + 0 .154 \u00d7 (HR - 60). ... So let's apply this... Let me think step by step. Suppose the formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60).

But wait, I'm not 100% sure if that's the actual Rautaharju formula. Let\u2019s verify. Alternatively, maybe it's QTc = QT + 0.18 5 \u00d7 (HR - 62). Or perhaps another version. Alternatively, maybe the formula is: QTc = QT + 0 .154 \u00d7 (HR - 60) only for certain ranges. But the general idea might be that it\u2019s a linear correction. Alternatively, maybe the Rautaharju formula is actually QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (RR\u22121000). Since RR interval is in milliseconds, but here HR is given as 7 9 bpm. So RR interval in msec is 60000 /79 \u2248 760.95? Wait 60000/79 is about 760.95? Let's calculate. 79*700=55300, 79*50=3950 total 59250, 79*5.95=469 => total 59719? Let's do precisely: 60,000 /79 \u2248 759.49 msec. So RR interval is about 759 ms. Then Rautaharju formula might be QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (RR\u22121000). That would be 330 +0.154 \u00d7 (759-1000 )=330+0.154\u00d7(-241)=330-37.074 =292.926 ms. That\u2019s far from 333. So unclear . Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let's check known formulas: - Bazett: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR) - Fridericia: QTc = QT / ( RR^(1/3)) - Hodges: QTc = QT + 1.75*(HR-60) - Rautaharju: QTc = QT + 0.154 * (HR-60) (some reference). So maybe the given earlier is correct. Alternatively, according to some sources, Rautaharju's formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-62). That would yield 330 +0.154*(79-62)=330 +0.154*17=330+2.618=332. 618 \u2192 333 ms. The difference from 333 vs 332. 6. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-60) for HR>70, else QT + 0.154*(HR-70). Possibly. But given the data, we assume HR=79 >70. So we have 330+0.154*19=332.926~333 . Hmm. The question is, which exact formula is correct here? Many references: Rautaharju et al. (1987) found a new formula: QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR -70). Wait some say 70. This difference is small. Let's pick 70. Then 79-70=9. =>0 .154*9=1.386 =>330+1.386= 331.386~331. But the initial mention was HR-60. Possibly confusion. Many references: Rautaharju et al. (1987) found \"QTc=QT +0.154 [HR-70]\". That would be used.

Hmm, maybe it's based on the RR interval instead of the heart rate directly. Since heart rate and RR interval are related. The RR interval is the time between heartbeats, which can be calculated as 60 / HR given HR in bpm. So let's just use the heart rate here.\n\nWait, perhaps the Rautaharju formula is QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (Heart Rate - 70).\u2026\u2026. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's QTc = QT / (1 + 0.005*(HR-60)). Let's reason. The question says \"Using the Rautaharju Formula for corrected QT interval , what is the patient's corrected QT interval in terms of msec?\" So we have to compute with given HR 79 bpm and QT 330 m Sec.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Rautaharju formula is given by: QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-60 ). Let's check and compute that. The heart rate is ... We need ... etc\u2026. The ... ... ... So just ... ... Wait, maybe the correct formula is QTc = QT + 0 .154 \u00d7 (HR - 60). ... So let's apply this... Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose the formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). Then plugging in the values: QT is 330, HR is 79. So (HR-60)=19. Then 0.154*19 = let's calculate that ... \n\n?We\u2026\u2026. The ... ... ... So ... ...?... So 0.154 multiplied by 19. Let's compute 0.154 \u00d7 20 = 3. 08, so subtract 0.154 gives 3. 08 -0.154 = 2.926 . \n\n? ... So ... The ... ... ... So ... Let's ... So the addition would be 330 + 2.92 6 = 332.926. \n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure if that's the actual Rautaharju formula. Let\u2019s verify. Alternatively, maybe it's QTc = QT + 0.18 5 \u00d7 (HR - 62). Or perhaps another version. Alternatively, maybe the formula is: QTc = QT + 0 .154 \u00d7 (HR - 60) only for certain ranges. But the general idea might be that it\u2019s a linear correction. Alternatively, maybe the Rautaharju formula is actually QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (RR\u22121000). Since RR interval is in milliseconds, but here HR is given as 7 9 bpm. So RR interval in msec is 60000 /79 \u2248 760.95? Wait 60000/79 is about 760.95? Let's calculate. 79*700=55300, 79*50=3950 total 59250, 79*5.95=469 => total 59719? Let's do precisely: 60,000 /79 \u2248 759.49 msec. So RR interval is about 759 ms. Then Rautaharju formula might be QTc = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (RR\u22121000). That would be 330 +0.154 \u00d7 (759-1000 )=330+0.154\u00d7(-241)=330-37.074 =292.926 ms. That\u2019s far from 333. So unclear . \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let's check known formulas: \n- Bazett: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR)\n- Fridericia: QTc = QT / ( RR^(1/3))\n- Hodges: QTc = QT + 1.75*(HR-60)\n- Rautaharju: QTc = QT + 0.154 * (HR-60) (some reference). So maybe the given earlier is correct. Alternatively, according to some sources, Rautaharju's formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-62). That would yield 330 +0.154*(79-62)=330 +0.154*17=330+2.618=332. 618 \u2192 333 ms. The difference from 333 vs 332. 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR-60) for HR>70, else QT + 0.154*(HR-70). Possibly. But given the data, we assume HR=79 >70. So we have 330+0.154*19=332.926~333 . \n\nHmm. The question is, which exact formula is correct here? Many references: Rautaharju et al. (1987) found a new formula: QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR -70). Wait some say 70. This difference is small. Let's pick 70. Then 79-70=9. =>0 .154*9=1.386 =>330+1.386= 331.386~331. But the initial mention was HR-60. Possibly confusion. Many references: Rautaharju et al. (1987) found \"QTc=QT +0.154 [HR-70]\". That would be used. So I'd compute 330 +0.154*( 79-70)=330+0.154*9=330+1 .386=331.386~331."}

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7\u00b0F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m\u00b2. Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2. His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride.

Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

The patient\u2019s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient\u2019s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17\u20131.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5\u20136.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient\u2019s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Name": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "LLM Answer": "4.7", "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the delta gap, first determine the anion gap (AG) using the formula: AG = Na + K - (Cl + HCO3).

Let me recall what the Child-Pugh Score entails. From what I remember, the Child-Pugh Score is used to assess the severity of liver disease, particularly in cirrhosis. The score is calculated from 5 clinical and laboratory parameters: total bilirubin , albumin, INR, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Each parameter is assigned a score from 1 to 3, and the total score is used to categorize the patient as Child-Pugh class A, B, or C. First, I need to go through each of the five parameters and find the corresponding values from the patient note. Let's start with each component one by one. 1. **Total Bilirubin **: The note mentions bilirubin is 40.2 umol/L. Wait, I need to check the units. The note says bilirubin 40.2\u00b5mol/L. Hmm, I remember that the Child-Pugh criteria use mg/dL for bilirubin \u2026. We need to convert? We. Actually\u2026 Let me confirm the exact units. The standard Child-Pugh criteria use total bilirubin in mg/dL. The cutoffs are: - 1 point for < 2 mg/dL - 2 points for 2-3 mg/dL - 3 points for >3 mg/dL Wait, but the given value is in \u00b5mol/L. I need to convert 40.2 \u00b5mol/L to mg/dL. Conversion 1 mg/dL = 17.1 \u00b5mol/L. So\u2026 2. **Albumin **: The albumin level is given as 3.1 g/dL. The cutoffs for albumin in Child-Pugh are: - 1 point for \u22653.5 g/dL - 2 points for 2.8 to 3.4 g/dL - 3 points for < 2.8 g/dL 3. **INR (Prothrombin Time) **: The note says INR 2.1. The cutoffs for INR are: - 1 point for INR \u2264 1.7 - 2 points for 1.7-2.3 - 3 points for > 2.3 Wait, let me recall exactly. Let me think. The typical ranges for INR are: - 1 point if INR < 1.7 - 2 points if INR 1.7-2.3 - 3 points if INR > 2.3 4. **Ascites **: The abdominal exam notes \u201cnegative for ascites.\u201d So that means no ascites. The Child-Pugh ascites scoring is: - 1 point for no ascites - 2 points for mild ascites (responding to diuretic therapy) - 3 points for refractory ascites requiring TIPS, paracentesis, etc. 5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) **: The patient is oriented only to self. That\u2019s a sign of encephalopathy. So we need to determine if it\u2019s mild or moderate. According to the Child-Pugh scoring, hepatic encephalopathy is scored as: - 1 point for no encephalopathy - 2 points for grade I-II encephalopathy - 3 points for grade III-IV encephalopathy or refractory to therapy The note says the patient is oriented only to self, which might suggest grade II (confusion, disorientation, but can still be roused) or grade I (subtle changes like euphoria, slurred speech, etc.). However, the exact grading can be tricky. The presence of asterixis (which is present here) is also a sign of HE. **Now let\u2019s sum our points**. The Child-Pugh classification is: - 5-6 points: Class A (mild) - 7-9 points: Class B (moderate) - 10-15 points: Class C (severe) However, the question asks for the Child-Pugh score (the total points), not the class.", "Ground Truth Answer": "8", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current child pugh score is 0.\nThe patient's INR is 2.1. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol. To convert 40.2 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 8.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "ensembled_thought_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "Okay, so I need to calculate the Child-Pugh Score for this patient.  \nLet me recall what the Child-Pugh Score entails.  \nFrom what I remember, the Child-Pugh Score is used to assess the severity of liver disease, particularly in cirrhosis.  \nThe score is calculated from 5 clinical and laboratory parameters: total bilirubin , albumin, INR, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.  \nEach parameter is assigned a score from 1 to 3, and the total score is used to categorize the patient as Child-Pugh class A, B, or C.  \n\nFirst, I need to go through each of the five parameters and find the corresponding values from the patient note.  \nLet's start with each component one by one.  \n\n1. **Total Bilirubin **: The note mentions bilirubin is 40.2 umol/L.  \nWait, I need to check the units.  \nThe note says bilirubin 40.2\u00b5mol/L.  \nHmm, I remember that the Child-Pugh criteria use mg/dL for bilirubin \u2026.  \nWe need to convert? We. Actually\u2026 Let me confirm the exact units.  \nThe standard Child-Pugh criteria use total bilirubin in mg/dL.  \nThe cutoffs are:  \n   - 1 point for < 2 mg/dL  \n   - 2 points for 2-3 mg/dL  \n   - 3 points for >3 mg/dL  \n\nWait, but the given value is in \u00b5mol/L.  \nI need to convert 40.2 \u00b5mol/L to mg/dL.  \nConversion 1 mg/dL = 17.1 \u00b5mol/L.  \nSo\u2026  \n\n2. **Albumin **: The albumin level is given as 3.1 g/dL.  \nThe cutoffs for albumin in Child-Pugh are:  \n   - 1 point for \u22653.5 g/dL  \n   - 2 points for 2.8 to 3.4 g/dL  \n   - 3 points for < 2.8 g/dL  \n\n3. **INR (Prothrombin Time) **: The note says INR 2.1.  \nThe cutoffs for INR are:  \n   - 1 point for INR \u2264 1.7  \n   - 2 points for 1.7-2.3  \n   - 3 points for > 2.3  \nWait, let me recall exactly. Let me think. The typical ranges for INR are:  \n   - 1 point if INR < 1.7  \n   - 2 points if INR 1.7-2.3  \n   - 3 points if INR > 2.3  \n\n4. **Ascites **: The abdominal exam notes \u201cnegative for ascites.\u201d  \nSo that means no ascites.  \nThe Child-Pugh ascites scoring is:  \n   - 1 point for no ascites  \n   - 2 points for mild ascites (responding to diuretic therapy)  \n   - 3 points for refractory ascites requiring TIPS, paracentesis, etc.  \n\n5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) **: The patient is oriented only to self. That\u2019s a sign of encephalopathy.  \nSo we need to determine if it\u2019s mild or moderate.  \nAccording to the Child-Pugh scoring, hepatic encephalopathy is scored as:  \n   - 1 point for no encephalopathy  \n   - 2 points for grade I-II encephalopathy  \n   - 3 points for grade III-IV encephalopathy or refractory to therapy  \nThe note says the patient is oriented only to self, which might suggest grade II (confusion, disorientation, but can still be roused) or grade I (subtle changes like euphoria, slurred speech, etc.).  \nHowever, the exact grading can be tricky.  \nThe presence of asterixis (which is present here) is also a sign of HE.  \n\n**Now let\u2019s sum our points**.  \n\nThe Child-Pugh classification is:  \n- 5-6 points: Class A (mild)  \n- 7-9 points: Class B (moderate)  \n- 10-15 points: Class C (severe)  \n\nHowever, the question asks for the Child-Pugh score (the total points), not the class."}

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5\u2103. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm\u00d72.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of \u03b22-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

The goal is to calculate the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (M ME) based on the medications listed. First, I need to recall the conversion factors for each opioid mentioned. The drugs here are Fentanyl (both patch and buccal forms) and Hydromorphone.\n\nStarting with the Fentanyl patch. I remember that Fentanyl patches are typically converted to MME by multiplying the total daily dose by 300. Wait, actually, the conversion factor for Fentanyl transdermal is a bit different.

According to CDC, for Fentanyl patches, each mcg/hour is converted to MME by multiplying by 300. But the daily dose here is given in mg. Wait, the patient is taking 60 mg of Fentanyl patch once a day. Wait, actually, Fentanyl patches are usually in mcg/hour and the total daily dose is calculated based on the patch's strength. But in this case, the note says 60 mg of Fentanyl patch once a day. That seems very high because Fentanyl patches are typically in the range of 25 mcg/h to 100 mcg/h, which would translate to a total daily dose in milligrams . Wait, maybe the 60 mg is the total daily dose? For example, a 25 mcg/h patch delivers about 0.025 mg/hour, so over 24 hours, that's 0.025 *24 = 0.6 mg per day. So a 60 mg daily dose would be extremely high.

Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.\nHe came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.\nOn exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7\u00b0F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.\nChest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.\nHe underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.\nFollow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.\nHe was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics.

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The task is to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, taking into account adjusted body weight for BMI. The patient note gives actual weight 68 kg, height 168.0 cm. Let's calculate BMI: 68 kg / (1.68^2) = 68/(2.8224)=24.11. That's within normal range (18.5\u201324.9), so we need to set adjusted body weight to minimum of ideal body weight and actual weight. First compute ideal body weight for male: 50 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet. Height 168 cm = 5 '6\" (since 168 cm = 65.96 inches, so 5 feet 5.96 inches, so about 5 '6\"). So 6 feet is 72 inches. Wait, 168 cm is about 5.51 feet. Let's calculate precisely: 168 cm = 168/2.54 = 66.141 inches \u2248 66.1. Over 5 feet (60 inches), that's 6.14 inches. So ideal weight = 50 + 2.3*6.14 = 50 + 14.122 = 64.122 kg. Minimum of 64.1 kg and actual 68 kg is 64.1 kg. So adjusted body weight = 64.122 kg.

This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation.

{"Row Number": 334, "Calculator Name": "Maintenance Fluids Calculations", "Calculator ID": "22", "Category": "physical", "Note ID": "pmc-5970484-1", "Patient Note": "A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Name": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "LLM Answer": "71", "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight at admission is 30 kg.

No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition.

After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient\u2019s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient\u2019s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring.

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation.

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 \u00b5mol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient\u2019s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively.

The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored.

Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance.

First, we need to assign points for her age from the Framingham tables. Next, assign points for her total cholesterol based on her age category. Then, assign points for HDL cholesterol. After that, assign points for systolic blood pressure, considering that she is on treatment.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL.

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 \u00b5mol/L; normal 2.6\u201352.2 \u00b5mol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8\u20136.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5\u201314.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 \u00d7 109/L; normal 4\u201312 \u00d7 109/L), platelet count (23 \u00d7 109/L; normal 150\u2013400 \u00d7 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5\u20132.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150\u2013500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80\u20131.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16\u20130.48 g/L).

His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20\u201350 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 \u00d7 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 \u00d7 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient\u2019s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 \u2212 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 \u00d7 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient\u2019s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Name": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "LLM Answer": "14", "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap (delta gap), first determine the measured anion gap using the formula: Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-). The patient's values are Na 135 mmol/L, Cl 110 mmol/L, and HCO3 18 mmol/L. Calculated anion gap = 135 - (110 + 18) = 7 mEq/L. Since the patient has hypoalbuminemia (albumin 1.2 g/dL), the corrected anion gap is adjusted using the formula: Corrected AG = Measured AG + [2.5 \u00d7 (4.0 - Albumin)]. The correction factor is 2.5 \u00d7 (4.0 - 1.2) = 7.0. Adding this to the measured AG: 7 + 7 = 14 mEq/L. The term 'delta gap' here refers to the corrected anion gap.", "LLM Thinking": " <think>Hmm, I remember that the corrected anion gap is sometimes calculated when the albumin level is low because albumin contributes to the anion gap. Wait, actually, the delta gap is part of the anion gap and albumin correction used in evaluating metabolic acidosis, but maybe here they're referring to the corrected anion gap? The anion gap is normally calculated as (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)). But when albumin is low, like in hypoalbuminemia, the anion gap can be underestimated because albumin is an anion. The \"albumin-corrected anion gap\" formula adds a correction factor: 2.5*(normal albumin - measured albumin) to the anion gap. The normal albumin is usually considered 4 g/dL (or 4.4?). The correction factor is something like 2.5 mmol/L per gram decrease in albumin below normal. Corrected Anion Gap = Measured Anion Gap + (2.5 \u00d7 (4. 0 - Albumin [g/dL])) Because each gram per decil iter decrease in serum albumin below 4 g/dL is associated with a decrease of about 2.5 mmol/L in the anion gap . The delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the HCO 3- when there's metabolic acidosis. The delta ratio compares the anion gap to the drop in HCO3 - to see if it's a pure anion gap acidosis. But the question: \"What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?\" Hmm, maybe they want the corrected anion gap minus the HCO3? Wait, the delta gap is (Anion Gap - (18 - HCO3-)) or something like that? The delta ratio is (AG - 8) / (24 - H CO3) or something like that, but I'm getting confused here. Let's parse the question: \"What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?\" Maybe it's the corrected anion gap minus the normal anion gap, or perhaps just the corrected anion gap. But \"delta gap\" might be the difference between the measured anion gap ( or corrected) and the expected anion gap. I'm thinking they've incorrectly used \"delta gap\" here, but perhaps they just want the corrected anion gap. But let's compute: The given lab values include Na+ 135 , Cl- 110, HCO3- 18. So measured anion gap = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is about 8-16, so this is low. Albumin is 1.2 g/dL (low ). The normal albumin is 4.0 g/dL. Decrease is (4 - 1.2) = 2. 8 g/dL. Correction factor is 2.5 \u00d7 2.8 = 7 .0. Alternatively, the delta gap is sometimes calculated as AG - (18 - HCO3), but in this case, since HCO 3 is 18, 18 - 18 =0. So AG - 0 = AG.", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL.

The LMP given is August 22, 2014 , and the cycle length is 27 days. First, I remember that typically, pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the LMP \u2026...>\u2026\u2026..? But conception itself usually occurs around two weeks after the LMP, right? Because ovulation typically happens about 14 days before the next period is due. So if the cycle is 27 days long, then ov ulation would be around day 13 or 14 of the cycle , maybe? Wait, let me think again. The cycle length is from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. So if the cycle is 27 days, ov ulation would be approximately 14 days before the next expected period. So the LMP is 8/22/2014 , so the next expected period would be 27 days later, which would be 9/18/2014 (since August has 31 days, so adding 27 days to 8 /22: 8/22 + 27 days is August 22 plus 9 days to August 31 (9 days), then 18 more days into September \u2013 yep 9/18 /2014? ...\u2026\u2026.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. The typical pregnancy due date is calculated by adding 280 days ( 40 weeks) to the LMP. Conception usually occurs about two weeks after the LMP, since ovulation is around that time. So , the conception date is approximately two weeks after the LMP plus the cycle length, ....\u2026\u2026..?...\u2026... This\u2026... ...\u2026\u2026. So the LMP is 8/22, so adding 1 4 days would be 9/5. But wait, since the cycle length is 27 days, ovulation occurs around day 13 or 14 (since 27 -14 = 1 3? Wait, the formula is ovulation typically occurs around day 1 /2 of cycle length? Sorry\u2026.... Actually... We\u2026... The standard approach is that ovulation occurs about 14 days before the next period. So next period is LMP + cycle length. That's 8/22 + 27 days =..., ... etc.. So next period starts on 9/18. 14 days before that is 9/4. Let me double-check the math. Adding 27 days to August 22: August has 31 days. From August 22 to August 3 1 is 9 days. 27-9=18 days left, so September 18. So next period is 9/ 18. Subtract 14 days: 9/18 minus 14 days is 9/4. So yes, that's ...\u2026? ...\u2026\u2026.

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted.

The acronym stands for History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. The components are History (symptoms), ECG changes, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin levels. Each component is scored as low, medium, or high risk, and then summed up to get the total HEART score. The total score helps categorize the patient into low, intermediate, or high risk for ACS. Looking at the case, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. Let me go through each component step by step. First, History: The History component assesses the characteristics of the chest pain. Pleuritic chest pain is sharp and pleuritic, which might suggest it's not typical cardiac pain. However, the HEART score's History component is scored based on whether the pain is typical, atypical, or non-cardiac. The patient's pain is described as pleuritic, which is more like non-cardiac, so that might be a low-risk factor here. Wait, the scoring for History is: 0 = typical, 1 = non-typical, 2 = non-cardiac ... I think there might confusion... Wait the HEART score's History component is scored as follows: 0 for typical, 1 for atypical, 2 for noncardiac. Wait, no, actually, the scoring might be different. Actually, in the HEART score, each component (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) is assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2, and the total ranges from 0-10. Wait, no, the HEART score is actually each component is scored as low, intermediate, or high risk, but the points are 0, 1, or 2 for each. Let me confirm the exact scoring: - **History**: - Typical (e.g., central chest pressure radiating to arm) = 0 - Atypical (e.g., burning) = 1 - Non-cardiac (e.g., pleuritic) = 2 - **ECG**: - Normal or non-diagnostic changes = 0 - Ischemic changes (e.g., ST depression, T-wave inversion) = 1 - Acute MI changes (e.g., ST elevations, new LBBB) = 2. Actually, normal =>0, non-diagnostic (like low voltage?) might be 1? Wait let's recall: 0 = normal, 1 = non-specific changes (like T wave inversion, ST depression), 2 = definite ischemic changes like ST elevation or new LBBB or pathological Q waves). But let's check standard: In HEART, ECG: 0 = normal, 1 = non-specific ST-T changes, 2 = definite ischemic changes like new ST depression or new LBBB. So normal = 0, non-specific =1, definite ischemia =2. - **Age**: 0 = <45, 1 = 45-65, 2 = >65 - **Risk factors**: 0 = no risk factors, 1 = 1-2 risk factors, 2 = \u22653 risk factors or history of CAD. - **Troponin**: 0 = normal, 1 = elevated but not above 3x ULN, 2 = >3x ULN. Wait the troponin component is: 0 = normal, 1 = 1-3x ULN, 2 = >3x ULN The total ranges 0-10. Low risk =0-3, medium =4-6, high =7-10. The HEART score categorizes patients into low (0-3), intermediate (4-6), high (7-10). So the total score is the sum of each component's 0-2 points. The note says: initial troponin was 0.481 ng/mL, reference <0.012, but subsequently downtrended to <0.02. The maximum troponin level was 0.481, let's see how that compares to the ULN. The ULN is about 0.012 ng/mL for the assay used. 0.481 is 40x ULN (0.012*40 = 0.48). So that's >3x. So the troponin component would be 2 points (since 0.481 is way above 3x ULN). History: The chest pain is pleuritic, which is non-cardiac type, so History component is 2. ECG: The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltage. No diffuse ST elevations. The ECG result: \"normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations.\" That's not evidence of ischemia. So ECG would be normal. The standard is: low voltage on ECG might be considered a non-specific change, but generally the HEART score ECG component: 0 = normal, 1 = non-specific ST-T changes, 2 = definite ischemic changes like new ST depression or new LBBB. So low voltage alone is not an ischemic change; it's a normal ECG except low voltage which is non-specific. Hmm. Wait, the ECG description says \"low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations.\" That's not evidence of ischemia. So 0 points? Age points: Age <45? Actually it's 47, so age >45 but <=65. According to standard: Age 45-65 is 1 point. Risk factors: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and presumably hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin) but the note says LDL is 58 (so maybe well-controlled). However, for risk factors in HEART, the components are: 0 = no risk factors, 1 = 1-2 risk factors, 2 = \u22653 risk factors or history of CAD. Let's list risk factors: 1) Diabetes mellitus, 2) Hypertension, 3) Hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin), 4) age over 45 (but age is already a separate variable), 5) smoking status? Not mention.

Let's break it down \u2026assistantanalysisNeed to compute days between 2022-10-01 and 2023-06-13. Let's calculate: Oct 1-31:30? Actually days from Oct1 inclusive to end of month: Oct has 31 days, so from Oct 1 to Oct31 is 31 days, but since the LMP is 10/01, that's day 0. We count from 10/01 to 06/13 exclusive => difference is (2023-06-13 - 2022-10-01) in days.\n\nWait, let's compute using method: 2022-10-01 to 2023-06-13. Let's count month by month: October has 31 days (from 1 to 31), November 30, December 31, January 31, February 28 (2023 is not leap year?), Actually 2023 not leap year so Feb 28 days. March 31, April 30, May 31, and then 13 days of June. Let's just use full months and add days:\n\nWait, let's calculate step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a formula or a calculator approach. Let me think:\nassistantcomment aryWe need days between 10/01/2022 and 06/13/2023. Let's break into two parts: from 10/01/2022 to 12/31/2022, then from 01/01/2023 to 06/13/2023."}
