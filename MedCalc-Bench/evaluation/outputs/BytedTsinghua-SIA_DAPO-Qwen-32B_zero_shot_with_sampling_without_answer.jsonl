His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI.

Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.

We take the midpoint or a typical estimate as 7-10%.", "LLM Thinking": "Let's approach this step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the necessary information for calculating the Framingham Risk Score. The Framingham Risk Score is used to predict the 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The key factors needed are: 1. Age. 2. Gender. 3. Total Cholesterol. 4. HDL Cholesterol. 5. Systolic Blood Pressure. 6. Blood Pressure Treatment Status. 7. Smoking Status. 8. Diabetes Status. From the patient note, we have the following information: - The patient is 50 years old. - The patient is male. - Smoking status: The patient is a former smoker with a 3-pack-year smoking history. Typically, this might be considered a \"never smoker\" for risk calculation purposes unless otherwise specified whether the patient still smokes. Given the \"3-pack-year smoking history,\" it suggests that the patient has quit smoking or is not currently smoking. - The cholesterol values given are: - LDL = 107 mg/dL, - HDL = 43 mg/dL, - Triglycerides = 98 mg/dL, but total cholesterol is not directly given. To calculate total cholesterol, we use the formula: Total Cholesterol \u2248 HDL + LDL + (Triglycerides / 5) Using the given values: Total Cholesterol \u2248 43 (HDL) + 107 (LDL) + (98 / 5) Calculating the triglycerides term: 98 / 5 = 19.6 So, Total Cholesterol \u2248 43 + 107 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. We'll round this to 170 mg/dL for simplicity. - Blood pressure: 131/83 mm Hg (systolic BP = 131 mm Hg). - There is no mention of blood pressure medications, so we can assume no blood pressure treatment. - Diabetes status: The note specifically mentions that the patient has no history of diabetes. - The patient has a history of acute diverticulitis and a current episode of what seems like NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), but we will use the given information to calculate the base Framingham score for the prediction of future risk. Let's plug in the information into the Framingham Risk Score calculation. The patient's demographics and measurements are: - Age: 50 years. - Gender: Male. - Total Cholesterol: Approximately 170 mg/dL. - HDL: 43 mg/dL. - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg. - Blood Pressure Treatment: No (0 for no treatment). - Smoking: Former smoker (we'll assume non-smoker here). - Diabetes Status: No diabetes. To calculate the Framingham Risk Score for a man, we use the points assigned based on the following factors: 1. Age: - 50 years old Age 50 corresponds to 4 points. 2. Total Cholesterol: - 170 mg/dL The closest range in the Framingham table for total cholesterol is: - 160-199 mg/dL corresponds to 4 points. So, the cholesterol contributes 4 points. 3. HDL-Cholesterol: - 43 mg/dL The closest range for HDL is: - <40 mg/dL = 6 points. So HDL contributes 6 points since 43 mg/dL is just above 40, and we should look at the nearest range given the closest lower boundary. However, according to the actual framingham chart: HDL 40-49 contributes 0 points. Since 43 mg/dL falls in 40-49 mg/dL range it should get 0 points. So, HDL contributes 0 points. 4. Systolic Blood Pressure: - 131 mm Hg - Without treatment: - 120-129 mm Hg corresponds to 2 points. - 130-139 mm Hg corresponds to 3 points. - Since 131 mm Hg falls in the range 130 - 139 mm Hg, it corresponds to 3 points. So, systolic BP contributes 3 points. 5. Blood Pressure Treatment: - No - 0 points since no treatment. So, BP treatment contributes 0 points. 6. Smoking Status: - Former smoker (assuming non-smoker, as there is no information about current smoking) - Never smoked: 0 points. So, the smoking status contributes 0 points. 7. Diabetes: - No diabetes - 0 points. Now we add up all the points: \\[ \\text{Total Points} = \\text{Age Points} + \\text{Total Cholesterol Points} + \\text{HDL Points} + \\text{Systolic BP Points} + \\text{Blood Pressure Treatment Points} + \\text{Smoking Points} + \\text{Diabetes Points} \\] \\[ \\text{Total Points} = 4 (Age) + 4 (Total Cholesterol) + 0 (HDL) + 3 (Systolic BP) + 0 (BP Treatment) + 0 (Smoking) + 0 (Diabetes) \\] \\[ \\text{Total Points} = 4 + 4 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 11. \\] To convert these points into a 10-year risk percentage for CHD, we refer to the corresponding Framingham score conversion chart. However, keep in mind that the note indicates that the patient recently had an NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), which suggests a higher immediate cardiac risk than what the Framingham score might predict.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "Let's approach this step-by-step.  \nStep 1: Identify the necessary information for calculating the Framingham Risk Score.  \nThe Framingham Risk Score is used to predict the 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.  \nThe key factors needed are:  \n1.

However, APACHE II uses specific ranges and scores for each parameter. 2. **Let's breakdown each parameter one by one using the given data:** - **Age:** The patient is 60-years old. The APACHE II scoring system assigns points for age as follows: - 15-44 years: 0 points - 45-54 years: 1 point - 55-64 years: 2 points - 65-74 years: 4 points - 75-84 years: 6 points - 85 or older: 9 points. - **Glasgow Coma Score (GCS):** The patient has a GCS of 14. The APACHE II score\u2019s GCS categories and scores are: - 15: 0 - 14-13: 1 - 12-9: 2 - 8-6: 3 - \u22645: 4 - **PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 Ratio:** The patient has a FiO\u2082 of 55%, and we need to determine the PaO\u2082 value to calculate PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 (also called the P/F ratio). Given the A-a gradient is 364. We need more information to calculate the PaO\u2082 directly. However, since the A-a gradient is quite high (normal is usually <15, but it\u2019s dependent on age and FiO\u2082), we can infer the patient is having respiratory distress. Let\u2019s use the formula for A-a gradient, which is: A-a gradient = PAO\u2082 \u2013 PaCO\u2082 However, to use it properly, we need the partial pressure values of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. Let\u2019s assume that we can infer the PaO\u2082 indirectly from the context of severe respiratory distress. Since the calculation involves the A-a gradient, and without knowing the exact PAO\u2082 (alveolar oxygen tension), let\u2019s use the common interpretation that a very high A-a gradient likely means the patient has poor oxygen exchange efficiency. But for APACHE II, we need PaO\u2082 / FiO\u2082. If, hypothetically, we assume a typical value of PaO\u2082 for a patient with severe respiratory distress on supplemental oxygen: Let\u2019s calculate PAO\u2082 using: PAO\u2082 = (FiO\u2082 \u00d7 760) \u00d7 (P_atm \u2013 pH\u2082O) \u2013 (PaCO\u2082 / R / 0.8) But it is complex without PaCO\u2082. Given the high A-a gradient of 364, let\u2019s interpret the PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 indirectly: if FiO\u2082 is 0.55 (55%), a high A-a gradient might imply that PaO\u2082 is low.

Given BP 135/75 mm Hg. So, MAP = 75 + \u2153(135 \u2013 75) = 75 + 20 = 95 mm Hg.

Since no specific information is provided about cardiac arrest or abnormal rhythms, we will assume that the patient is without cardiac arrest or any severe cardiac issue requiring a score. - **Respiratory rate:** The patient has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths/minute.

Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion.

During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.", "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Name": "BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B", "LLM Answer": "9", "LLM Explanation": "In using the CKD-EPI Equation for a female with creatinine levels of 8.9 mg/dL, Serum Creatinine\u9ad8\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u503c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u80be\u5c0f\u7403\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7387\uff08GFR\uff09\u7ea6\u4e3a\u5927\u7ea610 to 9 m/min.1.73 m^2.", "LLM Thinking": "Step-by-Step thinking process to solve the question: 1.

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.\nThe patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 \u00d7 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5\u201311.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0\u201316.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5\u20131.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73\u2013393 U/L).

The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion.

Unfortunately, the actual fasting insulin level is never explicitly mentioned. It seems there's a critical piece of information missing: the fasting insulin level. But let's look if we can use any given information to make educated guesses or infer any data.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

ALP/ ULN = \\(\\frac{{ALP}}{{ALP_ULN}} \\approx \\(\\frac{1800 IU/L}{125 IU/L} = 14.4\\). Now, using the delta ratio formula: \\[ \\Delta \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{{\\left(\\frac{{GGT}}{{GGT ULN}}\\right)}}{{\\left(\\frac{{ALP}}{{ALP ULN}}\\right)}} = \\frac{{25}}{{14.4}} \\approx 1.74. \\] This ratio indicates a cholestatic process since it is greater than 1, suggesting that GGT elevations are more pronounced relative to ALP elevations, typical in cholestatic conditions.", "LLM Thinking": "Let's solve this step-by-step. We need to calculate the patient's delta ratio. The delta ratio is used to classify liver function problems as either hepatocellular or cholestatic. It is calculated using the following formula: Delta Ratio = (GGT / Upper Limit of Normal for GGT) / (ALP / Upper Limit of Normal for ALP). However, there's a slight mix-up \u2014 often, the term *delta ratio* usually refers to the AST/ALT ratio in certain contexts, but based on the provided information and the description of the liver functions, we'll assume that the question is asking about a ratio related to cholestasis given the elevated ALP and GGT values. But for a clearer understanding, we will use a commonly used way to differentiate between hepatocellular and cholestatic injury, which involves GGT and ALP levels. According to the information provided, let's identify key laboratory results: From the note on day 15: - GGTP: 878 IU/L - ALP: 388 IU/L From the values on day 36, the liver transplant center workup shows: - GGTP >1500 IU/L - ALP >1800 IU/L From the values on Day 54: - GGT >1500 IU/L (assuming GGT is the same as GGTP for simplicity, since they are measuring similar enzyme levels). - ALP >1884 IU/L Let's use the values from day 36 for calculation since they provide more extreme examples of elevated levels. The upper limits of normal for GGT and ALP typically vary by laboratory but are usually around: - GGT: 60 IU/L (male); for this case, we'll use an upper limit around 30-60 IU/L for females. - ALP: Around 100-125 IU/L. Let's use GGT ULN as 60 IU/L and ALP ULN as 125 IU/L for our calculations, as these are common reference ranges. Now, let's use the delta ratio formula: Delta ratio = (GGT / GGT_ULN) / (ALP / ALP_ULN). Using the upper limit of norms: GGT_ULN = 60 IU/L ALP_ULN = 125 IU/L Using the day 36 values where GGT > 1500 IU/L and ALP > 1800 IU/L, we'll use the minimum values within these ranges to calculate. GGT = 1500 IU/L ALP = 1800 IU/L Now plug these into the delta ratio formula: Delta ratio = (GGT / GGT_ULN) / (ALP / ALP_ULN) = (1500 / 60) / (1800 / 125). Calculate inside the parantheses first: 1500 / 60 = 25 1800 / 125 = 14.4 However, if we are looking at another approach called the Rosier's Index or the Goldman index to differentiate between hepatocellular and cholestatic processes, we use the following formula: Rosier's index = GGT / ALP Now let's use the same values GGT = 1500 IU/L and ALP = 1800 IU/L for this calculation: Since the standard interpretation is that if Rosier's Index > 2 it suggests cholestasis and if < 2, it suggests hepatocellular injury. In simpler terms, if we are calculating the \u0394Ratio or \"Delta Ratio\" that denotes the ratio between the increase of GGTP and ALP above their normal range: Let's use a formula for the delta ratio that involves: \\[ \\Delta \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{(GGT/ULN)}}{\\text{(ALP/ULN)}} \\] Using the values GGTP (GGT) = 878 (on day 15), ALP = 388 (day 15) Let's use the typical upper limits: GGT ULN = 60 IU/L ALP ULN = 125 IU/L Now let's calculate it for day 15: \\[ \\text{GGT / ULN} = \\frac{878}{60} \\approx 14.63 \\] \\[ \\text{ALP / ULN} = \\frac{388}{125}\\approx 3.104\\] To calculate the patient's 'delta ratio,' I used the values provided from different days. For the day 36 values: GGT (or GGTP) > 1500 IU/L and ALP > 1800 IU/L, along with reference ULNs of 60 IU/L for GGT and 125 IU/L for ALP. Using the values: GGT = 1500 IU/L and ALP = 1800 IU/L. We calculated: 1. GGT/ULN for GGT = 1500 / 60; 2. ALP / ULN for ALP = 1800 / 125.

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table .

However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis.

Given information includes: - The anion gap (AG) on admission = 22. - The serum albumin on admission is 4.2 g/dl. The formula to calculate the anion gap is: Anion Gap (AG) = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO\u2083]). From the note, we have the following lab values: - sodium (Na) = 148 mmol/L - chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L - bicarbonate (HCO\u2083) = 6 mmol/L. Let's calculate the anion gap using the given formula: \\[ AG = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO_3]) \\] Plugging in the numbers: \\[ AG = 148 - (110 + 6) \\] \\[ AG = 148 - 116 \\] However, the patient note indicates the anion gap as 22. There seems to be a discrepancy between the calculated AG and the reported one. Let's assume the reported AG is correct which is 22 mEq/L. The albumin-corrected anion gap formula is used because the anion gap can be influenced by the serum albumin level. The correction for albumin is given by the formula: \\[ \\text{corrected anion gap} = \\text{Anion Gap} + (4 \\times (\\text{Normal Albumin Level} - \\text{Patient's Albumin Level})) \\] The normal albumin level is generally taken to be 4 g/dL. Given: - the patient\u2019s albumin level = 4.2 g/dL - the normal albumin level is 4 g/dL. But let's use the correction formula to make sure. The formula becomes: \\[ \\text{Correction for albumin} = 2.5 \\times (\\text{Normal Albumin} - \\text{Patient\u2019s Albumin}). \\] This varies slightly but it is commonly known to be 2.5 or 2.4.

So, let's use the corrected anion gap we calculated, \u0394Gap = Albumin-corrected AG - Normal AG Since the normal AG is around 10-12, we\u2019ll use 12. Therefore, \u0394Gap = 21.2 - 12 But let's approach the other common method where we typically use the delta Gap. The calculated AG is 32 (from our calculation), Let's correct it for albumin. The albumin correction factor is 2.5 \u00d7 (normal albumin level - patient's albumin level). Let's apply this correction factor. Given: - Patient's albumin level = 4.2 g/dL. - Normal albumin = 4.0 g/dL. The delta gap will be the corrected AG - the normal AG. It appears there was some inconsistency as the provided Anion gap (22) from the patient history seems to be correct. So let's use the provided AG of 22 to calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

Thus the final Corrected Sodium value is the given measured value.", "LLM Thinking": "To approach this question step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the information provided. The patient has: - A blood sodium concentration (Na+) of 134 mEq/L. - The patient has symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and loose stools, and possibly other signs like tanned skin and bluish-black gums. The patient's vital signs and additional test results include: - Heart rate of 116/min. - Blood pressure of 85/46 mm Hg. - Normal findings from the physical exam other than described signs. We need to calculate the corrected serum sodium concentration. To do so, we must determine if any factors exist that require correction of the sodium level. The presence of conditions such as hyperglycemia or hyperproteinemia can affect serum sodium values, necessitating correction. From the lab results given: - Serum glucose = 70 mg/dL. - This glucose level (70 mg/dL) is within the normal range (normal fasting blood glucose is around 70-99 mg/dL for non-diabetic individuals), which indicates that hyperglycemia is not likely to be a factor requiring sodium correction. However, tanned skin and bluish-black gums might suggest a condition like Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or Addison's disease. Bluish-black gums could be a sign of melanin deposition, which is often associated with Addison's disease. Since the patient has symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, tanned skin (which suggests hyperpigmentation), and bluish-black gums, along with a possibly decreased blood pressure (85/46 mm Hg), there is a suspicion of secondary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease. In Addison's disease, cortisol and aldosterone production are reduced. Aldosterone deficiency can lead to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Next, let\u2019s check the lab values: - Serum potassium (K+) = 5.4 mEq/L (within the normal range or slightly elevated). - Serum sodium (Na+) = 134 mEq/L. Given that the sodium value is slightly on the lower side and the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Addison's disease, we also have to take into consideration the patient's heart rate (116 bpm), which may suggest dehydration or an acute phase response. Since hyperglycemia-induced correction does not seem applicable here due to the normal glucose levels, if we suspect a low plasma protein concentration (e.g., during dehydration), we would use the formula to adjust for hypoalbuminemia. However, typically in the context of serum sodium calculations and the given scenario of symptoms, we might need to think of other factors. The formula to correct the sodium concentration for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Na = Measured Na + (Glucose - 100) / 18 Given that the glucose is 70 mg/dL, this would not affect the sodium correction since glucose is less than 100. If we had evidence of hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels), we would use the following formula: Corrected Na \u2248 Measured Na + 1.6 (normal albumin - Measured Albumin) But the albumin level is not provided in the question, so we cannot apply this directly unless we assume normal albumin. However, without additional specific information about albumin or clinical context pointing to hypoalbuminemia (which might cause a decrease in sodium), let\u2019s analyze it further with the given data. Given that the serum potassium is elevated (5.4 mEq/L), and considering the symptoms (weight loss, fatigue), hyperpigmentation (tanned skin, and bluish-black gums), it is highly likely that this is Addison's disease. In Addison's disease, hyponatremia can often occur due to aldosterone deficiency. So the sodium value given (134 mEq/L) could already be affected by the condition but needs no correction due to glucose levels. To conclude based on the available information, since no adjustments are needed per the given hyperglycemia or the glucose levels provided, and without albumin data for hypoalbuminemia correction, the measured value would be considered.

Naegele's Rule states that to find the due date, you take the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), add 7 days to it, subtract 3 months, and then add one year if necessary. The patient's last menstrual period was on 02/03/2012 and has a cycle length of 28 days, which is the typical assumption used in Naegele's Rule. Step 1: Take the first day of the LMP which is 02/03/2012. Step 2: Add 7 days to this date: 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 02/10/2012. Step 3: Subtract 3 months from 02/10/2012. Subtracting 3 months from February 10th takes us back three months. If we subtract three months from February, we reach November of the previous year. Therefore, February 10, 2012, minus 3 months is November 10, 2011. But we made a mistake above. Subtracting 3 months from February 10th should take us to November 10th of the SAME year (not the previous year). So, if we subtract 3 full months from February 10th, 2012: February - March - April - May... But for simplicity of Naegele's rule calculation, it involves shifting the date backward three months and also ensuring we respect the annual cycle properly. To apply it correctly: Step 1: Identify the start date: 02/03/2012. Step 2: Add 7 days to 02/03/2012: \\[ 02/03/2012 + 7 \\, \\text{days} = 02/10/2012. \\] Step 3: Subtract 3 months from 02/10/2012. The month part: From February, subtract 3 months: 1. February - 1 month = January 2. January - 1 month = December 3. December - 1 month = November So subtracting 3 months from February: February 10th goes back 3 months to: February -> January -> December -> November. Thus, February 10, 2012, minus 3 months is: November 10, 2011. Step 4: Now that we subtract 3 months and go from 02/10/2012 to November 10, 2011, which does not seem correct since the due date usually should be in the future. The correct procedure involves adding 1 year after subtracting the 3 months if going backward results in an earlier year than the starting year. So, February 10, 2012 - 3 months = - If we subtract three months from February 10, 2012, we must count backward as follows: If we count the months: February 10 minus 1 month = January 10 January 10 minus 1 month = December 10 December 10 minus 1 month = November 10 But since November is earlier in the year than our chosen month in the problem, instead of going to an earlier year (which might be confusing), let us use an adjustment scheme by going through the months in a forward approach. To simplify it: Taking another approach: We'll follow the typical rule of adding a year after subtracting the months if it goes to earlier year. Let's apply it systematically step-by-step with adding the year concept: - The initial date is 02/03/2012 - Add 7 days to the LMP: 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 02/10/2012 Now subtract the 3 months from February 10, 2012: February 10, 2012 - 3 months Subtract 1 month: January 10, 2012 Another month: December 10, 2011 And one more month: November 10, 2011 Since we've ended up with November 10, 2011 which is actually 3 months earlier in that year, Now to reach back into the year forward by adding one year to the date: November 10, 2011 + 1 year = November 10, 2012.", "Ground Truth Answer": "11/09/2012", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's estimated due date based on their last period is computed by using Naegele's Rule.

", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "To calculate the patient's estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we must follow these steps:  \n1. Naegele's Rule states that to find the due date, you take the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), add 7 days to it, subtract 3 months, and then add one year if necessary.  \nThe patient's last menstrual period was on 02/03/2012 and has a cycle length of 28 days, which is the typical assumption used in Naegele's Rule.  \nStep 1: Take the first day of the LMP which is 02/03/2012.  \nStep 2: Add 7 days to this date: 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 02/10/2012.  \nStep 3: Subtract 3 months from 02/10/2012. Subtracting 3 months from February 10th takes us back three months.  \nIf we subtract three months from February, we reach November of the previous year. Therefore, February 10, 2012, minus 3 months is November 10, 2011.  \nBut we made a mistake above. Subtracting 3 months from February 10th should take us to November 10th of the SAME year (not the previous year).  \nSo, if we subtract 3 full months from February 10th, 2012:  \nFebruary - March - April - May...  \nBut for simplicity of Naegele's rule calculation, it involves shifting the date backward three months and also ensuring we respect the annual cycle properly.  \nTo apply it correctly:  \nStep 1: Identify the start date: 02/03/2012.  \nStep 2: Add 7 days to 02/03/2012: \\[ 02/03/2012 + 7 \\, \\text{days} = 02/10/2012. \\]  \nStep 3: Subtract 3 months from 02/10/2012. The month part: From February, subtract 3 months:  \n1. February - 1 month = January  \n2. January - 1 month = December  \n3. December - 1 month = November  \nSo subtracting 3 months from February: February 10th goes back 3 months to: February -> January -> December -> November.  \nThus, February 10, 2012, minus 3 months is: November 10, 2011.  \nStep 4: Now that we subtract 3 months and go from 02/10/2012 to November 10, 2011, which does not seem correct since the due date usually should be in the future.  \nThe correct procedure involves adding 1 year after subtracting the 3 months if going backward results in an earlier year than the starting year.  \nSo, February 10, 2012 - 3 months = - If we subtract three months from February 10, 2012, we must count backward as follows:  \nIf we count the months:  \nFebruary 10 minus 1 month = January 10  \nJanuary 10 minus 1 month = December 10  \nDecember 10 minus 1 month = November 10  \nBut since November is earlier in the year than our chosen month in the problem, instead of going to an earlier year (which might be confusing), let us use an adjustment scheme by going through the months in a forward approach.  \nTo simplify it: Taking another approach: We'll follow the typical rule of adding a year after subtracting the months if it goes to earlier year.  \nLet's apply it systematically step-by-step with adding the year concept:  \n- The initial date is 02/03/2012  \n- Add 7 days to the LMP: 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 02/10/2012  \nNow subtract the 3 months from February 10, 2012:  \nFebruary 10, 2012 - 3 months  \nSubtract 1 month: January 10, 2012  \nAnother month: December 10, 2011  \nAnd one more month: November 10, 2011  \nSince we've ended up with November 10, 2011 which is actually 3 months earlier in that year,  \nNow to reach back into the year forward by adding one year to the date: November 10, 2011 + 1 year = November 10, 2012."}

Step 1: Identify the elements of the Cardiac Risk Index (revised Cardiac Risk Index for pre-operative risk) to evaluate the given patient's risk. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index includes the following risk factors: - Age > 75 years. - History of ischemic heart disease (IHD) or angina. - Heart failure. - History of cerebrovascular disease in the last 6 months. - Renal insufficiency (defined by a serum creatinine level > 2 mg/dL, which corresponds to approximately 177 \u00b5mol/L). - Diabetes mellitus. - Pre-operative cardiac arrest. - Emergency surgery. - High-risk non-cardiac surgery. We will evaluate the patient's profile against these risk factors. Step 2: Evaluate each factor from the patient note. - Age > 75 years: Yes. The patient is 81 years old. - History of ischemic heart disease (IHD) or angina: The note does not mention ischemic heart disease or angina. - Heart failure: The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. - History of cerebrovascular disease in the last 6 months: The note mentions that the patient has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident but does not specify the timeline to the surgery. It states \"a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness,\" which implies it is not restricted to the last 6 months. - Renal insufficiency (creatinine > 2 mg/dL, or approximately > 177 \u00b5mol/L): The patient's creatinine level is 120 \u03bcmol/L. This is below 177 \u00b5mol/L, so it does not qualify as renal insufficiency according to this criterion. - Diabetes mellitus: Yes. She has chronic type 2 diabetes. - Pre-operative cardiac arrest: No mention of this. - Emergency surgery: The note specifies that the surgery is a \"scheduled\" high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery, indicating it is not an emergency surgery. - High-risk non-cardiac surgery: High-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery falls into the category of high-risk non-cardiac surgery. Now, let\u2019s count the number of risk factors that apply to this patient based on the revised Cardiac Risk Index. - Age > 75 years = 1 - Ischemic heart disease or angina = 0 - Heart failure = 0 - Cerebrovascular disease in the last 6 months = 0 (given the mention is not specifically within the last 6 months) - Renal insufficiency (creatinine > 177 \u03bcmol/L) = 0 (creatinine is 120 \u03bcmol/L) - Diabetes mellitus = 1 - Cardiac arrest = 0 - Emergency surgery = 0 - High-risk non-cardiac surgery = 1 Step 3: Interpret the Cardiac Risk Index for these factors.

This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 120.0 \u00b5mol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.014 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 120.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine/L converts to 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL.

Let\u2019s go through this step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the patient characteristics and laboratory findings from the given data: The patient is a 75-year-old female. 1. Age: Over 64 years old. 2. Resides in a nursing home (this suggests some degree of comorbidity and increased risk but is not directly a PSI criteria; however, it can be taken into consideration for overall risk assessment). 3. Medical history: Congestive heart failure. 4. No known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. 5. Vital signs: Body temperature = 36.5 \u00b0C (which is within the normal range), Pulse = 82 bpm, Respiratory rate = 22 breaths/min, BP = 128/80 mm Hg. 6. Lab values: - Hematocrit = 39%. - Glucose = 180 mg/dL (elevated). - BUN = 27 mg/dL (slightly high). - Sodium = 139 mEq/L (within normal limits). - Arterial blood gas: pH = 7.40, PaO2 = 80 mmHg. 7. CXR shows indications of pleural effusion. Next, let\u2019s apply the PSI criteria to determine the points for each. The Pneumonia Severity Index uses multiple parameters: - Demographics (age). - Comorbid conditions. - Vital signs. - Lab results. Let\u2019s break this down step by step: Step 1: Age. Age 75 years old. For ages: - 40\u201344 years old get 0 points. - 45\u201354 years old get 1 point. - 55\u201364 years old get 2 points. - 65\u201374 years get 3 points. - 75\u201384 years get 4 points. - Over 84 years get 5 points. Since the patient is 75 years old, she belongs to the age group 75\u201384 years, so she gets 4 points for age. Step 2: Comorbid conditions. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure. The comorbid conditions that add points include: - Chronic cardiac disease: 1 point. - Chronic lung disease (such as COPD): 1 point. - Liver disease: 1 point. - Connective tissue/immunosuppression: 1 point. - Renal failure (as determined by creatinine level): 1 point. - Cerebrovascular disease or dementia: 1 point. - Diabetes mellitus: 1 point. - Previous influenza or pneumococcal vaccination does not add points but might be considered protective. For congestive heart failure, it falls under the category of a chronic cardiac disease. Therefore, the patient gets +1 point for congestive heart failure. Step 3: Vital signs. - Temperature = 36.5 \u00b0C (normothermic; less than 36.0\u00b0C or greater than 39.9\u00b0C adds points) Since 36.5 \u00b0C is between 36.0 and 39.9\u00b0C, we assign 0 points for body temperature. - Pulse: 82 bpm. The criteria for pulse rate points: - Pulse rate less than 90 bpm gets 0 points. - Pulse rate 90\u2013100 bpm gets 1 point. - Pulse rate 101\u2013110 bpm gets 1 point. - Pulse rate exceeding 110 bpm gets 2 points. Since the pulse rate is 82 bpm, that\u2019s less than 90, so it gets 0 points. - Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute For respiratory rate, - Respiratory rate < 24/min gets 0 points. - Respiratory rate \u2265 24/min gets 1 point. Since the respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min, it\u2019s < 24, and thus gets 0 points. - Blood Pressure The systolic BP is 128 mm Hg. For systolic blood pressure, - Systolic BP > 130 mm Hg gets 0 points. - Systolic BP between 100\u2013130 mm Hg gets 1 point. - Systolic BP below 100 mm Hg gets 2 points. Since the systolic BP here is 128, it falls into the category of >100 and \u2264130 mm Hg, so it gets 1 point. Step 4: Laboratory results. Let\u2019s evaluate the lab results using the PSI criteria: 1. Hematocrit (Hct) - If hemoglobin is given, it could be converted to hematocrit (Hct), but here we have Hct directly at 39%. The criteria are: - Hct \u2265 39.1% gets 0 points. - Hct 33.1\u201339% gets 1 point. - Hct \u2264 33% gets 2 points. Since the patient has a hematocrit of 39%, it falls into the range just below 39.1%. According to the Pneumonia Severity Index classification for Hematocrit: if Hct = 39%, it falls into the 33.1\u201339% range, getting 1 point. 2. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) - BUN \u2264 19 mg/dL gets 0 points. - BUN > 19 mg/dL gets 1 point. Since the patient\u2019s BUN is 27 mg/dL (which is greater than 19 mg/dL), she gets +1 point for BUN. 3. PaO2 - PaO2/FiO2 ratio is important in the PSI. We need the FiO2 to calculate the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, but if the patient is breathing room air (FiO2 \u2248 21% or 0.21), the PaO2/FiO2 can be approximated. For simplicity, assuming the patient is on room air, FiO2 = 0.21. So PaO2/FiO2 = 80 / 0.21 \u2248 380.95. - However, directly evaluating PaO2 in the context of PSI criteria: - PaO2 > 65 mm Hg gets 0 points. - PaO2 \u2264 65 mm Hg gets 2 points. Since the given PaO2 is 80 mm Hg, which is > 65 mm Hg, it scores 0 points for PaO2. Now sum up all the points from the criteria: - Age: 4 points (for being aged between 75\u201384) - Comorbid conditions: +1 point (Congestive Heart Failure) - Vital Signs: - Temperature: 0 points - Pulse rate: 0 points - Respiratory rate: 0 points - Systolic BP: 1 point (since it\u2019s between 100\u2013130 mm Hg) - Laboratory results: - Hematocrit: 1 point (Hct = 39%, which falls within the 33.1\u201339% range) - BUN: 1 point (since it is greater than 19 mg/dL) - PaO2: 0 points (since PaO2 > 65 mmHg) Now add all of these points together: 4 (age) + 1 (comorbid condition) + 0 (temperature) + 0 (pulse) + 0 (respiratory rate) + 1 (systolic BP) + 1 (hematocrit) + 1 (BUN) + 0 (PaO2) = 8 points. Based on the scores obtained, a total score of 8 points corresponds to the PSI class. To map this to PSI classes: - 0\u20133: PSI class I, Low Risk - 4\u20137: PSI class II, Moderate Risk - 8\u201311: PSI class III, High Risk - 12\u201315: PSI class IV, Very High Risk - 16+: PSI class V, Extremely High Risk {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we will use the given information about the patient including age, comorbidities, vital signs, and lab values.\\n1. **Age Calculation:** The patient is 75 years old, which falls in the age group of 75-84, so she gets 4 points for age.\\n2. **Comorbid Conditions:** The patient has congestive heart failure.

Lab values:  \n   - Hematocrit = 39%.  \n   - Glucose = 180 mg/dL (elevated).  \n   - BUN = 27 mg/dL (slightly high).  \n   - Sodium = 139 mEq/L (within normal limits).  \n   - Arterial blood gas: pH = 7.40, PaO2 = 80 mmHg.  \n7. CXR shows indications of pleural effusion.  \n  \nNext, let\u2019s apply the PSI criteria to determine the points for each.  \nThe Pneumonia Severity Index uses multiple parameters:  \n- Demographics (age).  \n- Comorbid conditions.  \n- Vital signs.  \n- Lab results.  \n  \nLet\u2019s break this down step by step:  \n  \nStep 1: Age.  \nAge 75 years old.  \nFor ages:  \n- 40\u201344 years old get 0 points.  \n- 45\u201354 years old get 1 point.  \n- 55\u201364 years old get 2 points.  \n- 65\u201374 years get 3 points.  \n- 75\u201384 years get 4 points.  \n- Over 84 years get 5 points.  \nSince the patient is 75 years old, she belongs to the age group 75\u201384 years, so she gets 4 points for age.  \n  \nStep 2: Comorbid conditions.  \nThe patient has a history of congestive heart failure.  \nThe comorbid conditions that add points include:  \n- Chronic cardiac disease: 1 point.  \n- Chronic lung disease (such as COPD): 1 point.  \n- Liver disease: 1 point.  \n- Connective tissue/immunosuppression: 1 point.  \n- Renal failure (as determined by creatinine level): 1 point.  \n- Cerebrovascular disease or dementia: 1 point.  \n- Diabetes mellitus: 1 point.  \n- Previous influenza or pneumococcal vaccination does not add points but might be considered protective.  \nFor congestive heart failure, it falls under the category of a chronic cardiac disease. Therefore, the patient gets +1 point for congestive heart failure.  \n  \nStep 3: Vital signs.  \n- Temperature = 36.5 \u00b0C (normothermic; less than 36.0\u00b0C or greater than 39.9\u00b0C adds points)  \n  Since 36.5 \u00b0C is between 36.0 and 39.9\u00b0C, we assign 0 points for body temperature.  \n- Pulse: 82 bpm.  \n  The criteria for pulse rate points:  \n  - Pulse rate less than 90 bpm gets 0 points.  \n  - Pulse rate 90\u2013100 bpm gets 1 point.  \n  - Pulse rate 101\u2013110 bpm gets 1 point.  \n  - Pulse rate exceeding 110 bpm gets 2 points.  \n  Since the pulse rate is 82 bpm, that\u2019s less than 90, so it gets 0 points.  \n- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/minute  \n  For respiratory rate,  \n  - Respiratory rate < 24/min gets 0 points.  \n  - Respiratory rate \u2265 24/min gets 1 point.  \n  Since the respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min, it\u2019s < 24, and thus gets 0 points.  \n- Blood Pressure  \n  The systolic BP is 128 mm Hg.  \n  For systolic blood pressure,  \n  - Systolic BP > 130 mm Hg gets 0 points.  \n  - Systolic BP between 100\u2013130 mm Hg gets 1 point.  \n  - Systolic BP below 100 mm Hg gets 2 points.  \n  Since the systolic BP here is 128, it falls into the category of >100 and \u2264130 mm Hg, so it gets 1 point.  \n  \nStep 4: Laboratory results.  \nLet\u2019s evaluate the lab results using the PSI criteria:  \n1. Hematocrit (Hct)  \n   - If hemoglobin is given, it could be converted to hematocrit (Hct), but here we have Hct directly at 39%.  \n   The criteria are:  \n   - Hct \u2265 39.1% gets 0 points.  \n   - Hct 33.1\u201339% gets 1 point.  \n   - Hct \u2264 33% gets 2 points.  \n   Since the patient has a hematocrit of 39%, it falls into the range just below 39.1%. According to the Pneumonia Severity Index classification for Hematocrit: if Hct = 39%, it falls into the 33.1\u201339% range, getting 1 point.  \n2. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)  \n   - BUN \u2264 19 mg/dL gets 0 points.  \n   - BUN > 19 mg/dL gets 1 point.  \n   Since the patient\u2019s BUN is 27 mg/dL (which is greater than 19 mg/dL), she gets +1 point for BUN.  \n3. PaO2  \n   - PaO2/FiO2 ratio is important in the PSI. We need the FiO2 to calculate the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, but if the patient is breathing room air (FiO2 \u2248 21% or 0.21), the PaO2/FiO2 can be approximated. For simplicity, assuming the patient is on room air, FiO2 = 0.21. So PaO2/FiO2 = 80 / 0.21 \u2248 380.95.  \n   - However, directly evaluating PaO2 in the context of PSI criteria:  \n     - PaO2 > 65 mm Hg gets 0 points.  \n     - PaO2 \u2264 65 mm Hg gets 2 points.  \n   Since the given PaO2 is 80 mm Hg, which is > 65 mm Hg, it scores 0 points for PaO2.  \n  \nNow sum up all the points from the criteria:  \n- Age: 4 points (for being aged between 75\u201384)  \n- Comorbid conditions: +1 point (Congestive Heart Failure)  \n- Vital Signs:  \n  - Temperature: 0 points  \n  - Pulse rate: 0 points  \n  - Respiratory rate: 0 points  \n  - Systolic BP: 1 point (since it\u2019s between 100\u2013130 mm Hg)  \n- Laboratory results:  \n  - Hematocrit: 1 point (Hct = 39%, which falls within the 33.1\u201339% range)  \n  - BUN: 1 point (since it is greater than 19 mg/dL)  \n  - PaO2: 0 points (since PaO2 > 65 mmHg)  \n  \nNow add all of these points together: 4 (age) + 1 (comorbid condition) + 0 (temperature) + 0 (pulse) + 0 (respiratory rate) + 1 (systolic BP) + 1 (hematocrit) + 1 (BUN) + 0 (PaO2) = 8 points.  \n  \nBased on the scores obtained, a total score of 8 points corresponds to the PSI class. To map this to PSI classes:  \n- 0\u20133: PSI class I, Low Risk  \n- 4\u20137: PSI class II, Moderate Risk  \n- 8\u201311: PSI class III, High Risk  \n- 12\u201315: PSI class IV, Very High Risk  \n- 16+: PSI class V, Extremely High Risk  \n  \n{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we will use the given information about the patient including age, comorbidities, vital signs, and lab values.\\n1. **Age Calculation:** The patient is 75 years old, which falls in the age group of 75-84, so she gets 4 points for age.\\n2. **Comorbid Conditions:** The patient has congestive heart failure.

Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance.

We use admission creatinine: 10.48 mg/dL, peak creatinine: 13.6 mg/dL, the time period over which this occurs: 3 days, and albumin is 3.8 g/dL. The $\\Delta Creatinine is $3.12 \\, \\text{mg/dL},$ and using the formula: ACDR = $ \\Delta C \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{Time}} {\\text{Albumin}}\\right) = 3.12 * \\left(\\frac{3}{3.8}\\right), which simplifies to ACDR = 2.47 approximately.", "LLM Thinking": "First, I need to calculate the albumin-corrected delta ratio (ACDR). The albumin-corrected delta ratio is used as an indicator to assess the severity of acute kidney injury and is typically calculated using the formula: \\[ \\Delta Ratio = \\left(\\frac{C2 - C1}{C1}\\right) \\times T \\] where $C1$ is the initial creatinine, $C2$ is the peak creatinine, and $T$ is the time between the two measurements in days. However, the albumin-corrected delta ratio considers that the creatinine changes should be corrected for albumin levels because serum albumin is a marker for nutritional status and muscle mass which can influence creatinine levels. The formula for the ACDR is adjusted by correcting creatinine changes for the amount of serum albumin: \\[ \\text{Albumin-Corrected Delta Ratio (ACDR)} = \\left(\\frac{(C2 - C1)}{C1}\\right) \\times \\frac{T}{A}\\] However, it appears there is a bit of confusion since the term \"albumin-corrected delta ratio\" isn't frequently used in standard AKI evaluation settings. Instead, the usual term is delta-delta ratio, and the albumin correction is not typical for calculating this metric. If we're using the standard $\\Delta$ creatinine change and time since the problem doesn't specify an exact adjustment for albumin in the context of renal injury calculation. Given the information provided, the progression of creatinine is given as follows: - Initial creatinine (C1): 1.15 mg/dL from 3 years earlier. - The most recent creatinine level before the admission (pre-admission baseline creatinine isn't given directly, but we will use the last recorded value of baseline creatinine given as 1.15 mg/dL). - The creatinine at the time of hospital admission: 10.48 mg/dL - The peak creatinine during the admission: 13.6 mg/dL We'll calculate the rise in creatinine from the baseline (1.15 mg/dL) to the peak (13.6 mg/dL). If the time (T) between the baseline creatinine measurement (from 3 years prior) and the time to peak creatinine during this hospital stay isn\u2019t given precisely, it's challenging to use the traditional $\\Delta\\Delta$ ratio directly because the $T$ term would be a very large number (in years).

Using the formula for the delta ratio: \\[\\Delta Ratio = \\left(\\frac{C2 - C1}{C1}\\right) * T. \\] Here $C1= 10.48 \\, \\text{mg/dL},$ $C2 = 13.6 \\, \\text{mg/dL},$ and $T = 3 \\, \\text{days}. Let's calculate $\\frac{C2 - C1}{C1}$ first: \\[ \\frac{13.6 - 10.48}{10.48}.\\] Now, we'll also use the baseline creatinine from three years ago for a different approach.

Given the context and the data, it seems the task asked for an Albumin-corrected Delta ratio, but such a computation requires considering the albumin level for correction. The albumin level given is 3.8 g/dL. The formula for Albumin-Corrected Serum Creatinine (ACr) is generally expressed as: \\[ACr = \\frac{\\text{Serum Creatinine}}{\\text{Albumin}} * \\text{a constant}. \\] But let us simplify the approach and attempt to calculate the delta ratio and correct for albumin according to a given standard adjustment. If we use the formula \\[ACDR = \\Delta Creatinine * \\frac{T (time in days)}{\\text{Albumin}}.\\] Using the increase in the creatinine from admission to peak: $\\Delta Creatinine = 13.6-10.48 = 3.12\\text{ mg/dL},$ $T = 3 \\text{ days},$ and $\\text{Albumin}= 3.8 \\text{g/dL}.$ Calculate the albumin-corrected delta: \\[ ACDR = 3.12 * \\frac{3}{3.8}. \\]", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.25", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L.

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children\u2019s and Women\u2019s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/\u03bcL, platelet count of 61000/\u03bcL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb\u2019s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.\nOne year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.\nLiver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.\nDuring her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months.

{"Row Number": 142, "Calculator Name": "MDRD GFR Equation", "Calculator ID": "9", "Category": "lab", "Note ID": "pmc-4065736-1", "Patient Note": "A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.", "Question": "Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Name": "BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B", "LLM Answer": "1", "LLM Explanation": "Based on the high serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL and the clinical context (renal failure, anuria and requirement for hemodialysis), I calculated that the GFR using the MDRD formula will be very low.

However the most common MDRD simplified formula used for clinic settings is \\[ GFR = 175 \\times (\\text{Serum Creatinine}/e)^{-1.154}* 0.742^{(If Female)} *1.212^{(If African American)}.\\] To calculate the GFR using the MDRD equation for this 27-year-old African-American female, the serum creatinine is provided in the note: 14.6 mg/dL. Let's apply the MDRD equation: The factors we have are: - Serum Creatinine (SCr) = 14.6 mg/dL. - Patient's Age = 27 years - Sex = Female. - Race = African-American. MDRD equation: \\[ GFR = 175 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{SCr}}{e}\\right)^{-1.154} \\times 0.742 (\\text{(For Female)}) \\times 1.212 (\\text{(For African-American)}) \\] However, the creatinine should be converted to the metric units as the MDRD equation typically uses serum creatinine in \u00b5mol/L if the international formula is used. Convert 14.6 mg/dL to \u00b5mol/L. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 88.4 \u00b5mol/L. So, Serum Creatinine in \u00b5mol/L = $14.6 * 88.4 ~= 1292.64$ \u00b5mol/L Now, the original formula given in metric units is: $$GFR = \\frac {\\left({186 \\times (\\text{(min(}{Serum Creatinine, 1.5 \\ \\times (1.5 if female)}))^{-1.154} \\times 0.742^+(\\text{if female}) \\times 1.212^+(\\text{African American}) \\times 0.993^ \\text{(Age)} \\right)} {1.73 \\ m^2}}$$ But I'll use a hybrid approach using mg/dL directly in the equation which is common. The MDRD simplified equation in mg/dL for an African-American female is: \\[ GFR \\approx \\left(175 \\times \\left(\\frac {\\text{(SCr)}} {0.9}\\right)^ {-1.7} \\times 0.79 \\times 1.81 \\right), where 0.79 corresponds to the factor for females and 1.81 adjustes to 1.21 for the African American ethnicity. \\] But applying the given data to the MDRD equation will be tricky here. So let's use the commonly used form in US. Let's use the given MDRD equation for the US units: \\[ GFR = (175 \\times (\\text{(SCr in mg/dL)/e}{)}^{-1.7} \\times (2 if African American else 1) \\times (0.75 if female else 0.8)) / 1.73 \\] But for this specific instance, we'll use the formula for calculating a GFR using the MDRD directly with the creatinine values and apply the adjustments. Using the MDRD Equation where \\( \\log e GFR = \\beta0 + \\beta1 * \\log e SCR + \\beta_age * \\log e Age +...\\) but instead for a simpler practical equation used for the MDRD in the US is written as: \\[ GFR(mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175 * (\\frac{SCr}{e})^{-1.154} \\times 0.742 (if female) \\times 1.212 (if African American). \\] Let's input the values into this formula. First, let's Simplify $(\\text {(Serum Cr)} /g)^{-1.154}$ Calculate \\($\\frac{14.6}{e}$ But it doesn't seem to be common practice - so let correct this calculation. Let's use GFR Equation specific to Serum creatinine: For mg/dL: The simplified formula for male and female patients is: For females $ GFR_{MDRD} = 175 * ( (SCr / mg/dL)^{ -1.154 } ) times (0.742) *times Adjustments for African American.$ So $GFR = 175 x \\left(\\frac{1}{14.6}\\right) ^{-1.154}$ * 0.742 * 1.212 Let's Calculate $\\frac{1}{14.6}.$ Now $(0.0685)^{-1.154}$ Using calculator: $(0.0685)^{-1.154}\\approx 29.03.$ Then we multiply: $175 * 29.03 \\approx 5079.25,$ Now multiply the Female Adjustment of 0.742 $ 5079.25 * 0.742 = approximate to 3769.2$ Now apply the African-American adjustment of 1.212 $ 3769.2 * 1.212 \\approx 4565.1$ This calculation result looks very high for GFR given the condition It seems like the given serum creatinine value was very high (14.6 mg/dL), which indicates kidney dysfunction at a stage where GFR is probably low. Therefore let calculate using the MDRD simplified equation known to be used: \\[ eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 186 * \\left(\\frac{\\text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)}} {X} \\right)^{-1.154} * 0.79 (If Female) * 1.018^(Age) * 1.159 (if African-American) \\] Step 1: Calculate $(14.6)^{1.154}$ Using the calculator: $(14.6)^{1.154} \\approx 39.03$ Thus, $1/39.03 \\approx 0.0256$ Multiply: $186 * 0.0256 =186 * 0.0256 \\approx 4.75$ Then multiply with $0.742$: $4.75 * 0.742 \\approx 3.5235$ $3.5235 * 1.159 \\approx 4.08$ This calculation result aligns with severe kidney dysfunction given the patient's high serum creatinine.", "Ground Truth Answer": "3.654", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 27 years old.

A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear.

We'll use the Rautaharju correction formula for calculating the QTc. The Rautaharju formula to calculate the corrected QT (QTc) is: \\[ QTc = QT + 0.154 * (HR - 62). \\\\ First, we calculate HR - 62: \\[ HR - 62 = 79 - 62 = 17. \\] Next, we multiply 17 by 0.154 to get: \\[ 0.154 * 17 = 2.618.\\] Now, add this to the original QT interval of 330 msec.: \\[ QTc = 330 + 2.618 \u2248 332.618 msec.\\\\ Rounded to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 333 msec.", "LLM Thinking": "Let's approach this problem step by step. We have the heart rate, which is 79 bpm (beats per minute) and a QT interval measured as 330 msec. The Rautaharju formula for correcting the QT interval is given by: \\[QT_{c (Rautaharju)} = QT + 0.154 \u00d7 (HR - 62)\\] But this is not the standard term usually used for the Rautaharju formula. There seem to be some misunderstandings about the name and formula. A more commonly used formula to correct the QT interval for heart rate is Bazett's correction or Fridericia's correction, but let's assume the user might have been referring to a correction formula in general, possibly including the one that takes the form that modifies the QT interval based on the heart rate. However, the Rautaharju correction formula is actually defined differently. The Rautaharju formula to calculate the corrected QT (QTc) interval can be written as follows: \\[QT_{c (Rautaharju)} = QT + a * (HR - 62)\\] But without the explicit value of $a$, typically it is not the most widely used formula among clinicians. A more standard formula is Bazett's correction, Fridericia's correction, or the Fredericia formula. Since the problem might involve the Rautaharju method, let's use a commonly associated empirical approach or let's assume the formula being referred to is a standard correction. We will apply the formula typically referred to as the Bazett\u2019s Formula and the Fridericia correction to see which one applies here or find the required one. The Bazett's Formula is: \\[QT_c = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt{RR}}.\\] But let's first convert the heart rate (HR) to RR interval, as needed for Bazett's formula. Since the heart rate (HR) is 79 bpm: \\[ RR = \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{\\text{heart rate}} = \\frac{60}{79} \\approx 0.7595 \\text{ seconds.}\\] Convert this RR interval into milliseconds because QT is typically measured in milliseconds. Since 1 second = 1000 milliseconds, \\[ RR \\text{ in msec} = 0.7595 \\times 1000 \\approx 759.5 \\text{ msec}.\\] Now let's apply the Bazett's correction formula. The formula Bazett's correction is: \\[ QT_c = QT \\times \\frac{1000}{\\sqrt{RR}}.\\] We have the QT interval = 330 msec and $RR \\approx 759.5 \\text{ msec.}$ Plugging these values into Bazett's correction: \\[ QT_c = 330 \\times \\frac{1000}{\\sqrt{759.5}}.\\] First, calculate the square root of the RR interval: \\[ \\sqrt{759.5} \\approx 27.56 \\] Now use this value in the formula: \\[ QT_c = 330 \\times \\frac{1000}{27.56} \\approx 330 \\times 36.26.\\] Calculate $330 \\times 36.26$: \\[ 330 \\times 36.26 = 11965.8.\\] Since the Bazett\u2019s formula correction likely goes awry due to its limitations and over-corrects at higher and lower heart rates, and the result seems incorrect. Let's use the Fridericia's Correction to see if this gives a reasonable correction. The Fridericia correction formula is: \\[ QT_c = \\frac{QT}{(RR)^{1 / 3}},\\] where $QT$ is given in milliseconds and $RR$ also is in seconds.

The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.\nThe bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days).

So, Fever (temperature > 38\u00b0C) = 1 point. Step 2: Presence of Palatine tonsillar exudate. The note does not mention any palatine tonsillar exudate. So, we'll assume 0 points for this criterion since no information suggests the presence of tonsillar exudate. Step 3: Absence/presence of cervical adenopathy.

The phrase \"severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days,\" and \"the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts,\" indicates discomfort and likely malaise. We can interpret the severe pain and the impact it has on the patient's comfort as indicative of malaise. So, Increased Sensation of \"Being Sick\" = 1 point.

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7\u00b0F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m\u00b2. Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2. His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis.

The measured values provided are: serum sodium [Na+] = 137 mmol/L, serum chloride [Cl-] = 98 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate [HCO3-] = 9 mmol/L. Plugging these values into the formula gives: Anion Gap = 137 - (98 + 9). Therefore, Anion Gap = 137 - 107 = 30 mmol/L.\\nTo find the delta gap, we use the formula \u0394Gap = (Measured Anion Gap) - (Normal Anion Gap). The normal anion gap is typically about 8-16 mmol/L. Let's take the midpoint of the normal range as 12 mmol/L.\\nNow, we can calculate the delta gap:\\n\u0394Gap = 30 mmol/L - 12 mmol/L.\\nThus the Delta Gap = 18 mmol/L.", "LLM Thinking": "To find the patient's delta gap, we need to calculate the Anion Gap and compare it to the calculated GFR and other laboratory results. Let's approach this step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate the Anion Gap. The formula for the anion gap is given by: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3-]) Using the blood chemistry values from the patient note, we have: - Serum sodium (Na) = 137 mmol/L, - Serum potassium = 5.0 mmol/L (not needed for anion gap), - Serum chloride (Cl) = 98 mmol/L, - Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 9 mmol/L. Now, we can plug these values into the anion gap formula: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]) Step 2: Calculate the Delta Gap. The \u0394Gap (delta gap) is calculated using the formula: \u0394Gap = Anion Gap - (Normal GFR - Measured GFR).

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 = 77 / 0.54 \u2248 143 According to the Respiratory SOFA score: - 100 - 200: Score = 3 Therefore, Respiratory score = 3. 2. **Coagulation (based on platelet count):** Platelet count = 180,000/\u03bcL. Since the platelet count exceeds 150,000/\u03bcL, the score is 0. 3. **Liver (\u57fa\u4e8e bilirubin level):** Bilirubin = 1.7 mg/dL. Since bilirubin < 2 mg/dL, the score is 0. 4. **Cardiovascular (based on vasopressor support and blood pressure):** The patient is on multiple vasopressors \u2014 dopamine (4 mcg/kg/min), dobutamine (inotrope), norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min), and epinephrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min). Converting the doses to their approximate dopamine equivalents: - Dopamine: 4 mcg/kg/min - Norepinephrine: 0.07 mcg/kg/min \u2248 0.35 - 0.7 mcg/kg/min (dopamine equivalence, using 5-10 mcg/kg/min per 1 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine) - Epinephrine: 0.03 mcg/kg/min \u2248 0.45 - 0.6 mcg/kg/min dopamine equivalence (since epinephrine is more potent). Adding all doses together: Total = 4 + 0.35-0.7 + 0.45 - 0.6 \u2248 4.8 to maximum sum 5.3 mcg/kg/min Since the total adds up to be between 4.8-5.3 mcg/kg/min in dopamine equivalence, considering the use of multiple agents like norepinephrine and dobutamine, along with Epinephrine and dopamin, indicates significant support is needed. Given this situation, the cardiovascular score would likely be high, indicating significant support. From the Cardiovascular scoring parameters, given the use of multiple pressors and inotropes (dobutamine), combined with the norepinephrine and epinephrine, it suggests a significant cardiovascular disturbance indicating a score corresponding to high vasopressor requirements or higher. Therefore the score is likely around 2 to 3 for cardiovascular. I\u2019m going to assign the Cardiovascular score to be 3, given the combination of multiple vasopressors and inotropes. 5. **Renal (based on creatinine and urine output):** - Serum Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL. Looking at the serum creatinine scoring: 1.2 - 1.9 mg/dL corresponds to a score of 1. - Urine Output = 925 mL/day, which is over 200 mL/24 hr. Hence, the Urine output score is 0. Taking the maximum score between Creatinine and Urine output: So the total renal SOFA score = MAX(score for creatinine: 1, Score for urine output: 0) = 1. 6. **Neurology (based on the Glasgow Coma Score - GCS):** GCS = 13. According to the scoring: - GCS = 13, corresponds to a score of 2. Now sum up the scores from each component: Respiratory: 3, Coagulation: 0, Liver: 0, Cardiovascular: 3, Renal: 1, Neurology: 2. Adding these scores gives: 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9. Therefore the patient's total SOFA score is 9.", "LLM Thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate six different organ systems and their corresponding parameters. The six organ systems considered by the SOFA score are: respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, renal, and neurology (as measured by the GCS, Glasgow Coma Score). Let's break down the information from the given patient note and compute the SOFA score step-by-step for each system. **1. Respiratory:** SOFA Respiratory Score is based on the PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio or the need for mechanical ventilation. - PaO\u2082 = 77 mm Hg - FiO\u2082 = 54% The PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio can be calculated as: \\[ \\text{PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082} = \\left(\\frac{77}{0.54}\\right) \\approx 142.59 \\] The SOFA scoring for the respiratory system is based on the PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio or type of respiratory support: - PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 > 400: Score = 0 - 300 - 400: Score = 1 - 200 - 300: Score = 2 - 100 - 200: Score = 3 - PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 < 100 or mechanical ventilation with FiO\u2082 > 0.6 and PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 < 200: Score = 4 Since the patient is on CPAP with an FiO\u2082 of 0.54 and has a PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 ratio \u2248 143, we need to check which range it falls into: - PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 \u2248 143 falls between 100-200. **2. Hematology (Coagulation):** The SOFA score for coagulation is based on the Platelet count. - Platelet count = 180,000/\u00b5L The scoring is as follows: - Platelets > 150,000/\u00b5L: Score = 0 - 100,000 - 150,000/\u00b5L: Score = 1 - 50,000 - 100,000/\u00b5L: Score = 2 - 20,000 - 50,000/\u00b5L: Score = 3 - <20,000/\u00b5L: Score = 4 Since the Platelet count is 180,000/\u00b5L, which is greater than 150,000/\u00b5L: **3. Liver:** The SOFA score for the liver is based on the bilirubin level. - Bilirubin = 1.7 mg/dL The scoring is as follows: - Bilirubin < 2: Score = 0 - 2 - 6.9: Score = 1 - 7 - 11.9: Score = 2 - 12 - 19.9: Score = 3 - \u226520: Score = 4 Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, which is less than 2 mg/dL: **4. Cardiovascular:** The SOFA score for the cardiovascular system depends on blood pressure and vasopressor support. The patient has the following vasopressors: - Dopamine at 4 mcg/kg/min - Dobutamine at 3.5 mcg/kg/min - Norepinephrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min - Epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min To determine the Cardiovascular SOFA score, we need to evaluate if the patient requires vasopressors and/or inotropes and the dosage or type of these agents. The scoring is as follows: - No vasopressors and mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 70 mm Hg: Score = 0 - Vasopressors required to maintain MAP \u2265 65 mm Hg or norepinephrine/dopamine or equivalent \u2264 5 mcg/kg/min: Score = 1 - Norepinephrine or dopamine or equivalent > 5 to 15 mcg/kg/min: Score = 2 - Norepinephrine or dopamine or equivalent > 15 mcg/kg/min or any vasopressor plus inotrope: Score = 3 - Cardiac arrest requiring mechanical circulatory support: Score = 4 Let's analyze the information step by step: - The patient is using multiple vasopressors: dopamine 4 mcg/kg/min, dobutamine 3.5 mcg/kg/min, norepinephrine 0.07 mcg/kg/min, and epinephrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min. - We must combine these into their relative effective dosages. Dopamine (4 mcg/kg/min): - For the dosage of dopamine above 5 mcg/kg/min, the scoring shifts. Here it's 4 mcg/kg/min, so it is less than 15 mcg/kg/min. Norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min): Since norepinephrine and epinephrine are relatively potent, their doses need conversion to the approximate equivalence for the dopamine or norepinephrine scale: For norepinephrine, the given dosage is 0.07 mcg/kg/min. For epinephrine, the given dosage is 0.03 mcg/kg/min. The conversions typically used are: - Norepinephrine 1 mcg/kg/min \u2248 Dopamine 5-10 mcg/kg/min. So, 0.07 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine is roughly 0.35 - 0.7 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. - Epinephrine 1 mcg/kg/min \u2248 Norepinephrine 3-4 mcg/kg/min \u2248 Dopamine 15-20 mcg/kg/min. So, 0.03 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine would be approximately equivalent to 0.09-0.12 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine, which would be roughly 0.45-0.6 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. Adding up all the vasopressor equivalents (in the scale of dopamine): - Dopamine directly: 4 mcg/kg/min - Norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) \u2248 0.35 - 0.7 mcg/kg-min of dopamine - Epinephrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min) \u2248 0.45-0.6 mcg/kg/min of dopamine Adding these effects together: \\[ 4 \\text{ mcg/kg/min (Dopamine)} + 0.35 - 0.7 \\text{ mcg/kg/min (from Norepinephrine)} + 0.45 - 0.6 \\text{ mcg/kg/min (from Epinephrine)}. \\] Let's take the minimum and maximum of this sum for a range: Minimum sum: \\[ 4 + 0.35 + 0.45 = 4.8. \\] Maximum sum: \\[ 4 + 0.7 + 0.6 = 5.3. \\] So, the total effective dose is somewhere between 4.8 to 5.3 mcg/kg/min in dopamine equivalence. Since this is slightly more than 5 mcg/kg/min, the patient's dosage falls in the range that requires the score for vasopressor use above 5 mcg/kg/min of equivalence. Based on the vasopressor usage: If the vasopressors used are within 5 to 15 mcg/kg/min (in norepinephrine/dopamine equivalence), the Cardiovascular SOFA score would be 2. Since the total effective dose is between approximately 4.8-5.3 mcg/kg/min in dopamine equivalence, this would typically correspond to the SOFA score for the combination falling between the use of vasopressors. But given the multiple agents being used and their combined effect, it suggests the patient requires more significant support. If we simplify the score based on the highest contribution from the norepinephrine and epinephrine: NorE+ Dop+ Epi: Since the use of both norepinephrine and epinephrine alongside dobutamine and dopamine indicates a significant need for inotropic support as well as vasoactive support, the use of multiple vasopressors and inotropes puts it into a higher SOFA category. For the purpose of this score, using the presence of both vasopressors and inotropes suggests a moderate to high level of cardiovascular support. **5. Renal:** The SOFA score for the renal system is based on the serum creatinine and urine output. - Serum Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - Urine Output = 925 mL/day Let's evaluate each component. **For Serum Creatinine:** The scoring is as follows: - Creatinine < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2 - 1.9: Score = 1 - 2 - 3.4: Score = 2 - 3.5 - 4.9: Score = 3 - \u2265 5: Score = 4 Since the serum creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 1.2 - 1.9. **For Urine Output:** The scoring is based on urine output: - Urine output > 200 mL in the last 24 hours: Score = 0 - Urine output < 200 mL/24hr or renal replacement therapy: Score = 2 or higher, depending on the duration of acute renal failure and urine output; for simplicity we'll use urine output alone here since no mention of renal replacement therapy. Since the urine output for the patient is documented at 925 mL/day (which is greater than 200 mL/24hrs), To get the final Renal SOFA score, we take the highest score between Serum Creatinine and Urine output. So, the Renal SOFA score is the maximum between 1 (serum creatinine) and 0 (urine output). **6. Neurology (Glasgow Coma Score - GCS):** The SOFA score for neurology is based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). - GCS = 13 The scoring is as follows: - GCS = 15: Score = 0 - 14: Score = 1 - 13: Score = 2 - 12: Score = 3 - GCS < 12: Score = 4 Since the patient's GCS is 13,", "Ground Truth Answer": "4", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's current SOFA score is 0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 77.0 mm Hg and FiO\u2082 percentage is 54.0 %. This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is 1.426. Whether the patient is on mechanical ventillation is not reported and so we assume this to be false. The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. For two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 13 and 14, we add 1 point to the score, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, make the current score 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 180000.0 count/\u00b5L. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10\u00b3/\u00b5L, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 4.\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 4 points.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate six different organ systems and their corresponding parameters.  \nThe six organ systems considered by the SOFA score are: respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, renal, and neurology (as measured by the GCS, Glasgow Coma Score).  \nLet's break down the information from the given patient note and compute the SOFA score step-by-step for each system.  \n\n**1.

Renal:**  \nThe SOFA score for the renal system is based on the serum creatinine and urine output.  \n- Serum Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL  \n- Urine Output = 925 mL/day  \nLet's evaluate each component.  \n\n**For Serum Creatinine:**  \nThe scoring is as follows:  \n- Creatinine < 1.2: Score = 0  \n- 1.2 - 1.9: Score = 1  \n- 2 - 3.4: Score = 2  \n- 3.5 - 4.9: Score = 3  \n- \u2265 5: Score = 4  \nSince the serum creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 1.2 - 1.9.  \n\n**For Urine Output:**  \nThe scoring is based on urine output:  \n- Urine output > 200 mL in the last 24 hours: Score = 0  \n- Urine output < 200 mL/24hr or renal replacement therapy: Score = 2 or higher, depending on the duration of acute renal failure and urine output; for simplicity we'll use urine output alone here since no mention of renal replacement therapy.  \nSince the urine output for the patient is documented at 925 mL/day (which is greater than 200 mL/24hrs),  \nTo get the final Renal SOFA score, we take the highest score between Serum Creatinine and Urine output.  \nSo, the Renal SOFA score is the maximum between 1 (serum creatinine) and 0 (urine output).  \n\n**6. Neurology (Glasgow Coma Score - GCS):**  \nThe SOFA score for neurology is based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS).  \n- GCS = 13  \nThe scoring is as follows:  \n- GCS = 15: Score = 0  \n- 14: Score = 1  \n- 13: Score = 2  \n- 12: Score = 3  \n- GCS < 12: Score = 4  \nSince the patient's GCS is 13,"}

However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics\u2014diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration\u2014are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection.

The patient\u2019s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient\u2019s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17\u20131.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5\u20136.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient\u2019s mental status gradually and steadily improved.

Adding Age points (3) and Chronic Health points (2): 10 + 3 + 2 = 15.", "LLM Thinking": "Let's approach this step-by-step to calculate the patient's APACHE II score. 1. **Identify the components of the APACHE II score:** The APACHE II score includes parameters such as age, chronic health conditions, and various physiologic measurements at the time of admission. The APACHE II score is calculated using the formula: APACHE II score = Age points + APACHE severity points from acute physiology + Chronic health points The acute physiology component includes: - GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) - Temperature - Heart rate - Systolic blood pressure - Respiratory rate / A-a gradient - PaO2/FiO2 - PH - Sodium - Potassium - Creatinine - WBC (white blood cell count) We'll go through each of these parameters and assign the appropriate points according to the APACHE II scoring guidelines. **Step 1: Age** The patient is 73 years old. According to the age points in APACHE II: - 71-80 years = 3 points **Step 2: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)** The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, indicating full consciousness. According to the GCS scoring in APACHE II: - GCS 15 = 1 point **Step 3: Temperature** The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2\u00b0C. According to the temperature range in the APACHE II criteria: - Temperature 34.0 - 38.9\u00b0C = 0 points. **Step 4: Heart Rate** The patient's heart rate is 107 beats per minute. According to the heart rate points in APACHE II: - 100-129 bpm = 1 point - >= 110 bpm and < 130 bpm falls into this category. **Step 5: Systolic Blood Pressure** The patient's blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, so the systolic blood pressure is 138 mmHg. According to the systolic blood pressure points: - 100 mmHg to 139 mmHg = 0 points. **Step 6: Respiratory rate or Arterial-alveolar gradient (A-a gradient)** The patient has a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute. However, since an A-a gradient is also given, we will use the A-a gradient as it is often used when calculating the APACHE II score for respiratory parameters. According to the given data, the A-a gradient is 331 mmHg. For the A-a gradient: The values provided are: A-a Gradient > 999 mmHg = 8 points. But the A-a gradient here is 331 mmHg, so we need to find the appropriate range from the APACHE II scoring system for A-a gradient: - 200-399 mmHg = 2 points - 400 - 599 mmHg = 3 points - > 600 mmHg = 4 points It seems there was an error in considering A-a gradient or respiratory rate directly. Let's calculate based on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio since the ABG results and FiO2 are provided. Given: PaO2 = 78 mm Hg FiO2 = 0.63 (assuming 63% inspired oxygen). Now calculate the PaO2/FiO2 ratio: PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 \u2248 123.81 Now we will use the PaO2/FiO2 value to determine the respiratory component's score. According to the APACHE II scoring for the PaO2/FiO2 ratio: - PaO2/FIO2 <= 100: 5 points - 100 < PaO2/FIO2 <= 200: 4 points - 200 < PaO2/FIO2 <= 300: 3 points - 300 < PaO2/FIO2 <= 400: 2 points - 400 < PaO2/FIO2 <= 500: 1 point - PaO2/FIO2 > 500: 0 points **Step 7: pH level** The patient has an arterial blood gas analysis that reveals a pH of 7.29. According to the pH ranges in APACHE II: - 7.45 <= pH <= 7.49 = 0 points - 7.25 to < 7.3 = 1 point - pH < 7.25 or > 7.49 = 2 points - 7.3 to < 7.45 = 0 points **Step 8: Sodium level** The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. According to the sodium level ranges in APACHE II: - 135-155 mmol/L = 0 points **Step 9: Potassium level** The potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. According to the potassium level ranges in APACHE II: - 3.5 - 5.4 mmol/L = 0 points. **Step 10: Creatinine level** The creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. According to the creatinine ranges: - creatinine ranges for the APACHE score: - 0.5 - 1.9 mg/dL = 0 points - 2.0 - 3.4 mg/dL = 1 point - 3.5 - 4.9 mg/dL = 2 points - 5.0 - 6.9 mg/dL = 3 points - >= 7.0 mg/dL = 4 points. **Step 11: White Blood Cell (WBC) Count** The WBC count is 15,105 cells/\u00b5L or typically given in *10^3* cells/\u00b5L. If we convert this to the standard WBC unit typically used (often expressed per mm3): WBC = 15,105. So it is 15,105 cells/mm3. According to the WBC ranges in the APACHE II score: - WBC < 1.0 x 10^3: 3 points - WBC 1.0 - < 4.0 x 10^3: 1 point - WBC 4.0 - < 12.0 x 10^3: 0 points - WBC 12.0 - < 18.0 x 10^3: 1 point - WBC >= 18.0 x 10^3: 2 points Now, let's sum up the physiology points. Finally, we need to add the Chronic Health points: The patient has a known history of liver cirrhosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. In the APACHE II scoring system, we add one point for each significant chronic condition that is listed. Chronic conditions considered under APACHE II include: - Liver disease (cirrhosis) - Cardiovascular disease (e.g., ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease) - Pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma, etc.) - Hematologic disease (leukemia, lymphoma, etc.) - Immunocompromised state (HIV, recent chemotherapy, etc.) - Renal failure - Diabetes - Malignancy From the patient's noted history: 1. Hypertension (counted as part of cardiovascular disease) 2. Type 2 Diabetes 3. Liver cirrhosis For each of these chronic conditions, the APACHE II assigns 1 point for each. Let's count the chronic health points: - Liver cirrhosis = 1 point - Hypertension = not typically assigned a separate point in APACHE II unless associated with specific complications such as congestive heart failure or renal disease. - Type 2 Diabetes = 1 point (if it is complicating the current condition such as requiring insulin--which suggests the diabetes is in an active state that contributes to severity). Since the patient is taking insulin for type 2 diabetes, it meets the criteria for consideration here. Thus, we have: - 1 point for liver cirrhosis - 1 point for type 2 diabetes requiring insulin", "Ground Truth Answer": "41", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 73.0 years old. The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative . Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 92.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 138.0 mm Hg = 107.333 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 107.333 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 35 and 49 breaths per minute, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 11 + 3 = 14.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 14 + 8 = 22.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 22. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 22 + 4 = 26.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 26 = 41.0. Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 41.0.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "Let's approach this step-by-step to calculate the patient's APACHE II score.  \n1. **Identify the components of the APACHE II score:** The APACHE II score includes parameters such as age, chronic health conditions, and various physiologic measurements at the time of admission.  \nThe APACHE II score is calculated using the formula: APACHE II score = Age points + APACHE severity points from acute physiology + Chronic health points  \nThe acute physiology component includes:  \n- GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale)  \n- Temperature  \n- Heart rate  \n- Systolic blood pressure  \n- Respiratory rate / A-a gradient  \n- PaO2/FiO2  \n- PH  \n- Sodium  \n- Potassium  \n- Creatinine  \n- WBC (white blood cell count)  \nWe'll go through each of these parameters and assign the appropriate points according to the APACHE II scoring guidelines.  \n\n**Step 1: Age**  \nThe patient is 73 years old.  \nAccording to the age points in APACHE II:  \n- 71-80 years = 3 points  \n\n**Step 2: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**  \nThe patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, indicating full consciousness.  \nAccording to the GCS scoring in APACHE II:  \n- GCS 15 = 1 point  \n\n**Step 3: Temperature**  \nThe patient is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2\u00b0C.  \nAccording to the temperature range in the APACHE II criteria:  \n- Temperature 34.0 - 38.9\u00b0C = 0 points.  \n\n**Step 4: Heart Rate**  \nThe patient's heart rate is 107 beats per minute.  \nAccording to the heart rate points in APACHE II:  \n- 100-129 bpm = 1 point  \n- >= 110 bpm and < 130 bpm falls into this category.  \n\n**Step 5: Systolic Blood Pressure**  \nThe patient's blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, so the systolic blood pressure is 138 mmHg.  \nAccording to the systolic blood pressure points:  \n- 100 mmHg to 139 mmHg = 0 points.  \n\n**Step 6: Respiratory rate or Arterial-alveolar gradient (A-a gradient)**  \nThe patient has a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute.  \nHowever, since an A-a gradient is also given, we will use the A-a gradient as it is often used when calculating the APACHE II score for respiratory parameters.  \nAccording to the given data, the A-a gradient is 331 mmHg.  \nFor the A-a gradient:  \nThe values provided are: A-a Gradient > 999 mmHg = 8 points.

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol. To convert 40.2 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin.

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5\u2103. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm\u00d72.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of \u03b22-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

No confusion.\\n- **Urea (U):** BUN is provided as 21 mg/dL. To convert to urea: Urea \u2248 BUN / 2.4. Therefore, Urea \u2248 21 / 2.4 \u2248 8.75 mg/dL. In mmol/L, this would be approximately 8.75 * 0.357 \u2248 3.12 mmol/L if using the BUN-to-urea weight relationship. I made a mistake; let's use a different approach. The provided BUN is 21 mg/dL and typically BUN and urea are related by: 1 mg/dL urea = BUN / 2.14. For simplicity, and sometimes the U is taken directly as BUN if the lab reports it in this way For the CURB-65 score, if urea is considered as BUN > 20 mg/dL, it corresponds to almost 21 mg/dL which meets the threshold for urea. BUN 21 mg/dL does meet the threshold since BUN > 20 mg/dL meets the criterion.\\nSo Yes, the urea/BUN meets the criterion.\\n- **Respiratory rate (R):** The respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. Since it is < 30 breaths, this criterion is not met. No.\\n- **Blood pressure (B):** The blood pressure is 121/79, hence neither systolic (121 mm Hg > 90) nor diastolic (79 mm Hg > 60) meets the blood pressure criterion.

Step 1: Understand the CURB-65 criteria for assessing the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The criteria include: - C: Confusion (mental status change) - U: Urea > 7 mmol/L (> 20 mg/dL) - R: Respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths per minute - B: Blood pressure systolic \u2264 90 mm Hg or diastolic \u2264 60 mm Hg - 65+: Age \u2265 65 years Step 2: We'll review the patient's information and see if they meet any of these criteria. Let's check each component of the CURB-65 score based on the provided patient note. - **Confusion (C):** The note does not explicitly mention confusion or change in mental status for this patient. The patient has anorexia, malaise, nausea without vomiting, fever, and generalized weakness. There's nothing suggesting mental confusion. - **Urea (U):** The note provides the BUN (blood urea nitrogen), which is 21 mg/dL. To convert this to urea concentration, we use the approximate conversion factor: Urea (mg/dL) \u2248 BUN / 2.4. So, Urea \u2248 21 / 2.4 \u2248 8.75 mg/dL, which is approximately 3.2 mmol/L (since 1 mg/dL = 0.357 mmol/L). However, the threshold for the CURB-65 score is urea > 7 mmol/L (which corresponds to a BUN above around 21 mg/dL because BUN > 21 mg/dL would translate to urea > 7 mmol/L). Given the BUN is 21 mg/dL, it meets the borderline criterion, but technically it is exactly on the cutoff point for urea when converted. To be conservative in scoring for CURB-65, if the BUN is 21 mg/dL, this translates to urea \u2248 7.3 mmol/L which is just above 7mmol/L. So we can say the urea criterion is met because 21 mg/dL meets the BUN threshold for the equivalent urea concentration. - **Respiratory rate (R):** The respiratory rate (RR) is given as 19 breaths per minute. Since the respiratory rate is < 30 breaths per minute, this criterion is not met. - **Blood pressure (B):** The blood pressure (BP) is given as 121/79 mmHg. Therefore, the systolic BP is 121 mmHg (which is > 90 mmHg) and the diastolic BP is 79 mmHg (which is > 60 mmHg). This criterion is not met since neither the systolic nor diastolic blood pressure falls below the thresholds set by CURB-65. - **Age (65+):** The patient is 41 years old. Since the patient is not aged \u2265 65 years, this criterion is not met. Now let's count how many of the above criteria are met: - Confusion (C): No - Urea > 7 mmol/L corresponding to BUN > 21 mg/dL: Yes - Respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths per minute: No - Blood pressure systolic \u2264 90 or diastolic \u2264 60: No - Age 65+: No", "Ground Truth Answer": "1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points.\nThe patient is 41.0 years old.

The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 121 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 79 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg.

The patient has anorexia, malaise, nausea without vomiting, fever, and generalized weakness. There's nothing suggesting mental confusion.  \n- **Urea (U):** The note provides the BUN (blood urea nitrogen), which is 21 mg/dL. To convert this to urea concentration, we use the approximate conversion factor: Urea (mg/dL) \u2248 BUN / 2.4. So, Urea \u2248 21 / 2.4 \u2248 8.75 mg/dL, which is approximately 3.2 mmol/L (since 1 mg/dL = 0.357 mmol/L). However, the threshold for the CURB-65 score is urea > 7 mmol/L (which corresponds to a BUN above around 21 mg/dL because BUN > 21 mg/dL would translate to urea > 7 mmol/L). Given the BUN is 21 mg/dL, it meets the borderline criterion, but technically it is exactly on the cutoff point for urea when converted. To be conservative in scoring for CURB-65, if the BUN is 21 mg/dL, this translates to urea \u2248 7.3 mmol/L which is just above 7mmol/L. So we can say the urea criterion is met because 21 mg/dL meets the BUN threshold for the equivalent urea concentration.  \n- **Respiratory rate (R):** The respiratory rate (RR) is given as 19 breaths per minute. Since the respiratory rate is < 30 breaths per minute, this criterion is not met.  \n- **Blood pressure (B):** The blood pressure (BP) is given as 121/79 mmHg. Therefore, the systolic BP is 121 mmHg (which is > 90 mmHg) and the diastolic BP is 79 mmHg (which is > 60 mmHg). This criterion is not met since neither the systolic nor diastolic blood pressure falls below the thresholds set by CURB-65.  \n- **Age (65+):** The patient is 41 years old. Since the patient is not aged \u2265 65 years, this criterion is not met.  \n\nNow let's count how many of the above criteria are met:  \n- Confusion (C): No  \n- Urea > 7 mmol/L corresponding to BUN > 21 mg/dL: Yes  \n- Respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths per minute: No  \n- Blood pressure systolic \u2264 90 or diastolic \u2264 60: No  \n- Age 65+: No"}

Step 1: We'll convert each medication to its equivalent MME. For HYDROmorphone: The conversion factor for HYDROmorphone to MME is 4. That means every 1 mg of HYDROmorphone is equivalent to 4 mg of Morphine. The patient takes 10 mg of HYDROmorphone 1 time a day. For FentANYL patches: The conversion factors for Fentanyl doses to MME are as follows: 1 mcg/hour patch delivers a certain amount of Fentanyl over 72 hours. However, the patient dose is given as 40 mg of Fentanyl patch, which seems to be incorrect because Fentanyl patches are typically given in terms of mcg (micrograms) and not milligrams. A typical Fentanyl patch dose might be a 25 mcg/hour patch, a 50 mcg/hour patch etc., and the dose listed (40 mg) likely means 40 mcg/hour or some other misunderstood unit, but typically Fentanyl patches come in standard strengths such as 25 mcg/hour, 50 mcg/hour, 75 mcg/hour, 100 mcg/hour. From standard information: Each standard Fentanyl patch releases its dose over 72 hours. The daily MME for Fentanyl can be calculated using the following equivalences: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is roughly equivalent to 9 mg/day of MME. Since the patient note says '40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day,' it seems unusual. Let\u2019s assume it means the Fentanyl patch is in terms of mcg (a common unit for these patches): If we take 40 mcg/hour as the strength of the patch. To calculate the daily dosage in MME for Fentanyl: First, calculate the total dose per patch per day if a 40 mcg/hour patch is applied. If 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = approximately 0.25 mg/day of MME, then there's also a direct table often used for patches. Let's use the approximation based on the equivalent strengths for MME conversion: For Fentanyl patches, the table is often used where: - a 25 mcg/hour patch = approximately 18-22.5 mg MME/day. - a 50 mcg/hour patch = approximately 36 - 45 mg MME/day. And, typically, the conversion is 12-16 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is equivalent to 1 mg of Morphine every 4 hours. However given that it says \"40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day,\u201d it suggests there may be a mix-up of units. Let's consider the following: Let's assume it means 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patches applied 3 times in a 72 hour cycle (which is not standard but we need to take some assumptions since the units are inconsistent.) If one Fentanyl patch delivers 40 mcg per hour, it will deliver: \\(40 \\mcg/hour \\times 72 hours = 2880 \\mcg \\over course of 72 hours (3 days) \\). So the Fentanyl supplied per day from one patch will be: \\( \\frac{2880 \\mcg}{3 days} = 960 mcg/day \\). Now, converting this to MME: Typically 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approx. 9 mg MME/day. But since our patient applies this patch 3 times a day, it implies an incorrect frequency. Let's assume it means three different patches throughout the day that sum up to the total dose. Now, let's use another approach assuming that the 'times a day' portion is possibly incorrect and instead, look at the total daily dose: Using MME conversion: 1 mg Fentanyl (not typically the right unit for patches) to MME. 1 mcg/hour Fentanyl is roughly 9 mg Morphine/day. If the patient applies this patch 3 times a day (overlapping doses?), We need to reconsider the assumption since it doesn\u2019t sum up correctly to a real-world application. Let's assume instead a misunderstanding, and it means that the patient uses multiple patches daily or the patch regimen is not standard. Step 2: For Tramadol: The conversion factor for Tramadol to MME is approximately 0.1. That means every 1 mg of Tramadol is equivalent to 0.1 mg of Morphine. Let's sum up the given options for a potential answer. To simplify - We will calculate Hydrocodone (10 mg ) and Tramadol separately and assume the Patch dose is based on a common understanding. It is still high. Let's use real-world assumptions. If the patient has incorrect info and the patient takes multiple smaller doses equivalent to an average mcg. Let's re-calculate the simplest possible case by assuming typo in Fentanyl information.

Adding the mme/day of HYDROmorphone to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 50 = 50 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of FentANYL patch is 40 mg. The patient takes 3 doses/day of FentANYL patch.

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared ().

The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L).

Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in .

The standard formula to calculate serum osmolality is: Serum Osmolality \u2248 2 \u00d7 [Na+] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8 We need the following values: - Sodium concentration ([Na+]) - Glucose level - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level From the admission laboratory test data, we have the following: - Corrected Sodium = 133 mmol/L - Glucose = 569 mg/dL - BUN = 25.9 mg/dL Now, let's plug these values into the formula: First, calculate the contribution of sodium to serum osmolality: [Na+]: 133 mmol/L 2 \u00d7 [Na+] = 2 \u00d7 133 = 266 mOsm/kg Next, let's calculate the contribution of glucose to serum osmolality: Glucose = 569 mg/dL. To convert glucose to its contribution to serum osmolality, use the term [Glucose]/18. The conversion factor 18 comes from the molecular weight of glucose divided by 10, which is approximately 180/10.

[BUN/2.8] = 25.9 / 2.8 \u2248 9.25 mOsm/kg Now, add all the components together: Serum Osmolality \u2248 2 \u00d7 [Na+] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8 = 266 + 31.61 + 9.25 = approximately 306.86 mOsm/kg To ensure we're providing the correct calculation for this patient's osmolality based on other possible values if given any changes or other data: Let me check the values provided later for sodium as well since corrections might have been done later.

Specifically, if a full 25-day cycle ends 3 days earlier than the standard 28-day cycle, it implies that conceiving occurs correspondingly 3 days earlier within that cycle.\\n\\nThus to adjust for this, we subtract 3 days from the due date calculated for the standard cycle.\\nSo, subtract 3 days from January 16, 2022: \\nJanuary 16, 2022 - 3 days = January 13, 2022.\\n\\nThus the adjusted estimated due date is January 13, 2022.", "LLM Thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we typically start from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), add 7 days to this date if the standard 28-day cycle is assumed, and then add 9 months. However, since the patient has a 25-day cycle, we need to adjust slightly. Step 1: Start from the LMP given, which is April 9, 2021 (04/09/2021). Since the cycle length is 25 days instead of the standard 28 days, we need to find the ovulation date based on this cycle length and then calculate the estimated conception date. Ovulation typically occurs around mid-cycle. For a 25-day cycle, ovulation would occur roughly around: 25 days / 2 = 12.5 \\days from the first day of the LMP. This means ovulation occurred approximately on: April 9 (start of LMP) + 12 days = April 21. Since ovulation happens around the 12th or 13th day of the cycle for the next few days, we assume fertilization around that time as well. Pregnancy is calculated based on 266 days from conception (or roughly 38 weeks from conception to delivery). However, for simplicity and using Naegele's Rule with adjustment for cycle length differences, here\u2019s how we can proceed with the standard formula but adjust the LMP to account for the cycle difference. Naegele's Rule is: Due Date = (LMP + 280 days) For a standard 28-day cycle, Naegele's Rule involves adding 9 months and 7 days to the LMP. But for a cycle that is not standard (such as 25 days), we can use an adjusted approach where we find the expected conception date and adjust accordingly. The conception or fertilization would be approximately 12-16 days after the LMP if we assume ovulation around the 12th-14th day of a typical 25-day cycle. Let's use a simplified approach by accounting for the cycle difference and using a basic adjustment method. Step 2: First, calculate the due date assuming a 28-day cycle and then adjust for the cycle length. If the last menstrual period was April 9, 2021, applying Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle: Step 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP: Apr 9 + 7 days = Apr 16, 2021. Step 2: Now add 9 months to Apr 16, 2021: Adding 9 months to April 16 means moving to the same day in the 9th month forward. Apr + 9 months = Jan (of the following year). So, Apr 16, 2021 + 9 months = January 16, 2022 Now, we need to account for the difference from a 28-day cycle to a 25-day cycle. Since the given cycle length is 25 days, it is 3 days shorter than the standard 28-day cycle. Because the cycle is shorter by 3 days, the pregnancy length based on the LMP would also need to be adjusted by this differential. To calculate the adjusted due date: The cycle is 3 days shorter, so the conception date occurs 3 days earlier than it would in a standard 28-day cycle. Let's calculate the number of days of pregnancy for our 25-day cycle. 1. The standard rule assumes a 280-day pregnancy starting from LMP. 2. However, because her cycle is shorter by 3 days, her ovulation is earlier by those 3 days within the cycle. Since ovulation occurs approximately 12.5 days from the start of the LMP for a 25-day cycle compared to approximately 14 days within a 28-day cycle. The difference in the day of ovulation is: 14 - 12.5 = 1.5 days. So ovulation occurs about 1.5 days earlier than it would in a standard 28-day cycle. Thus the conception might be considered about 1.5 to 2 days earlier. Adding these to the pregnancy time from conception would affect the due date. To adjust the due date: Since a shorter cycle means she achieves ovulation earlier within the month, her pregnancy duration should effectively start from an earlier point within her cycle. We need to subtract approximately this difference from the due date calculated by the standard 28-day cycle.

", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we typically start from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), add 7 days to this date if the standard 28-day cycle is assumed, and then add 9 months.  \nHowever, since the patient has a 25-day cycle, we need to adjust slightly.  \nStep 1: Start from the LMP given, which is April 9, 2021 (04/09/2021).  \nSince the cycle length is 25 days instead of the standard 28 days, we need to find the ovulation date based on this cycle length and then calculate the estimated conception date.  \nOvulation typically occurs around mid-cycle.  \nFor a 25-day cycle, ovulation would occur roughly around: 25 days / 2 = 12.5 \\days from the first day of the LMP.  \nThis means ovulation occurred approximately on: April 9 (start of LMP) + 12 days = April 21.  \nSince ovulation happens around the 12th or 13th day of the cycle for the next few days, we assume fertilization around that time as well.  \nPregnancy is calculated based on 266 days from conception (or roughly 38 weeks from conception to delivery).  \nHowever, for simplicity and using Naegele's Rule with adjustment for cycle length differences, here\u2019s how we can proceed with the standard formula but adjust the LMP to account for the cycle difference.  \nNaegele's Rule is: Due Date = (LMP + 280 days)  \nFor a standard 28-day cycle, Naegele's Rule involves adding 9 months and 7 days to the LMP.  \nBut for a cycle that is not standard (such as 25 days), we can use an adjusted approach where we find the expected conception date and adjust accordingly.  \nThe conception or fertilization would be approximately 12-16 days after the LMP if we assume ovulation around the 12th-14th day of a typical 25-day cycle.  \nLet's use a simplified approach by accounting for the cycle difference and using a basic adjustment method.  \nStep 2: First, calculate the due date assuming a 28-day cycle and then adjust for the cycle length.  \nIf the last menstrual period was April 9, 2021, applying Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle:  \nStep 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP: Apr 9 + 7 days = Apr 16, 2021.  \nStep 2: Now add 9 months to Apr 16, 2021: Adding 9 months to April 16 means moving to the same day in the 9th month forward.  \nApr + 9 months = Jan (of the following year).  \nSo, Apr 16, 2021 + 9 months = January 16, 2022  \nNow, we need to account for the difference from a 28-day cycle to a 25-day cycle.  \nSince the given cycle length is 25 days, it is 3 days shorter than the standard 28-day cycle.  \nBecause the cycle is shorter by 3 days, the pregnancy length based on the LMP would also need to be adjusted by this differential.  \nTo calculate the adjusted due date:  \nThe cycle is 3 days shorter, so the conception date occurs 3 days earlier than it would in a standard 28-day cycle.  \nLet's calculate the number of days of pregnancy for our 25-day cycle.  \n1. The standard rule assumes a 280-day pregnancy starting from LMP.  \n2. However, because her cycle is shorter by 3 days, her ovulation is earlier by those 3 days within the cycle.  \nSince ovulation occurs approximately 12.5 days from the start of the LMP for a 25-day cycle compared to approximately 14 days within a 28-day cycle.  \nThe difference in the day of ovulation is: 14 - 12.5 = 1.5 days.  \nSo ovulation occurs about 1.5 days earlier than it would in a standard 28-day cycle.  \nThus the conception might be considered about 1.5 to 2 days earlier.  \nAdding these to the pregnancy time from conception would affect the due date.  \nTo adjust the due date: Since a shorter cycle means she achieves ovulation earlier within the month, her pregnancy duration should effectively start from an earlier point within her cycle.  \nWe need to subtract approximately this difference from the due date calculated by the standard 28-day cycle.  \nNow, if we simplify and say that the difference effectively moves the due date forward approximately by the cycle difference (because the conception happens earlier within that cycle).  \nDifference = 28 - 25 = 3 days."}

The note says that he has managed his diabetes with diet management and regular exercise, suggesting no complications. - **Dementia:** Dementia or mild cognitive impairment scores 1 point according to the CCI. - **Severe Liver Disease:** The CCI includes Chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, which scores 3 points. Severe liver disease typically would be included here, so it will contribute 3 points. - **Status Post Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA):** CVA, or stroke, is included in the CCI and awards 1 point, even if there are no residual deficits. - **Connective Tissue Disease:** While connective tissue disease is an autoimmune disorder, the CCI doesn't have a direct category for it. However, the closest related categories usually include rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, both of which fall under the category of autoimmune diseases. In the CCI, rheumatoid arthritis alone doesn't get a score unless it's causing organ damage; connective tissue diseases may not get explicitly scored unless they lead to complications included in the CCI list. Since the specific complications of the connective tissue disease are not mentioned and the condition is being managed persistently (without details about organ damage or significant complications), we will assume it doesn't directly affect the CCI score unless it contributes to another condition that does. - **Leukemia:** Leukemia is included in the Charlson Comorbidity index. It is classified under \"malignancy\" and specifically has a score of 1 point. - **Hepatoblastoma (in remission):** Hepatoblastoma is a type of cancer. Malignancy, specifically other types of cancer, scores 2 points if it is metastatic or hematologic malignancy, and typically has a score of 1 point otherwise.

{"Row Number": 334, "Calculator Name": "Maintenance Fluids Calculations", "Calculator ID": "22", "Category": "physical", "Note ID": "pmc-5970484-1", "Patient Note": "A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Name": "BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B", "LLM Answer": "71", "LLM Explanation": "The task involves calculating the patient's maintenance fluid intake in mL/hr, given that their weight at the time of admission is 30 kg.

March + 9 months = December of the same year (since March + 9 months takes you from March to December). So, we have December of 2017. Starting date in December is the same as March 24th. Then we add another 7 days to this date."}

His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed.

Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient\u2019s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL.

The anion gap decreased to 16.2 mEq/L on day 2 following admission and further decreased to 13.2 mEq/L on day 3 after admission.

Therefore, \\\\u0394 gap = Initial anion gap - anion gap on day 3. \\\\u0394 gap = 20.8 mEq/L -13.2 mEq/L = 7.6 mEq/L.", "LLM Thinking": "Step-by-step thinking process to solve the question: Step 1: First, we need to calculate the anion gap for both the initial and final measurements mentioned in the case. The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = Sodium (Na) - (Chloride (Cl) + Bicarbonate (HCO3)) Step 2: From the information provided, the initial measurements are as follows: - Sodium (Na): 134 mmol/L, - Chloride (Cl): 105 mmol/L, - Bicarbonate (HCO3): 17 mEq/L However, the initial laboratory results mentioned that the anion gap was 20.8 mEq/L (given directly in the patient note). This indicates that the anion gap value was given directly in the note, and we'll use 20.8 mEq/L for the initial value. Step 3: Now let's calculate the change in the anion gap over time based on the information provided in the patient note. The anion gap changes were reported at different times: - Initial presentation at the emergency department: Anion gap = 20.8 mEq/L. On the first day of admission (or day 2 following the visit to the emergency department): - Day 2 after admission: Anion gap = 16.2 mEq/L. On the third day after admission (day 3): - Day 3: Anion gap = 13.2 mEq/L. Since the question asks for the *delta gap* in mEq/L, it seems to be asking about the change in the anion gap between any two key points. For this problem, we'll assume the delta gap refers to the change from the initial presentation in the emergency department (with an anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L) to the time when the anion gap improved to a specific value mentioned later on. The question might be asking for the change between the initial abnormal anion gap and a subsequent measurement. The most significant change is from the initial anion gap to when the patient was on the third day of treatment, when the anion gap approached normal values.

Thus the change (or delta) from the initial abnormal state to the recovery point on day 3 is:", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol.

Step 1: Calculate the Respiratory component. The parameter we need here is PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082. PaO\u2082 = 76 mm Hg. FiO\u2082 = 0.54 (54 %). Thus, PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 = 76 / 0.54 \u2248 140.74. Looking up the SOFA Respiratory score: - PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 \u2265 400: Score = 0. - 400 > PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 \u2265 300: Score = 1. - 300 > PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 \u2265 200: Score = 2. - 200 > PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 \u2265 100: Score = 3. - PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 < 100: Score = 4. Step 2: Calculate the Hematologic component. The metric used here is the Platelet count. The patient's platelet count is 175,000/\u00b5L. The SOFA scoring for Platelets is as follows: - Platelet count \u2265 150: Score = 0. - 150 > Platelet count \u2265 100: Score = 1. - 100 > Platelet count \u2265 50: Score = 2. - Platelet count < 50: Score = 3. Step 3: Calculate the Renal component. The parameter here is the Creatinine value or urine output. The patient's creatinine measurement is 1.4 mg/dL. The urine output over the past 24 hours is 850 mL/day. The scoring for the Renal component is based on either creatinine level or urine output: For Creatinine: - Creatinine < 1.2: Score = 0. - 1.2 \u2264 Creatinine < 1.4: Score = 1. - 1.4 \u2264 Creatinine < 1.7: Score = 2. - 1.7 \u2264 Creatinine < 2.0: Score = 3. - Creatinine \u2265 2.0: Score = 4. For Urine Output: - Urine output \u2265 200 mL / day: Score = 0. - 200 > Urine output \u2265 100 mL / day: Score = 1. - 100 > Urine output \u2265 50 mL / day: Score = 2. - Urine output < 50 mL / day: Score = 3. For the Renal component, you use the maximum score between the creatinine and urine output scores. Here, the Creatinine score is 2 and the Urine output score is 0. Step 4: Calculate the Hepatic component. The parameter here is the bilirubin level. The patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL. The scoring for bilirubin is as follows: - Bilirubin < 1.2: Score = 0. - 1.2 \u2264 Bilirubin < 1.7: Score = 1. - 1.7 \u2264 Bilirubin < 2.2: Score = 2. - 2.2 \u2264 Bilirubin < 3.5: Score = 3. - Bilirubin \u2265 3.5: Score = 4. Step 5: Calculate the Coagulation component. The parameter for the Coagulation component is the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or the Platelets. However, the note does not provide information about the INR. Since only the platelet count is provided and it's used for the Hematologic score, we look for the INR value, which is missing. By default, if we don\u2019t have specific information on INR and are using the platelet count elsewhere (where it's for the Hematologic score), we'll assume that we lack data for this component unless specified otherwise. Typically, without INR data, you can\u2019t score this component unless additional assumptions or clinical judgment are applied. For simplicity and based on the information given, I'll assume we have no measurable score for the Coagulation component due to a lack of data on INR. Step 6: Calculate the Cardiovascular component. This component involves the use of vasopressors and the mean blood pressure. The requirement is that the mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be within the normal range (usually ~65 to 100 mm Hg), and the use of any vasopressors. The patient is on multiple vasopressors - norEPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. To determine the correct score, we must categorize the types and doses of vasopressors the patient is using since the SOFA Cardiovascular score depends on both blood pressure levels and vasopressor usage. First, let's calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP can be estimated using the formula: \\[ MAP \u2248 (2 \u00d7 diastolic BP + systolic BP) / 3. \\] The patient has a systolic BP of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of 75 mm Hg. So, \\[ MAP = (2 \u00d7 75 + 120) / 3 = (150 + 120) / 3 = 270 / 3 = 90 mm Hg. \\] The patient's MAP is 90 mm Hg, which is within the normal range (>65 mm Hg). Now let's look at the SOFA Cardiovascular score based on the vasopressor usage. The scoring is based on the use and dose of vasopressors: - No vasopressors: Score = 0. - Dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or any vasopressin: Score = 1. - Dopamine \u2265 5 mcg/kg/min or Dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min + a second agent or any NE < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: Score = 2. - Dopamine \u2265 15 mcg/kg/min or NE \u2265 0.1 mcg/kg/min or Epinephrine or norepinephrine > 0.1 mcg/kg/min or dopamine any dose + norepinephrine or epinephrine: Score = 3 or higher. Let's evaluate the vasopressors the patient is receiving: - NorEPINEPHrine (norepinephrine) at 0.1 mcg/kg/min. - EPINEPHrine (epinephrine) at 0.1 mcg/kg/min. - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min. - DOBUTamine does not count as a vasopressor that increases the SOFA cardiovascular score in the standard scoring because it's an inotrope primarily used to improve cardiac contractility. Given the dosages, we have: - Norepinephrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min (\u2265 0.1 mcg/kg/min). - Epinephrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min (indicates use of epinephrine). - Dopamine: 7 mcg/kg/min. According to the scoring rules: If a patient is receiving Norepinephrine \u2265 0.1 mcg/kg/min or epinephrine, the score is quite high. The presence of either norepinephrine at \u2265 0.1 mcg/kg/min or epinephrine at any dose automatically puts the patient into the most severe category for the Cardiovascular score. Now, we'll sum up the scores for all the components we've calculated:", "Ground Truth Answer": "10", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's current SOFA score is 0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 76.0 mm Hg and FiO\u2082 percentage is 54.0 %. This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is 1.407. The patient is reported to be on mechanical ventillation. Whether the patient is on continuous positive airway pressure is not reported and so we assume this to be false. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is less than 100, and the patient is using at least one of (i) mechanical ventillation or (ii) continious positive airway pressure, we increase the score by four points, makeing the current total 0 + 4 = 4.\nFor two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 10 and 12, we add 2 points to the score, making the current score 6 + 2 = 8.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 2.3 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 2.0 mg/dL but less than 6.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by two points, make the current score 8 + 2 = 10.\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 175000.0 count/\u00b5L. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10\u00b3/\u00b5L, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 10.\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 10 points.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "Let's calculate the patient's SOFA score systematically, considering the different components of the SOFA score: Respiratory, Hematologic, Renal, Hepatic, Coagulation, and Cardiovascular.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Respiratory component.  \nThe parameter we need here is PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082.  \nPaO\u2082 = 76 mm Hg.  \nFiO\u2082 = 0.54 (54 %).  \nThus, PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 = 76 / 0.54 \u2248 140.74.  \nLooking up the SOFA Respiratory score:  \n -

Total Bilirubin level, 2. Serum Albumin level, 3. Prothrombin Time/INR, 4. Presence of ascites, 5. Encephalopathy. The Child-Pugh classification assigns points for each of these criteria and then categorizes the liver function into grades A, B, and C. Here\u2019s how we evaluate each criterion based on the given patient data: 1. Total Bilirubin: - The given total bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh score guidelines: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3 to < 6 mg/dL = 3 points - >= 6 mg/dL = 4 points. Since the bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL, it falls into the \"< 2 mg/dL\" range if we strictly interpret it. However, the classification for bilirubin that ranges between exactly 2.0 mg/dL would usually fall into the \"> 1 and <= 2\" category, but since it is listed as 2.0 mg/dL exactly, it falls in the range of \"2 - 3 mg/dL\". Thus, for 2.0 mg/dL: - It fits into the 2-3 mg/dL range, so it gives 2 points. 2. Serum Albumin: - The given serum albumin is 3.2 g/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh score guidelines: - >= 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.4 g/dL = 2 points - 2.1-2.7 g/dL = 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL = 4 points. Since the albumin level is 3.2 g/dL: - This falls between 2.8 - 3.4 g/dL. So it assigns 2 points. 3. Prothrombin Time (INR): - The given INR is 1.9. - According to the Child-Pugh score guidelines: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7 - 2.3 = 2 points - 2.4 - 2.9 = 3 points - >= 3 = 4 points. Since the INR is 1.9: - This falls within the range 1.7 - 2.3, which corresponds to 2 points. 4. Presence of Ascites: - The patient note states \"There was no evidence of ascites.\" Thus, - No ascites = 1 point. 5. Encephalopathy: - The patient note describes \"slight mental slowness and mild asterixis.\" We need to categorize this under the grade of encephalopathy. According to the Child-Pugh criteria for encephalopathy: - None = 1 point, - Grade 1 or Grade 2 = 2 points, - Grade 3 or Grade 4 = 3 points. \"Slight mental slowness\" and \"mild asterixis\" can be interpreted as mild neurologic findings which typically correspond to **Grade 1** of hepatic encephalopathy. So, mild asterixis likely corresponds to Grade 1 encephalopathy. Therefore, it gets 2 points. Now, let's sum up the points from all the criteria: 1. Bilirubin = 2 points 2.

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation.

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 \u00b5mol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient\u2019s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits.

A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws.

For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.", "Question": "What is the patient\u2019s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "LLM Name": "BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B", "LLM Answer": "0", "LLM Explanation": "To approach this question, I'll think through it step by-step. 1.

Here are the details from the patient's information: - Age: 67 years - Gender: Female - Smoking: No (she does not smoke) - Diabetes: Not mentioned, so we'll assume she does not have diabetes unless stated otherwise. Let's go with no diabetes for the calculation. - Total cholesterol: 196 mg/dL - HDL cholesterol: 50 mg/dL - Systolic blood pressure: 140 mm Hg - On BP medication: Yes (she takes lisinopril and metoprolol). The Framingham Risk Score for women includes the following components. We'll use the point system for calculating the score and then convert the total points to a risk of 10-year cardiovascular disease events. Step 2: Assign points for each category using the Framingham Risk Score tables for women. **Age**: 67 From the age table for women: - 65-69 years = 8 points. **Smoking status**: No From the smoking table for women: - Nonsmoker = 0 points. **Diabetes status**: No (as per our assumption) From the diabetes table for women: - No diabetes = 0 points. **Total Cholesterol**: 196 mg/dL From the total cholesterol table for women: - Total Cholesterol 196-200 mg/dL would fall into the range >200. The closest ranges given are: | Total Cholesterol Category | Points | |----------------------------|--------| | <160 | 0 | | 160-199 | 3 | | 200-239 | 6 | | 240-279 | 8 | | \u2265 280 | 9 | Since 196 falls within the 160-199 mg/dL range, - Total Cholesterol = 196 mg/dL corresponds to 3 points. **HDL cholesterol**: 50 mg/dL From the HDL table for women: | HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL) | Points | |------------------------|--------| | < 35 | +7 | | 35-44 | +5 | | 45-49 | +3 | | 50-59 | +2 | | 60-69 | +1 | | \u2265 70 | 0 | Since HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL, it falls into the range 50-59, corresponding to +2 points. **Systolic BP** and **BP Medication Status**: The systolic BP is 140 mm Hg, and she is on blood pressure medication. We need to look up both the systolic blood pressure and the fact that she's on medication. From the systolic blood pressure table: For those on medication: - 120-129 = 2 points - 130-139 = 4 points - 140-149 = 6 points - 150-159 = 8 points - 160-169 = 10 points - \u2265170 = 11 points Since her systolic BP is 140 mm Hg, and she is on BP medication, we use the range for 140-149 mm Hg. This gives us 6 points. Now let's sum up all the points: - Age: 8 points - Smoking status: 0 points - Diabetes: 0 points - Total Cholesterol: 3 points - HDL Cholesterol: 2 points - Systolic BP and on BP medication: 6 points Adding these up: \\[ 8 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 19 \\] Step 3: Convert the total points (19) to a 10-year cardiovascular risk percentage for women. According to the Framingham Risk Score table for women, the point system converts to risk percentages. For a total score of 19 points, we need to use the table that translates points to 10-year risk percentages. From the points-to-percent conversion table for women: | Points | Risk of CHD (% in 10 years) | |--------|-----------------------------| |... | | | 15 | 8.5 | | 16 | 10 | | 17 | 12 | | 18 | 14 | | 19 | 16.2 | |... | | Upon closer inspection, we might use an integer range for the next closest: For 19 points: If we interpolate between nearby scores, For 18 points: risk is around 14% However, if we need to provide it step-by-step process and the final Framingham Risk point: The total score = 19 points.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female.\nFor females, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 31.764001 * ln(age) + 22.465206 * ln(total_cholestrol) - 1.187731 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 2.552905 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.420251 * bp_medicine + 13.07543 * smoker + -5.060998 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.996945 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker - 146.5933061, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 67 years old. The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Thought Type": "with_sampling_without_answer", "Transferred Thoughts": "To calculate the Framingham Risk Score for this 67-year-old female patient, let's break down the process step-by-step:  \nStep 1: Identify the key variables needed for the Framingham Risk Score, which include age, gender, smoking status, presence of diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and whether the patient is on BP medication. Here are the details from the patient's information:  \n- Age: 67 years  \n- Gender: Female  \n- Smoking: No (she does not smoke)  \n- Diabetes: Not mentioned, so we'll assume she does not have diabetes unless stated otherwise. Let's go with no diabetes for the calculation.  \n- Total cholesterol: 196 mg/dL  \n- HDL cholesterol: 50 mg/dL  \n- Systolic blood pressure: 140 mm Hg  \n- On BP medication: Yes (she takes lisinopril and metoprolol).  \nThe Framingham Risk Score for women includes the following components. We'll use the point system for calculating the score and then convert the total points to a risk of 10-year cardiovascular disease events.  \nStep 2: Assign points for each category using the Framingham Risk Score tables for women.  \n**Age**: 67  \nFrom the age table for women:  \n- 65-69 years = 8 points.  \n**Smoking status**: No  \nFrom the smoking table for women:  \n- Nonsmoker = 0 points.  \n**Diabetes status**: No (as per our assumption)  \nFrom the diabetes table for women:  \n- No diabetes = 0 points.  \n**Total Cholesterol**: 196 mg/dL  \nFrom the total cholesterol table for women:  \n- Total Cholesterol 196-200 mg/dL would fall into the range >200.  \nThe closest ranges given are:  \n| Total Cholesterol Category | Points |  \n|----------------------------|--------|  \n| <160                       | 0      |  \n| 160-199                    | 3      |  \n| 200-239                    | 6      |  \n| 240-279                    | 8      |  \n| \u2265 280                      | 9      |  \nSince 196 falls within the 160-199 mg/dL range,  \n- Total Cholesterol = 196 mg/dL corresponds to 3 points.  \n**HDL cholesterol**: 50 mg/dL  \nFrom the HDL table for women:  \n| HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL) | Points |  \n|------------------------|--------|  \n| < 35                   | +7     |  \n| 35-44                  | +5     |  \n| 45-49                  | +3     |  \n| 50-59                  | +2     |  \n| 60-69                  | +1     |  \n| \u2265 70                   | 0      |  \nSince HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL, it falls into the range 50-59, corresponding to +2 points.  \n**Systolic BP** and **BP Medication Status**: The systolic BP is 140 mm Hg, and she is on blood pressure medication.

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 \u00b5mol/L; normal 2.6\u201352.2 \u00b5mol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8\u20136.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5\u201314.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 \u00d7 109/L; normal 4\u201312 \u00d7 109/L), platelet count (23 \u00d7 109/L; normal 150\u2013400 \u00d7 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5\u20132.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150\u2013500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80\u20131.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16\u20130.48 g/L).

Typically, conception is estimated to occur around the time of ovulation. For a regular menstrual cycle, ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. Given: - The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 08/22/2014. - The cycle length is 27 days. Step 1: Calculate the next expected menstrual period. If the LMP was on 08/22/2014 and the cycle length is 27 days, the next menstrual period is 27 days after 08/22/2014. Let's calculate this: - August has 31 days. - If the LMP is 08/22/2014, adding 27 days from that date: Count the remaining days in August after 08/22: Total days in August - 22 = 31 - 22 = 9. We have already used 9 out of the 27 days within August. Hence the remaining days to add within the next months are \\(27 - 9 = 18\\) days. Add these 18 days to September since the remaining part of the cycle will fall into September. September has 30 days.

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted.

Low voltage is observed on the ECG. Since the ECG shows low voltages in the limb leads and no significant ST-segment or T-wave changes suggestive of ischemia or STEMI, and assuming that the low voltages do not point towards any significant pathological ST changes, we should classify it under non-pathologic changes unless otherwise stated.

Since there are 7 days in one week:  \n\\[ \\text{Number of weeks} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{256}{7} \\right\\rfloor \\]  \nTo get the number of remaining days:  \n\\[ \\text{Remaining days} = 256 - (\\text{Number of weeks} \\times 7) \\]"}
