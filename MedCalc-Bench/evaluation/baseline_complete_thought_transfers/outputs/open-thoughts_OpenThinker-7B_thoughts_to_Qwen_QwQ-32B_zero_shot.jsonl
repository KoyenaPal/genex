His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 364. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 135.0 mm Hg = 95.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 95.0 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.

She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution ().

Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles.

Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table .

However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones.

Then subtracted cAG from the measured AG (22) to get the delta gap (-7.008), rounding to -7.0 mEq/L.", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "10", "Target Explanation": "The albumin-corrected anion gap is calculated using the formula: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3] + 0.25 * [Albumin]). The given values are sodium 148 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, bicarbonate 6 mmol/L, and serum albumin 4.2 g/L. Plugging in the numbers: 148 - (110 + 6 + 0.25*4.2). First, calculate 0.25 * 4.2 = 1.05. Then sum Cl (110) + HCO3 (6) + 1.05 = 117.05. Subtract this from Na: 148 - 117.05 = 30.95. However, the patient's actual anion gap is given as 22. The question asks for the corrected delta gap, which is the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap (usually 12). The corrected delta gap would be 22 - 12 = 10. However, since the question specifies 'albumin corrected delta gap', it might refer to adjusting the anion gap for albumin first. Wait, the formula for corrected anion gap adjusts for low albumin. The standard formula is Anion Gap + 0.25*(4 - Albumin). Since her albumin is 4.2 g/dL, which is slightly above the lower normal (typically 3.5-5.0), the correction would be minimal. Let me recalculate. The formula is: Corrected Anion Gap = Measured Anion Gap + [0.25 \u00d7 (4.0 - Albumin)]. Her albumin is 4.2, so 4.0 - 4.2 = -0.2. Thus, 0.25*(-0.2) = -0.05. So corrected AG = 22 - 0.05 = 21.95. The delta gap is the measured AG minus normal AG (12), so 22 -12 =10. Since the albumin correction here is negligible, the answer is 10. But the question says 'albumin corrected delta gap', so maybe the delta gap is calculated after correcting AG for albumin. If corrected AG is ~22 (since the adjustment was minimal), delta gap remains 10. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the corrected anion gap first, then delta gap.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

The formula for the anion gap is (Na - (Cl + HCO3)). The albumin correction is applied because hypoalbuminemia can affect the anion gap. The formula for the corrected anion gap is: Anion gap + (25 - measured albumin (g/dL)) * 2.6. From the patient's lab results: Sodium is 139 mEq/L, chloride is 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate is 30 mEq/L, and albumin is 1.5 g/dL. First, calculate the anion gap: 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 mEq/L. Next, apply the albumin correction: 25 - 1.5 = 23.5. Multiply this by 2.6: 23.5 * 2.6 = 61.1. Add this to the original anion gap: 7 + 61.1 = 68.1 mEq/L. However, this result seems extremely high and may indicate an error. Rechecking the formula: The standard anion gap is correct. The albumin correction formula is sometimes debated, but the common formula is (2.6 x (4 - albumin)). Since the patient's albumin is 1.5, the correction would be 2.6*(4 -1.5)=2.6*2.5=6.5. Adding this to the anion gap: 7 +6.5=13.5. Wait, different sources use different baseline albumin values (some use 4 g/dL instead of 2.5). Let me confirm. The standard formula for albumin correction is: Corrected AG = Measured AG + [2.6 x (4.0 - measured albumin)]. Since the patient's albumin is 1.5, the calculation is 2.6*(4-1.5)=2.6*2.5=6.5. Original AG was 7, so corrected AG is 7+6.5=13.5 mEq/L. The initial approach using 25 was incorrect because the baseline albumin should be 4, not 25.

The patient has insulin-treated diabetes (1 point), renal insufficiency is not met since her creatinine is 120 \u00b5mol/L (cutoff is >200), but the surgery is high-risk (1 point).

To calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding (GBS) score, I need to assess the parameters outlined in the scoring system. The GBS uses factors like systolic blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, BUN, comorbidities, and other clinical indicators. \\n\\nStarting with the vital signs: The patient's systolic BP is 130 mmHg (which is \u2265100 mmHg, so 0 points), heart rate is 88 bpm (\u2264100 bpm, so 0 points). Hemoglobin is 13 g/dL, which is \u22657 but <9 would get 2 points, but since it's 13, that's 0 points. BUN is 18 mg/dL; since it's <10 mg/dL difference from creatinine (assuming normal BUN/creatinine ratio isn't provided, but the score might just look at absolute BUN. However, the GBS criteria for BUN is if it's \u226515 mg/dL, which would be 1 point. Wait, checking the exact GBS criteria: BUN \u226515 mg/dL is 1 point. So 18 is \u226515, so 1 point. \\n\\nComorbidities: The patient has no history of heart failure, so that's 0. Other factors: The presence of melena itself is part of the score. The GBS gives points for melena (as opposed to hematemesis). Melena is worth 1 point. Additionally, the presence of an ulcer (as a known diagnosis) might contribute, but in GBS, the underlying cause isn't directly scored unless it's varices or something else. Since it's a peptic ulcer, that's considered, but the scoring might not add points for that specifically. \\n\\nThe total points would be: BUN 1 point, melena 1 point. Are there other factors? Let me check again. The GBS also includes: systolic BP <90 (0), HR >100 (0), hemoglobin <7 (0), 7-9 (0 here since Hb is 13), age over 60 gives 1 point. Wait, age over 60 is a point? Let me confirm. The GBS scoring: Age \u226560 years: 1 point. So the patient is 69, so +1. \\n\\nSo adding up: age 1, BUN 1, melena 1. Total of 3 points. Wait, but I might be missing other components. Let me go step by step according to the GBS criteria:\\n\\nGlasgow-Blatchford Score components:\\n- Systolic BP <90: 4 points (no, patient has 130)\\n- HR >100: 2 points (no, 88)\\n- Hemoglobin <7: 3 points; 7-9: 2 points; 9-10:1 point; \u226510:0. Here Hb is 13, so 0.\\n- BUN \u226515: 1 point (yes, 18 so 1)\\n- Coma or Altered Mental Status: 2 (no)\\n- Cardiac history (heart failure, MI, angina): 0 (patient denies heart failure)\\n- Renal failure: 1 (not indicated)\\n- Liver disease: 1 (not indicated)\\n- Melena: 1 point\\n- Hematemesis or hematochezia: not present here, only melena\\n- Age \u226560: 1 point\\n\\nTotal points: BUN (1) + Melena (1) + Age (1) = 3.

Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge.

The units for anion gap are usually mEq/L, which is consistent here.", "Ground Truth Answer": "39.2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 144.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41\u03bcg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.\nOn the basis of the patient\u2019s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root.

A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2\u20139 mm) observed in the right ovary ().\nThe patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope\u00ae; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies.

On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa ().

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse.

Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m\u00b2. His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL.

Both values here are 30 mmol/L, resulting in a delta gap of 0 mEq/L.", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "3", "Target Explanation": "The patient's anion gap is given as 30 mmol/L. The delta gap is calculated by subtracting the expected high-normal anion gap (usually 12 mmol/L) from the measured anion gap. However, the standard formula for delta gap is typically not subtracting a baseline but rather part of the anion gap equation. Wait, actually, the delta gap is calculated as (Measured Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap) minus (Serum Sodium - (2 x Serum CO2) - Serum potassium). But perhaps the user is referring to the anion gap itself. Wait, the question specifically asks for delta gap. Let me recall: Delta gap = (Measured AG - 12) - [(Na - (2 x HCO3) - K)]. The normal anion gap is around 12. Let's compute that. The measured AG is 30. The HCO3 is 9. The sodium is 137, potassium is 5.0. So: (30 - 12) - [(137 - (2*9) -5)] = 18 - [137 -18 -5] = 18 - (114) = -96. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the delta gap is simply the anion gap minus the expected anion gap, but that would be 30-12=18. But the term delta gap might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the anion gap itself, but the question says delta gap. Alternatively, maybe the delta gap is calculated as (Anion gap - (sodium - (2*HCO3 - K))). Wait, different sources might have different formulas. Let me check the standard approach. The delta gap is part of the anion gap and HCO3 analysis. The delta ratio is (Anion gap - 12)/(22 - HCO3). But delta gap might refer to the difference between the anion gap and the expected. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick because the delta gap isn't commonly used. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and wants the anion gap, which is given as 30. Alternatively, perhaps the delta gap refers to the difference between the measured and expected anion gap. Since the normal AG is 8-16, so 30 is elevated. The delta gap would be 30 - 12 = 18. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is delta gap = AG - (2*(24 - HCO3)). Not sure. Given the confusion, but the question is about delta gap. Since the anion gap is 30, and the HCO3 is 9, the delta gap is calculated as (AG - 12) - (24 - HCO3). Wait, another formula: Delta gap = (AG - 12) - (24 - HCO3). So (30-12)=18 minus (24-9)=15, so 18-15=3. That might be the case. Alternatively, some sources say delta gap = (AG - 12) - (24 - HCO3). So 30-12=18; 24-9=15; 18-15=3. So the delta gap would be 3. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the anion gap itself, but the question specifies delta gap. Given the possible formulas, the most plausible answer is 3 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "18", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

The patient\u2019s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient\u2019s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17\u20131.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5\u20136.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient\u2019s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Model": "open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B", "LLM Answer": "-18.3", "LLM Raw Thinking": "No Explanation", "LLM Explanation": "To determine the delta gap, first identify the measured serum potassium (3.7 mmol/L). Calculate the anion gap (AG = 13 mmol/L) using sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. The calculated potassium is derived from AG + HCO3\u207b - 10, yielding 22 mmol/L. Subtracting this from the measured potassium gives the delta gap (-18.3 mEq/L).", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "-6", "Target Explanation": "The delta gap is calculated as the difference between the anion gap and the bicarbonate level. First, I need to find the anion gap and the bicarbonate values from the lab results provided. The anion gap is calculated using the formula: Na - (Cl + HCO3). Looking at the lab values: Sodium is 135 mmol/L, chloride is 103 mmol/L, and bicarbonate is 19 mmol/L. Plugging these into the formula: Anion gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 mmol/L. The bicarbonate level is 19 mmol/L. The delta gap is then Anion gap - (2 x HCO3) = 13 - (2 x 19) = 13 - 38 = -25. However, the delta gap is typically calculated as (Anion gap - 12) - (24 - HCO3), but different sources may vary. Wait, let me confirm the correct formula. The standard delta gap formula is (Anion gap - 12) divided by (24 - HCO3). But the question asks for delta gap in mEq/L, which might refer to the anion gap minus twice the bicarbonate deficit. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the anion gap minus the bicarbonate. Let me recalculate. If the anion gap is 13 and bicarbonate is 19, then delta gap would be 13 - 19 = -6. But I need to ensure the correct formula. Alternatively, the delta ratio is (Anion gap - 12)/(24 - HCO3). But the question specifically asks for delta gap, not ratio. Since the user might be referring to the difference between anion gap and bicarbonate, the calculation would be 13 (anion gap) minus 19 (bicarbonate) equals -6 mEq/L. However, some sources define delta gap as the anion gap minus the normal bicarbonate (24) plus the actual bicarbonate. Wait, confusion here. Let me check again. The standard approach: Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 135 - (103 +19)=13. The bicarbonate is 19. The delta gap is (Anion gap - 12) - (24 - HCO3). So (13-12) - (24-19)=1 -5= -4. But the question says delta gap in mEq/L. Alternatively, perhaps the delta gap is simply Anion gap minus (2*(24 - HCO3)). Not sure. Alternatively, the delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the bicarbonate. So 13-19= -6. Since the question is ambiguous, but common practice is delta ratio is (AG-12)/(24-HCO3). But the question asks for delta gap, which might be the numerator: AG -12 =1. But the answer is likely -6 or -4. Wait, the user might have a specific formula in mind. Let me see the values again. The anion gap is 13, bicarbonate is 19. The delta gap is calculated as (Anion gap - 12) minus (24 - HCO3). So (1) - (5) = -4. Alternatively, some sources say delta gap is (AG - 12) divided by (24 - HCO3). But the question says delta gap, not ratio. Since the user is asking for delta gap in mEq/L, perhaps it's the anion gap minus the bicarbonate. 13-19= -6. Alternatively, the delta gap is the anion gap minus the normal bicarbonate (24) plus the actual bicarbonate? Not sure. Given the confusion, but the most common formula for delta gap is (AG - 12) divided by (24 - HCO3). But the question might be expecting the numerator, which is AG -12 =1. Alternatively, the delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the bicarbonate. Since the answer is required, I'll go with the anion gap minus bicarbonate: 13-19= -6 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol. To convert 40.2 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 8.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5\u2103. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm\u00d72.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of \u03b22-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma.

He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease.

Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", "LLM Model": "open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B", "LLM Answer": "988.6", "LLM Raw Thinking": "No Explanation", "LLM Explanation": "Calculated adjusted body weight as 68 kg (BMI normal). Applied Cockcroft-Gault formula: (140-66)*68 /5.09 = 988.6 mL/min.", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "11", "Target Explanation": "First, I need to calculate the patient's BMI to determine if their adjusted body weight should be used. The patient's height is 168 cm and weight is 68 kg. BMI is calculated as (weight in kg) / (height in meters)^2. Converting height to meters: 168 cm = 1.68 m. BMI = 68 / (1.68 * 1.68) \u2248 24.02. Since the BMI is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), the adjusted body weight is the minimum of ideal body weight and actual weight. Ideal body weight for a male is calculated as 50 kg + 0.9 kg per inch over 5 feet. The patient's height is 168 cm, which is approximately 66 inches (168/2.54 \u2248 66). 66 inches is 5 feet 6 inches. The inches over 5 feet is 6 inches. Ideal body weight = 50 + (6 * 0.9) = 50 + 5.4 = 55.4 kg. Since the actual weight (68 kg) is higher than the ideal (55.4 kg), the adjusted weight is 55.4 kg. Next, apply the Cockroft-Gault equation. For a male: CrCl = [(140 - age) * weight (kg) * (1.23 if female)] / (72 \u00d7 serum creatinine mg/dL). The patient is male, 66 years old, serum creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. Plugging in values: [(140 - 66) * 55.4] / (72 * 5.09). Calculate numerator: (74 * 55.4) \u2248 4099.6.

However, since the Cockroft-Gault equation typically uses mg/dL for creatinine and the result is in mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, but the question asks for mL/min without adjusting for BSA. Wait, the standard formula does account for body surface area implicitly through the weight. Wait, the Cockroft-Gault formula as written gives mL/min without needing BSA. Let me recalculate precisely: (140-66)=74; 74*55.4=4099.6; 4099.6/(72*5.09)=4099.6/366.48\u224811.19 mL/min. Since the patient is male, no 1.23 multiplier. The answer is approximately 11 mL/min.", "Ground Truth Answer": "12.949", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities.

Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized.

From the lab results, the corrected sodium is 133 mmol/L, glucose is 569 mg/dL, and BUN is 25.9 mg/dL. Convert glucose and BUN to mmol/L if necessary, but the formula typically uses mg/dL values. Plugging in the numbers: 2\u00d7133 = 266, plus 569 = 835, plus 25.9 \u2248 860.9 mOsm/kg. However, the formula might require dividing BUN by 2.8. Let me check: BUN (mg/dL) divided by 2.8 gives mmol/L, but in the osmolality formula, BUN is used as mg/dL. Wait, the standard formula is 2[Na] + [glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8. Wait, different sources might vary. Let me confirm the exact formula. The standard serum osmolality calculation is: 2\u00d7Na + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8. But sometimes simplified as 2\u00d7Na + glucose + BUN, but that's less accurate. Let me recalculate using the standard formula. Sodium is 133 mmol/L. Glucose is 569 mg/dL. Since glucose contributes 1 mOsm/kg per mg/dL divided by 18 (since glucose's molecular weight is ~180). So glucose contribution is 569/18 \u2248 31.6. BUN is 25.9 mg/dL. BUN is urea nitrogen, which is (mg/dL)/2.8 \u2248 mmol/L, and each mmol contributes 0.357 mOsm/kg (since urea is 60 g/mol, so 1 mmol is 0.357 mOsm). Alternatively, the formula is BUN/2.8 gives mmol/L, and each mmol is 0.357 mOsm/kg, so total is (25.9/2.8)*0.357 \u2248 (9.25)*0.357 \u2248 3.3. Alternatively, some sources use BUN/2.8 as part of the formula. Wait, the standard formula is: Osmolality \u2248 2[Na] + (glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8).

However, the question might be expecting a simplified version where glucose and BUN are added directly in mg/dL. But the correct formula uses the divided values. The answer should be approximately 307 mOsm/kg. However, looking at the data again, the sodium is corrected to 133 mmol/L. Let me confirm the values again: Sodium 133, glucose 569, BUN 25.9.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings.

His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein.

Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen.

The delta gap is calculated as the anion gap minus the normal anion gap (which is typically between 8-12 mEq/L). The normal anion gap is around 12 mEq/L. Therefore, the delta gap would be 20.8 - 12 = 8.8 mEq/L. However, the term 'delta gap' is sometimes confused with 'delta' in acid-base disorders, which refers to the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal value. The question specifically asks for the delta gap, which in this context is the difference from the normal. So the calculation is 20.8 - 12 = 8.8 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L.

Syncope in the context of cardiac symptoms is a significant red flag. The chest pain is considered 'high' risk due to the presence of syncope and palpitations.\\n\\n2. **ECG results**: The initial ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in aVL. These changes can indicate ischemia or other cardiac issues. However, subsequent angiography showed normal coronaries, suggesting non-ischemic causes. Later ECGs showed ventricular bigeminy, R on T phenomenon, polymorphic VT, and Brugada-like patterns. The presence of ST changes and life-threatening arrhythmias would classify the ECG as 'abnormal'.\\n\\n3. **Age**: The patient is 35 years old. Since he is under 45, this component scores as 'low' risk.\\n\\n4. **Risk factors**: He is a regular smoker (20 cigarettes/day), which is a major risk factor. Smoking contributes to cardiovascular risk, so this is 'present'.\\n\\n5. **Troponin**: The note mentions no biochemical abnormalities, and specifically states magnesium and potassium were normal. However, troponin levels aren't explicitly mentioned. If troponin is normal or not measured, this component would be 'negative'.\\n\\nScoring each component:\\n- History: High (2 points)\\n- ECG: Abnormal (2 points)\\n- Age: <45 (0 points)\\n- Risk factors: Present (1 point)\\n- Troponin: Negative (0 points)\\n\\nTotal HEART score = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5.\\n\\nHowever, the HEART score categorization is as follows: 0-3 = low risk, 4-6 = intermediate, 7-10 = high.

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation.

After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta.

To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol.

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient\u2019s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.", "Question": "What is the patient's HEART score?", "LLM Model": "open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B", "LLM Answer": "2", "LLM Raw Thinking": "No Explanation", "LLM Explanation": "The HEART score evaluates pericardial effusion risk using five components. After reviewing the patient's history (no relevant factors), echocardiogram (tamponade and moderate effusion), respiratory symptoms (chest pain/shortness of breath), and other factors (no angina or trauma), the score totals 2 points.", "Target Model": "Qwen/QwQ-32B", "Target Answer": "6", "Target Explanation": "The HEART score is used to assess the risk of adverse cardiac events in patients with possible acute coronary syndrome. It includes five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. The patient's history includes pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, which are atypical for ACS. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages but no ST changes, which is 1 point. Age 47 is 0 points. Risk factors include diabetes and hypertension, totaling 2 points. Troponin initially was elevated (0.481 ng/ml) but downtrended, so this is 1 point. Summing these: 0 (History) + 1 (ECG) + 0 (Age) + 2 (Risk) + 1 (Troponin) = 4. However, the HEART score requires categorizing each component into low, medium, high risk. The total score ranges from 0-10, with higher scores indicating higher risk. However, the patient's main issues were pericardial effusion and tamponade, not ACS. The HEART score may not be fully applicable here, but based on given data, the components would sum to 4, which is a medium risk. However, considering the context, the primary issue is pericardial disease, so the HEART score might not be the focus. But strictly following the components: History (atypical = 2?), ECG (low voltage but no ischemia = 1), Age (47 = 0), Risk factors (2), Troponin (elevated then down = 1). If History is 2, total is 6. Different sources may score History differently. The exact scoring can vary, but likely the answer is 6.", "Ground Truth Answer": "5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current HEART Score is 0.\nThe value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Highly suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'history', increasing the current total to 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Normal'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', keeping the current total at 2.\nThe patient is 47.0 years old. The patient's age is between 45 and 65 years and so we increment the current total by 1, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe following risk factor(s) are present based on the patient's note: hypertension, diabetes mellitus. The following risk factor(s) are mentioned in the patient's note, but these risk factors are noted to be absent from the patient: atherosclerotic disease. The following risk factor(s) are missing from the patient's data: atherosclerotic disease. We will assume that these are all absent from the patient. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 2 risk factors are present and so 1 point is added for the risk factors criteria, making the current total, 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe value of 'initial troponin' in the patient's note is determined to be 'between the normal limit or up to three times the normal limit'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 1 point is added for 'initial troponin', increasing the current total to 4 + 1 = 5.\nBased on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 5.", "Result": "Incorrect", "Target Result": "Incorrect"}
