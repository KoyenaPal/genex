 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

So score 5.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we need to evaluate the patient against each component of the HAS-BLED scoring system. The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those who might require anticoagulation. The components are as follows: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg) - A: Abnormal renal/liver function - S: Stroke history - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation) - E: Elderly (>65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of NSAIDs or alcohol) Let's evaluate the patient against each component: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg)** - The patient has well-documented uncontrolled hypertension. While the specific systolic blood pressure (SBP) is not provided, the term "uncontrolled hypertension" suggests that it is likely high enough to meet this criterion. Therefore, this component scores 1. 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function** - The patient has both renal impairment (elevated creatinine and reduced GFR) and liver impairment (hepatic impairment due to ALD). This component includes both abnormal renal and liver function, so it scores 1 for abnormal renal function and 1 for abnormal liver function. However, the HAS-BLED score typically counts abnormal renal or liver function as one point. Since the patient has both, we count this as 1 point. 3. **S: Stroke history** - The patient has no history of stroke. Therefore, this component scores 0. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - There is no mention of a bleeding history or any condition that predisposes the patient to bleeding. Therefore, this component scores 0. 5. **L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation)** - The patient has never been prescribed medication known to accelerate bleeding and has a consistently normal INR. Therefore, this component scores 0. 6. **E: Elderly (>65 years)** - The patient is 72 years old, which is over 65. Therefore, this component scores 1. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of NSAIDs or alcohol)** - The patient admits to consuming alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. According to the HAS-BLED criteria, alcohol use of more than 8 drinks per week or more than 1 drink per day is considered a risk factor. Since the patient consumes 9 drinks per week, this criterion is met. Therefore, this component scores 1. Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal renal/liver function): 1 - S (Stroke history): 0 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly > 65): 1 - D (Drugs/alcohol): 1 Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 0 (S) + 0 (B) + 0 (L) + 1 (E) + 1 (D) = 4. So the total HAS-BLED score is 4.", "answer": "4"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

Step 1: Identify the required information for the Framingham Risk Score calculation. The Framingham Risk Score requires the following information: - Age - Sex - Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Systolic Blood Pressure - Treatment for hypertension (yes/no) - Smoking status - Diabetes status From the patient note, we have the following information: - Age: 50 years old - Sex: Male - LDL: 107 mg/dL - HDL: 43 mg/dL - Blood Pressure: 131/83 mm Hg (so systolic BP is 131 mm Hg) - Smoking history: 3-pack year smoking history (implies he is a smoker or was a smoker) - Diabetes: No history of diabetes - Hypertension: No history of hypertension - Dyslipidemia: No history of dyslipidemia We do not have the total cholesterol level directly.

{'Row Number': 561, 'Calculator Name': 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Calculator ID': '46', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4429202-1', 'Patient Note': "A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.", 'Question': "What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

We have limited data. Likely cannot compute exactly. Probably answer "Cannot be determined with given data."</think> But let's break this down step-by-step using the information provided and calculate what we can. Step 1: Identify the components of the APACHE II score: The APACHE II score consists of three parts: 1. The Acute Physiology Score (APS), which is based on 12 physiological variables. 2. Age points. 3. Chronic Health points. Step 2: Let's calculate the Acute Physiology Score (APS) using the given data. The 12 variables for the Acute Physiology Score are: - Age - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) - Heart Rate - Respiratory Rate - PaO2/FiO2 ratio - pH - PaCO2 - Temperature - White Blood Cell Count (WBC) - Sodium - Potassium - Creatinine Let's calculate each one that we have data for: 1. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):** - The patient has a GCS of 14. - From the APACHE II scoring table for GCS: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 14: 1 point - GCS 13: 2 points - GCS 12: 3 points - GCS 11: 4 points - GCS 10: 5 points - GCS 9: 6 points - GCS 8: 7 points - GCS 7: 8 points - GCS 6: 9 points - GCS 5: 10 points - GCS 4: 11 points - GCS 3: 12 points - GCS 2: 13 points - GCS 1: 14 points - For GCS 14, the score is 1 point. 2. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** - We have the blood pressure as 135/75 mm Hg. - MAP can be calculated using the formula: MAP = Diastolic BP + 1/3 (Systolic BP - Diastolic BP). - MAP = 75 + 1/3 * (135 - 75) = 75 + 1/3 * 60 = 75 + 20 = 95 mm Hg. - From the APACHE II scoring table for MAP: - MAP < 30: 6 points - 30-39: 5 points - 40-49: 4 points - 50-59: 3 points - 60-69: 2 points - 70-79: 1 point - 80-89: 0 points - 90-109: 0 points - 110-119: 1 point - 120-129: 2 points - 130-139: 3 points - 140-149: 4 points - 150-159: 5 points - 160-169: 6 points - 170-179: 7 points - 180-189: 8 points - 190-199: 9 points - 200+: 10 points - For MAP = 95 mm Hg, the score is 0 points. 3. **Heart Rate:** - The patient has a heart rate of 95 beats per minute. - From the APACHE II scoring table for Heart Rate: - < 40: 4 points - 40-49: 3 points - 50-59: 2 points - 60-69: 1 point - 70-89: 0 points - 90-109: 0 points - 110-119: 1 point - 120-129: 2 points - 130-139: 3 points - 140-149: 4 points - 150-159: 5 points - 160-169: 6 points - 170-179: 7 points - 180-189: 8 points - 190-199: 9 points - 200+: 10 points - For a heart rate of 95 bpm, the score is 0 points. 4. **Respiratory Rate:** - The patient has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. - From the APACHE II scoring table for Respiratory Rate: - < 5: 4 points - 5-6: 3 points - 7-10: 2 points - 11-20: 1 point - 21-24: 2 points - 25-29: 3 points - 30-39: 4 points - 40-49: 5 points - 50-59: 6 points - 60+: 7 points - For a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, the score is 1 point. 5. **PaO2/FiO2 ratio:** - We have the A-a gradient of 364 and FiO2 of 55% (0.55). - To calculate PaO2/FiO2, we need PaO2. The A-a gradient is given by the formula: A-a gradient = PaO2 - PaO2 (alveolar). - The alveolar air equation is: PaO2 (alveolar) = FiO2 * (PB - PH2O) - PaCO2 / RQ. - Let's assume a standard atmospheric pressure (PB) of 760 mm Hg and a water vapor pressure (PH2O) of 47 mm Hg. - Let's also assume a respiratory quotient (RQ) of 0.8 and a PaCO2 value. Since PaCO2 is not provided, we will have to make an assumption or use another approach. However, an alternative approach is to use the relationship between PaO2 and the A-a gradient. The A-a gradient is given by: A-a gradient = Measured PaO2 - Calculated PaO2. If we denote the measured PaO2 as PaO2_m and the calculated PaO2 as PaO2_c, then: A-a gradient = PaO2_c - PaO2_m. Given A-a gradient = 364 mm Hg and FiO2 = 0.55. To find PaO2_m, we need to calculate PaO2_c using the alveolar air equation: PaO2_c = FiO2 * (PB - PH2O) - PaCO2 / RQ. Let's assume a normal PaCO2 of 40 mm Hg and RQ = 0.8. PaO2_c = 0.55 * (760 - 47) - 40 / 0.8 PaO2_c = 0.55 * 713 - 50 PaO2_c = 392.15 - 50 = 342.15 mm Hg. Now, using the A-a gradient: A-a gradient = PaO2_c - PaO2_m 364 = 342.15 - PaO2_m This gives us: PaO2_m = 342.15 - 364 = -21.85 mm Hg. This result is not possible because PaO2 cannot be negative. It seems there might be an issue with the given A-a gradient value or the assumptions made. Let's try another approach. If we use the given information that the patient is on supplemental oxygen with FiO2 = 55%, and we assume a typical PaO2 value for someone on this level of oxygen support. Let's assume a PaO2 value that is consistent with the patient being on supplemental oxygen and having respiratory distress. If we assume a PaO2 of, say, 60 mm Hg (a value indicative of hypoxemia), then: PaO2/FiO2 = 60 / 0.55 ≈ 109.09.

Now, let's sum up the scores we have calculated for the variables we have data for: - GCS: 1 point - MAP: 0 points - Heart Rate: 0 points - Respiratory Rate: 1 point - PaO2/FiO2: 1 point - pH: 2 points - Temperature: 0 points - WBC: 1 point - Sodium: 1 point - Potassium: 0 points - Creatinine: 5 points Total score for the variables we have data for = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 12 points. We are missing the score for PaCO2. If we assume a normal PaCO2 (say, within the range of 35-45 mm Hg), the score for PaCO2 would be 0 points. So, if we add the PaCO2 score as 0 points, the total APS would be 12 + 0 = 12 points. Step 3: Calculate the Age Points. The patient is 60 years old. From the APACHE II scoring table for age: - 16-44 years: 0 points - 45-54 years: 1 point - 55-64 years: 2 points - 65-74 years: 3 points - 75-84 years: 4 points - 85+ years: 5 points For a 60-year-old patient, the age points are 2 points. Step 4: Calculate the Chronic Health Points. The patient has a history of liver failure and immunocompromise. According to the APACHE II scoring system, chronic health conditions such as liver failure and immunocompromise can contribute to chronic health points. For chronic health conditions, the APACHE II scoring system assigns points as follows: - No chronic health condition: 0 points - Chronic health condition: 1 point Since the patient has liver failure and is immunocompromised, we can assign 1 point for chronic health conditions. Step 5: Calculate the Total APACHE II Score. The total APACHE II score is the sum of the Acute Physiology Score (APS), Age Points, and Chronic Health Points. Total APACHE II score = APS + Age Points + Chronic Health Points If we use the APS we calculated (12 points), Age Points (2 points), and Chronic Health Points (1 point): Total APACHE II score = 12 + 2 + 1 = 15. So the APACHE II score is 15. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score, we need to evaluate the Acute Physiology Score (APS), Age Points, and Chronic Health Points. We have the following data from the patient note: - GCS: 14 - Blood Pressure: 135/75 mm Hg (MAP = 95 mm Hg) - Heart Rate: 95 bpm - Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute - pH: 7.32 - Temperature: 37.2°C - WBC: 12,000 per µL - Sodium: 138 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L - Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL - FiO2: 55%, and A-a gradient of 364. We calculated the scores for each variable as follows: - GCS: 1 point - MAP: 0 points - Heart Rate: 0 points - Respiratory Rate: 1 point - PaO2/FiO2: Assuming PaO2 = 60 mm Hg, PaO2/FiO2 = 109.09, which gives a score of 1 point. - pH: 2 points - Temperature: 0 points - WBC: 1 point - Sodium: 1 point - Potassium: 0 points - Creatinine: 5 points Total APS from these variables = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 12 points. For PaCO2, since it's not provided, we assumed a normal value, giving it a score of 0 points. Thus, the total APS is 12 + 0 = 12 points. For Age Points: The patient is 60 years old, so the age points are 2 points. For Chronic Health Points: The patient has liver failure and is immunocompromised, so the chronic health points are 1 point. Adding these

Provide answer.</think> The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Convert the patient's height from inches to meters. - The height is 77 inches. - 1 inch = 0.0254 meters. - Therefore, 77 inches = 77 * 0.0254 meters. - 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. 2. Use the formula for weight based on BMI: Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height in meters)^2. - The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. - The height in meters is 1.9558 m. - First, calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2. - (1.9558)^2 ≈ 3.825 m^2. 3. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight. - Target weight = 19.7 * 3.825. - Let's do the multiplication step by step. - 19.7 * 3.825 = 19.7 * (3.8 + 0.025). - 19.7 * 3.8 = (19.7 * 38) / 10. - 19.7 * 38 = 748.6. - So, 19.7 * 3.8 = 748.6 / 10 = 74.86. - Now calculate 19.7 * 0.025. - 19.7 * 0.025 = (19.7 * 25) / 1000. - 19.7 * 25 = 492.5. - So, 19.7 * 0.025 = 492.5 / 1000 = 0.4925. - Add the two results together: 74.86 + 0.4925 = 75.3525. Therefore, the target weight is approximately 75.35 kg. Rounding to a reasonable precision, the target weight is about 75.4 kg. So the final answer is 75.4 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the formula: Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height in meters)^2. The patient's height is 77 inches. First, convert the height from inches to meters. Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, the height in meters is 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Next, we need to calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2 ≈ 3.825 m^2. The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight: 19.7 * 3.825. Let's calculate this step by step. 19.7 * 3.825 = 19.7 * 3.8 + 19.7 * 0.025. First, calculate 19.7 * 3.8: 19.7 * 38 / 10 = 748.6 / 10 = 74.86. Next, calculate 19.7 * 0.025: 19.7 * 25 / 1000 = 492.5 / 1000 = 0.4925. Adding these two results together: 74.86 + 0.4925 = 75.3525.

Provide answer.", 'LLM Explanation': '1. Convert height from inches to meters: 77 in × 0.0254 m/in = 1.9558 m.\\n2. Square the height: 1.9558² ≈ 3.825 m².\\n3.

Round to a reasonable precision: about 75.4 kg.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '75.4', 'Target Explanation': "To find the target weight, we use the formula: Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height in meters)^2. The patient's height is 77 inches. First, convert the height from inches to meters. Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, the height in meters is 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Next, we need to calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2 ≈ 3.825 m^2. The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight: 19.7 * 3.825. Let's calculate this step by step. 19.7 * 3.825 = 19.7 * 3.8 + 19.7 * 0.025. First, calculate 19.7 * 3.8: 19.7 * 38 / 10 = 748.6 / 10 = 74.86. Next, calculate 19.7 * 0.025: 19.7 * 25 / 1000 = 492.5 / 1000 = 0.4925. Adding these two results together: 74.86 + 0.4925 = 75.3525.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

So GFR ~5 mL/min/1.73.</think> However, it seems that the creatinine value is given in mg/dL, and the CKD-EPI equation requires creatinine in μmol/L for the formula to be applied directly. Let's convert the creatinine from mg/dL to μmol/L. 1 mg/dL of creatinine is approximately equal to 88.4 μmol/L. So, 8.9 mg/dL = 8.9 * 88.4 = 786.76 μmol/L. Now we will use the CKD-EPI equation for creatinine in μmol/L for females: The CKD-EPI equation for GFR in mL/min/1.73 m² is: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}\right)^{\alpha} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] where: - Scr is the serum creatinine concentration in μmol/L. - For females, κ = 0.7, and α = -0.329 if Scr ≤ 0.7 mg/dL (or 61.9 μmol/L), and α = -1.209 if Scr > 0.7 mg/dL (or 61.9 μmol/L). Since 786.76 μmol/L is much greater than 61.9 μmol/L, we use the formula for Scr > 0.7 mg/dL: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right)\right)^{-0.329} \times \left(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right)\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] Let's calculate this step by step. 1. Calculate $\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}$: \[ \frac{786.76}{0.7} = 1123.94 \] Since 1123.94 is greater than 1, \[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right) = 1 \] and \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right) = 1123.94. \] Now plug these into the formula: \[ GFR = 144 \times (1)^{-0.329} \times (1123.94)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{38}. \] Since $(1)^{-0.329} = 1,$ we have \[ GFR = 144 \times (1123.94)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{38}. \] Now calculate $(1123.94)^{-1.209}.$ Take the natural logarithm: \[ \ln \left[(1123.94)^{-1.209}\right] = -1.209 \times \ln(1123.94). \] Compute $\ln(1123.94):$ \[ \ln(1123.94) \approx 7.024. \] So, \[ -1.209 \times 7.024 \approx -8.49. \] Now take the exponential to get back to the original value: \[ (1123.94)^{-1.209} \approx e^{-8.49} \approx 0.00018. \] Next, calculate $0.993^{38}.$ Take the natural logarithm: \[ \ln \left[0.993^{38}\right] = 38 \times \ln(0.993). \] Compute $\ln(0.993):$ \[ \ln(0.993) \approx -0.00703. \] So, \[ 38 \times (-0.00703) \approx -0.267. \] Now take the exponential to get back to the original value: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx e^{-0.267} \approx 0.766. \] Now plug these values back into the GFR formula: \[ GFR = 144 \times 0.00018 \times 0.766. \] Calculate $0.00018 \times 0.766:$ \[ 0.00018 \times 0.766 \approx 0.000138. \] Now multiply by 144: \[ GFR \approx 144 \times 0.000138 \approx 0.02. \] Thus the GFR is approximately 0.02 mL/min/1.73 m². This result seems very low and suggests that the patient has severe kidney dysfunction, which aligns with the clinical context given the high serum creatinine level. So the final answer is approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m² (as calculated earlier using the mg/dL conversion and the CKD-EPI formula). Thus the final answer is approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need the patient's serum creatinine level, age, and sex. The serum creatinine level is given as 8.9 mg/dL, the patient's age is 38 years, and the patient is female. The CKD-EPI equation for GFR in mL/min/1.73 m² is given by: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)\right)^{\alpha} \times \left(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] where Scr is the serum creatinine in mg/dL, κ = 0.7 for females, and α = -0.329. Let's break this down step by step. 1. Convert the serum creatinine from mg/dL to μmol/L for the CKD-EPI equation. \[ 8.9 \, \text{mg/dL} \times 88.4 \, \mu \text{mol/L per mg/dL} = 786.76 \, \mu \text{mol/L}. \] However, since the CKD-EPI equation can also be used directly with creatinine in mg/dL for females, we will use the mg/dL version of the formula. The formula for females is: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right)\right)^{-0.329} \times \left(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right)\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}}. \] Now, let's calculate each part. 2. Calculate $\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}$: \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714. \] Since 12.714 > 1, \[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right) = 1, \] and \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{0.7}, 1\right) = 12.714. \] Now plug these into the formula: \[ GFR = 144 \times (1)^{-0.329} \times (12.714)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{38}. \] Since $(1)^{-0.329} = 1,$ we have \[ GFR = 144 \times (12.714)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{38}. \] Next, calculate $(12.714)^{-1.209}.$ Take the natural logarithm: \[ \ln \left[(12.714)^{-1.209}\right] = -1.209 \times \ln(12.714). \] Compute $\ln(12.714):$ \[ \ln(12.714) \approx 2.543. \] So, \[ -1.209 \times 2.543 \approx -3.075. \] Now take the exponential to get back to the original value: \[ (12.714)^{-1.209} \approx e^{-3.075} \approx 0.046. \] Next, calculate $0.993^{38}.$ Take the natural logarithm: \[ \ln \left[0.993^{38}\right] = 38 \times \ln(0.993). \] Compute $\ln(0.993):$ \[ \ln(0.993) \approx -0.00703. \] So, \[ 38 \times (-0.00703) \approx -0.267. \] Now take the exponential to get back to the original value: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx e^{-0.267} \approx 0.766. \] Now plug these values back into the GFR formula: \[ GFR = 144 \times 0.046 \times 0.766. \] Calculate $0.046 \times 0.766:$ \[ 0.046 \times 0.766 \approx 0.0352. \] Now multiply by 144: \[ GFR \approx 144 \times 0.0352 \approx 5.05. \] Thus the GFR is approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "5"} So the final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need the patient's serum creatinine level, age, and sex. The serum creatinine level is given as 8.9 mg/dL, the patient's age is 38 years, and the patient is female. The CKD-EPI equation for GFR in mL/min/1.73 m² is given by: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)\right)^{\alpha} \times \left(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] where Scr is the serum creatinine in mg/dL, κ = 0.7 for females, and α = -0.329.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.", 'Question': "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '5.0', 'LLM Raw Thinking': "Need creatinine 8.9 mg/dL, age 38, female.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints. The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma (). Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer. Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis.

So score likely 0. Provide answer 0.</think> But let's approach this systematically. Step 1: Identify the FeverPAIN score components. The FeverPAIN score is used to predict the likelihood of Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat). The components of the FeverPAIN score are: - Fever (temperature ≥ 38°C or 100.4°F) - Ear pain - Absence of cough - Swollen or tender anterior cervical lymph nodes - Short course of illness (< 4 days) However, it seems there might be some confusion. Let's use the components that are typically used for scoring sore throat conditions. Step 2: Analyze the patient's symptoms and information provided in the note. The patient's symptoms and information from the note include: - The patient is a 77-year-old male. - He accidentally ingested 150 mL of 35% hydrogen peroxide. - Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, burning sensation in the mouth and throat, and some blood in the vomitus. - Physical examination findings: No acute distress, elevated blood pressure (157/84 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, arterial oxygen saturation 98% on room air. - No posterior oropharyngeal erythema. - Laboratory results: Elevated leukocyte count (18.9 × 10^3 K/mm3), elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL), elevated lipase (844 U/L), and hemoglobin of 16.4 g/dL. - Imaging: CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air. Step 3: Evaluate the FeverPAIN score components based on the given information. Let's break down the FeverPAIN score components and see if they apply to this patient: 1. **Fever (≥38°C or 100.4°F):** - The note does not mention the patient's temperature. Therefore, we cannot determine if the patient has a fever. 2. **Ear pain:** - There is no mention of ear pain in the patient's symptoms. 3. **Absence of cough:** - The note does not mention any cough. 4. **Swollen or tender anterior cervical lymph nodes:** - The note does not mention any examination of the lymph nodes. 5. **Short course of illness (< 4 days):** - The patient presented immediately after the ingestion, so the duration of symptoms is very short (approximately 90 minutes). Since the patient's condition involves accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide and the symptoms are related to that ingestion (nausea, vomiting, burning sensation), it doesn't seem like the FeverPAIN score is directly applicable here because the FeverPAIN score is used for evaluating sore throat conditions, specifically for predicting strep throat. Given the context of the patient's condition (accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide), it seems inappropriate to calculate a FeverPAIN score for this case. Therefore, the FeverPAIN score is not applicable to this patient's condition. The answer is that the FeverPAIN score is not applicable. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The FeverPAIN score is used to predict the likelihood of Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat). The components include Fever (≥38°C), Ear pain, Absence of cough, Swollen or tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and Short course of illness (< 4 days). However, the patient's condition involves accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, presenting with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. This scenario does not fit the criteria for evaluating a sore throat using the FeverPAIN score. Therefore, the FeverPAIN score is not applicable to this patient's condition.", "answer": "Not applicable"} So the final JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "The FeverPAIN score is used to predict the likelihood of Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat).

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions. Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus. Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome. Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases. It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

Let's assume it's Hydromorphone since the task mentions "HYDROmorphone." - The patient takes 70 mg of Hydromorphone twice a day. - Conversion factor for Hydromorphone to MME is 4. - Daily dose of Hydromorphone = 70 mg * 2 (since it's taken twice a day) = 140 mg. - MME for Hydromorphone = 140 mg * 4 = 560 MME. 3. **Codeine**: The patient takes 10 mg of Codeine twice a day. - Conversion factor for Codeine to MME is 0.15. - Daily dose of Codeine = 10 mg * 2 (since it's taken twice a day) = 20 mg. - MME for Codeine = 20 mg * 0.15 = 3 MME. Now, we add up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME. Total MME = MME from Oxycodone + MME from Hydromorphone + MME from Codeine Total MME = 90 + 560 + 3 = 653 MME. So the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 653. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we will convert each medication to its MME using the appropriate conversion factors.\n\n1. For Oxycodone: The patient takes 60 mg once a day.\n - Conversion factor for Oxycodone to MME is 1.5.\n - Daily dose of Oxycodone = 60 mg.\n - MME for Oxycodone = 60 mg * 1.5 = 90 MME.\n\n2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} \times (\text{Age})^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \, (\text{if female}) \times 1.212 \, (\text{if black}) \] Given: - Serum Creatinine (Scr) = 8 mg/dL - Age = 73 years - The patient is female. - The patient is African American. Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step. Step 1: Calculate \((\text{Scr})^{-1.154}\). \[ (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} = 8^{-1.154} \] Using a calculator: \[ 8^{-1.154} \approx 0.0907 \] Step 2: Calculate \((\text{Age})^{-0.203}\). \[ (\text{Age})^{-0.203} = 73^{-0.203} \] Using a calculator: \[ 73^{-0.203} \approx 0.418 \] Step 3: Combine the constants and the calculated values. The MDRD equation becomes: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times 0.0907 \times 0.418 \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \] Now, let's multiply these step by step. First, multiply 175 by 0.0907: \[ 175 \times 0.0907 \approx 15.8725 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.418: \[ 15.8725 \times 0.418 \approx 6.63 \] Then, multiply the result by 0.742: \[ 6.63 \times 0.742 \approx 4.91 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.212: \[ 4.91 \times 1.212 \approx 5.95 \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 5.95 mL/min/1.73 m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation.

Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Normal albumin 4.0-5.0 g/dL. So 4.2 g/L is low? Actually 4.2 g/L is 0.42 g/dL, very low. Maybe misprint: albumin 4.2 g/L? Usually albumin 4.2 g/dL. Likely 4.2 g/dL. Use 4.2 g/dL. Then correction: (4 - albumin) = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2. So delta gap = AG - (4 - albumin) = 22 - (-0.2) = 22.2 mEq/L. Round maybe 22.2. Provide answer.

Therefore, the albumin-corrected anion gap is 22.5 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 16%|█▌        | 16/100 [29:44<1:40:39, 71.90s/it]

The heart rate (HR) is 164 bpm. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds. \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} = \frac{60}{164} \approx 0.36585 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc} = \text{QT} / \sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}. \] Here, the QT interval is 330 msec, and the RR interval is approximately 0.36585 seconds. Now, we need to calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt[3]{0.36585} \approx 0.715. \] Step 3: Plug the values into the Fridericia formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.715} \approx 461.54 \, \text{msec}. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 462 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 462 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

So answer 134.</think> But let's think about other factors that could affect sodium correction. The patient has a serum potassium of 5.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range (typically 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), and the glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is within the normal range (typically 70-110 mg/dL for fasting glucose). However, the patient has a low blood pressure (85/46 mm Hg), which suggests possible dehydration or other issues. The patient also has symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and gastrointestinal issues (loose stools and occasional abdominal pain and nausea), which could indicate some underlying condition. But the question specifically asks for the corrected sodium concentration. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 10 where the glucose is in mg/dL. Given the patient's glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is below 100 mg/dL, the correction term would be: (70 - 100) / 10 = -30 / 10 = -3 So the corrected sodium would be: Corrected Sodium = 134 + (-3) = 131 mEq/L But since the glucose is below 100 mg/dL, the formula doesn't apply in the typical sense because it's meant to correct for hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia. If glucose is below 100, the formula would actually decrease the sodium level, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's use the other formula for hyperglycemia correction: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + 1.6 * (Glucose - 100) / 100 Plugging in the values: Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * (70 - 100) / 100 Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * (-30) / 100 Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * -0.3 Corrected Sodium = 134 - 0.48 Corrected Sodium = 133.52 ≈ 134 mEq/L Since the glucose is below 100 mg/dL, the correction is very small and essentially negligible. Thus, the measured sodium of 134 mEq/L is already the corrected sodium. So the corrected sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we use the formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + 1.6 * (Glucose - 100) / 100.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?

THINKING USED We need to compute due date. LMP 02/03/2012. Cycle 28 days. Naegele: add 280 days (40 weeks). 02/03/2012 + 280 days. Let's calculate. 2012 is leap year. Feb 3 2012. Add 280 days. Let's compute: 2012-02-03 to 2012-12-31? Let's do month by month. Feb 2012: 29 days total. From Feb 3 to Feb 29 inclusive? Actually days remaining in Feb after Feb 3: Feb 3 to Feb 29 = 27 days (since Feb 3 is day 3, days 3-29 inclusive = 27). But easier: add 280 days. Let's compute using date arithmetic: 2012-02-03 + 280 days. We can compute by adding 280 days: 280 = 9 months (approx). Let's use known due date: LMP Feb 3 2012 -> due date around Nov 9 2012? Wait typical due date for LMP Feb 3 2012 would be Nov 9 2012 (since 280 days later). Let's verify: Feb 3 + 280 days = Nov 9 2012. Let's check: Feb 3 to Mar 3 = 28 days (since 2012 leap). Actually Feb 3 to Mar 3 = 28 days. Then to Apr 3 = 30 days? Wait months: Feb 3 to Mar 3 28 days. Mar 3 to Apr 3 31 days. Apr 3 to May 3 30 days. May 3 to Jun 3 31 days. Jun 3 to Jul 3 30 days. Jul 3 to Aug 3 31 days. Aug 3 to Sep 3 31 days. Sep 3 to Oct 3 30 days. Oct 3 to Nov 3 31 days. Sum: 28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31 = 273 days. Need 280, so add 7 more days: Nov 3 + 7 days = Nov 10. Wait we had 273 days to Nov 3. Add 7 days -> Nov 10. But earlier I thought Nov 9. Let's double-check. Let's compute more precisely: Use date addition: Feb 3 2012 + 280 days. We can compute by adding 280 days to Feb 3. Let's use day-of-year approach. 2012 is leap year. Day numbers: Jan 1 = 1. Feb 3 = 34? Jan 31 days + Feb 3 = 34. Add 280 days -> day 34+280=314. Day 314 of 2012. In leap year, day 314 corresponds to? Let's compute: Jan 31, Feb 29, Mar 31, Apr 30, May 31, Jun 30, Jul 31, Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 31, Nov 30, Dec 31. Cumulative days: Jan 31, Feb 60, Mar 91, Apr 121, May 152, Jun 182, Jul 213, Aug 244, Sep 274, Oct 305, Nov 335, Dec 366. Day 314 falls between Oct 305 and Nov 335. So day 314 - 305 = 9. So November 9. Wait day 314 is 9 days into November. So November 9. So due date is 11/09/2012. My earlier calculation gave Nov 10 due to miscount. Let's verify: 280 days after Feb 3 inclusive? Usually due date is 280 days after LMP, not inclusive. So Feb 3 + 280 days = Nov 9. So answer: 11/09/2012. Thus output JSON.

Wait we had 273 days to Nov 3. Add 7 days -> Nov 10. But earlier I thought Nov 9. Let's double-check. Let's compute more precisely: Use date addition: Feb 3 2012 + 280 days. We can compute by adding 280 days to Feb 3. Let's use day-of-year approach. 2012 is leap year. Day numbers: Jan 1 = 1. Feb 3 = 34? Jan 31 days + Feb 3 = 34. Add 280 days -> day 34+280=314. Day 314 of 2012. In leap year, day 314 corresponds to? Let's compute: Jan 31, Feb 29, Mar 31, Apr 30, May 31, Jun 30, Jul 31, Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 31, Nov 30, Dec 31.

So November 9. Wait day 314 is 9 days into November. So November 9. So due date is 11/09/2012. My earlier calculation gave Nov 10 due to miscount. Let's verify: 280 days after Feb 3 inclusive? Usually due date is 280 days after LMP, not inclusive. So Feb 3 + 280 days = Nov 9. So answer: 11/09/2012. Thus output JSON.</think>

Naegele's Rule states that the due date is 280 days (or 40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period. Here's the step-by-step calculation: 1. Start with the LMP: February 3, 2012. 2. Add 280 days to this date. Let's break this down systematically: - First, let's determine the number of days in each month from February 2012 onwards until we reach the total of 280 days. Since 2012 is a leap year, February has 29 days. We can add the days month by month: - From February 3, 2012, to February 29, 2012: 29 - 3 + 1 = 27 days (since February 3 to February 29 inclusive is 27 days). Now, we have used up 27 days out of the 280 days. We have 280 - 27 = 253 days left to add. - March has 31 days. Adding all of March: 31 days. Remaining days after March: 253 - 31 = 222 days. - April has 30 days. Adding all of April: 30 days. Remaining days after April: 222 - 30 = 192 days. - May has 31 days. Adding all of May: 31 days. Remaining days after May: 192 - 31 = 161 days. - June has 30 days. Adding all of June: 30 days. Remaining days after June: 161 - 30 = 131 days. - July has 31 days. Adding all of July: 31 days. Remaining days after July: 131 - 31 = 100 days. - August has 31 days. Adding all of August: 31 days. Remaining days after August: 100 - 31 = 69 days. - September has 30 days. Adding all of September: 30 days. Remaining days after September: 69 - 30 = 39 days. - October has 31 days. We need to add the remaining 39 days from October. Since we have 39 days left to add from October, and October has 31 days, we will use up all 31 days of October and have 39 - 31 = 8 days left. So, after October, we have 8 days left to add. These 8 days will be in November. Thus, starting from November 1, 2012, and adding 8 days, we get November 1 + 8 days = November 9, 2012. Therefore, the estimated due date is November 9, 2012, or 11/09/2012. So the estimated due date is 11/09/2012.", "answer": "11/09/2012"}

Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (which is approximately >176.8 µmol/L) Step 2: Evaluate each factor for the given patient: 1. **High-risk surgery**: The patient is scheduled for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which is considered high-risk surgery. This factor is present. 2. **History of ischemic heart disease (IHD)**: The patient has no history of chest pain or dyspnea, and there's no mention of IHD. This factor is not present. 3. **History of congestive heart failure (CHF)**: The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. This factor is not present. 4. **History of cerebrovascular disease**: The patient has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. This factor is present. 5. **Insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus**: The patient has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin. This factor is present. 6. **Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (which is approximately >176.8 µmol/L)**: The patient's creatinine level is 120 µmol/L. Since 120 µmol/L is less than 176.8 µmol/L, this factor is not present. Now, let's count the number of positive factors: - High-risk surgery: Present (1 point) - History of ischemic heart disease: Not present (0 points) - History of congestive heart failure: Not present (0 points) - History of cerebrovascular disease: Present (1 point) - Insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus: Present (1 point) - Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL: Not present (0 points) Adding up the points: 1 (high-risk surgery) + 1 (cerebrovascular disease) + 1 (insulin-requiring diabetes) = 3 points. Therefore, the patient's Cardiac Risk Index based on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Cardiac Risk Index using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), we need to evaluate the following factors: \n1.

This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 µmol. To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.014 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL.

Here's the breakdown: 1. **Age**: The patient is 75 years old. According to the PSI scoring system: - Age 75 years gives 75 points. 2. **Comorbidities**: - The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is considered a comorbidity. CHF gives 10 points. - No liver disease or neoplastic conditions are mentioned, so no additional points for these. 3. **Vital Signs and Lab Results**: - **Respiratory Rate**: 22 breaths per minute. A respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute gives 20 points. Since the respiratory rate is 22, it does not exceed 24, so it gives 0 points. - **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**: 27 mg/dL. The PSI scoring for BUN is: - BUN > 30 mg/dL gives 20 points. - BUN 20-30 mg/dL gives 10 points. - BUN < 20 mg/dL gives 0 points. Since BUN is 27 mg/dL, it falls in the range 20-30 mg/dL, so it gives 10 points. - **Sodium**: 139 mEq/L. Normal sodium levels (135-145 mEq/L) give 0 points. So, 0 points. - **Hematocrit**: 39%. The PSI scoring for hematocrit is: - Hematocrit < 30% gives 20 points. - Hematocrit 30-40% gives 10 points. - Hematocrit > 40% gives 0 points. Since the hematocrit is 39%, it falls in the range 30-40%, so it gives 10 points. - **Glucose**: 180 mg/dL. The PSI scoring for glucose is: - Glucose > 250 mg/dL gives 20 points. - Glucose 200-250 mg/dL gives 10 points. - Glucose < 200 mg/dL gives 0 points. Since glucose is 180 mg/dL, it is less than 200 mg/dL, so it gives 0 points. - **PaO2**: 80 mm Hg. The PSI scoring for PaO2 is: - PaO2 < 60 mm Hg gives 20 points. - PaO2 60-79 mm Hg gives 10 points. - PaO2 > 79 mm Hg gives 0 points. Since PaO2 is 80 mm Hg, it is greater than 79 mm Hg, so it gives 0 points. - **Temperature**: 36.5°C. Normal temperature is within the range, so it gives 0 points. - **Pulse Rate**: 82 beats per minute. The PSI scoring for pulse rate is: - Pulse rate > 120 beats per minute gives 20 points. - Pulse rate 100-120 beats per minute gives 10 points. - Pulse rate < 100 beats per minute gives 0 points. Since the pulse rate is 82 beats per minute, it is less than 100, so it gives 0 points. 4. **Chest X-ray Findings**: The chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. Pleural effusion gives 10 points. Now, let's sum up all the points: - Age: 75 points - CHF: 10 points - Respiratory Rate: 0 points - BUN: 10 points - Sodium: 0 points - Hematocrit: 10 points - Glucose: 0 points - PaO2: 0 points - Temperature: 0 points - Pulse Rate: 0 points - Pleural Effusion: 10 points Total Score = 75 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 115 points. The PSI class is determined based on the total score: - Class I: 0-50 points - Class II: 51-90 points - Class III: 91-130 points - Class IV: 131-170 points - Class V: >170 points Since the total score is 115, it falls into Class III (91-130 points). It seems I made an error in the respiratory rate scoring. Let's correct it. The respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. The PSI scoring for respiratory rate is: - Respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute gives 20 points. - Respiratory rate 20-24 breaths per minute gives 10 points. - Respiratory rate < 20 breaths per minute gives 0 points. Since the respiratory rate is 22, it falls in the range 20-24 breaths per minute, so it gives 10 points. Let's recalculate the total score with the corrected respiratory rate: Total Score = 75 (Age) + 10 (CHF) + 10 (Respiratory Rate) + 10 (BUN) + 0 (Sodium) + 10 (Hematocrit) + 0 (Glucose) + 0 (PaO2) + 0 (Temperature) + 0 (Pulse Rate) + 10 (Pleural Effusion) = 125 points. Now the total score is 125 points. This falls into Class IV (131-170 points), but actually it should be between the classes. Let's check the PSI classes again: - Class I: 0-34 points - Class II: 35-74 points - Class III: 75-114 points - Class IV: 115-154 points - Class V: >154 points So, a score of 125 falls into Class IV (115-154 points). Thus the total score is 125. The PSI class for a score of 125 is Class IV. However, the question asks for the PSI score, not the class. So the total PSI score is 125. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to evaluate the patient's characteristics and lab results according to the PSI scoring system.

Since the respiratory rate is 22, it falls in the range 20-24 breaths per minute, so it gives 10 points. - **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**: 27 mg/dL. The PSI scoring for BUN is: - BUN > 30 mg/dL gives 20 points. - BUN 20-30 mg/dL gives 10 points. - BUN < 20 mg/dL gives 0 points. Since BUN is 27 mg/dL, it falls in the range 20-30 mg/dL, so it gives 10 points. - **Sodium**: 139 mEq/L. Normal sodium levels (135-145 mEq/L) give 0 points. So, 0 points. - **Hematocrit**: 39%. The PSI scoring for hematocrit is: - Hematocrit < 30% gives 20 points. - Hematocrit 30-40% gives 10 points. - Hematocrit > 40% gives 0 points. Since the hematocrit is 39%, it falls in the range 30-40%, so it gives 10 points. - **Glucose**: 180 mg/dL. The PSI scoring for glucose is: - Glucose > 250 mg/dL gives 20 points. - Glucose 200-250 mg/dL gives 10 points. - Glucose < 200 mg/dL gives 0 points. Since glucose is 180 mg/dL, it is less than 200 mg/dL, so it gives 0 points. - **PaO2**: 80 mm Hg. The PSI scoring for PaO2 is: - PaO2 < 60 mm Hg gives 20 points. - PaO2 60-79 mm Hg gives 10 points. - PaO2 > 79 mm Hg gives 0 points. Since PaO2 is 80 mm Hg, it is greater than 79 mm Hg, so it gives 0 points. - **Temperature**: 36.5°C. Normal temperature is within the range, so it gives 0 points. - **Pulse Rate**: 82 beats per minute. The PSI scoring for pulse rate is: - Pulse rate > 120 beats per minute gives 20 points. - Pulse rate 100-120 beats per minute gives 10 points. - Pulse rate < 100 beats per minute gives 0 points. Since the pulse rate is 82 beats per minute, it is less than 100, so it gives 0 points. 4. **Chest X-ray Findings**: The chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. Pleural effusion gives 10 points. Now, let's sum up all the points: - Age: 75 points - CHF: 10 points - Respiratory Rate: 10 points - BUN: 10 points - Sodium: 0 points - Hematocrit: 10 points - Glucose: 0 points - PaO2: 0 points - Temperature: 0 points - Pulse Rate: 0 points - Pleural Effusion: 10 points Total Score = 75 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 125 points. Thus the total PSI score is 125. ", 'Ground Truth Answer': '95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 75.0 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75.0 = 75.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75.0 - 10 = 65.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 10 = 85.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85.0 + 10 = 95.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 82.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 95.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 22%|██▏       | 22/100 [39:34<2:27:59, 113.83s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.

His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.

Might be 0.56. Let's output.</think> But it seems I am not sure about the term "albumin corrected delta ratio." Let's approach this step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the given data: - Albumin: 3.8 g/dL - Creatinine: 10.48 mg/dL Step 2: Calculate the albumin-corrected creatinine. The formula for albumin-corrected creatinine is: Corrected Creatinine = Measured Creatinine * (Normal Albumin / Patient's Albumin) The normal albumin level is typically around 4.0 g/dL. So, the corrected creatinine is: Corrected Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 10.48 * 1.0526 = 11.04 mg/dL Step 3: Calculate the "delta" part. The term "delta ratio" likely refers to the difference between the corrected creatinine and the measured creatinine. Delta Creatinine = Corrected Creatinine - Measured Creatinine Delta Creatinine = 11.04 - 10.48 = 0.56 mg/dL Thus, the "albumin-corrected delta ratio" could be interpreted as the difference between the corrected creatinine and the measured creatinine, which is 0.56 mg/dL. So the answer is 0.56. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta ratio, we first need to calculate the albumin-corrected creatinine. The formula for albumin-corrected creatinine is: Corrected Creatinine = Measured Creatinine * (Normal Albumin / Patient's Albumin). Given the measured creatinine is 10.48 mg/dL and the patient's albumin is 3.8 g/dL, and assuming the normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL, we get: Corrected Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 10.48 * 1.0526 = 11.04 mg/dL. The delta part refers to the difference between the corrected creatinine and the measured creatinine. So, Delta Creatinine = Corrected Creatinine - Measured Creatinine = 11.04 - 10.48 = 0.56 mg/dL. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is 0.56.", "answer": "0.56"}

Given the measured creatinine is 10.48 mg/dL and the patient's albumin is 3.8 g/dL, and assuming the normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL, we get: Corrected Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 10.48 * 1.0526 = 11.04 mg/dL. The delta part refers to the difference between the corrected creatinine and the measured creatinine. So, Delta Creatinine = Corrected Creatinine - Measured Creatinine = 11.04 - 10.48 = 0.56 mg/dL. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is 0.56.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.25', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.8 (in g/dL)) = 12.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.5 - 12 = 0.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.5 mEq/L / 2.0 mEq/L = 0.25. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.25.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 24%|██▍       | 24/100 [41:32<1:46:47, 84.30s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.
The patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.

This is greater than 38.5°C. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **Pain (sore throat)**: The patient has symptoms such as drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, and inability to eat solids. These symptoms suggest significant throat discomfort or pain. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 3. **Unable to eat**: The patient is unable to eat solids. This indicates difficulty in eating. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 4. **Age > 12 years**: The patient is 3 years old. This criterion is not met since the age is not greater than 12 years. Score = 0. 5. **White blood cell count > 10,000/µL**: The patient's white blood cell count is 14.2 × 10^3/µL (or 14.2 × 10^9/L), which is greater than 10,000/µL. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. Now, we add up the scores from each criterion: - Fever > 38.5°C: 1 - Pain (sore throat): 1 - Unable to eat: 1 - Age > 12 years: 0 - White blood cell count > 10,000/µL: 1 Total score = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

Score = 0. - **Hypertension**: The patient has a history of arterial hypertension. Score = 1. - **Age**: The patient is 83 years old. Since the patient is over 75 years old, this component scores 2 points. Score = 2. - **Diabetes mellitus**: The patient has diabetes. Score = 1. - **Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism**: No prior stroke or TIA is mentioned. Score = 0. - **Vascular disease**: No specific mention of vascular disease. Score = 0. - **Age 65-74 years**: Not applicable since the patient is 83 years old. Score = 0. - **Sex category (female)**: The patient is male. Therefore, this component does not apply. Score = 0. Now, let's add up the scores: - Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction: 0 - Hypertension: 1 - Age ≥ 75 years: 2 - Diabetes mellitus: 1 - Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism: 0 - Vascular disease: 0 - Age 65-74 years: 0 - Sex category (female): 0 Total CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4. So the CHA2DS2-VASc score for this patient is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the patient, we will evaluate each component of the score based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n- C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction): Not mentioned. Score = 0.\n- H (Hypertension): The patient has a history of arterial hypertension. Score = 1.\n- A2 (Age ≥ 75 years): The patient is 83 years old, which falls into the age ≥ 75 category. Score = 2.\n- D (Diabetes mellitus): The patient has diabetes. Score = 1.\n- S2 (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism): No prior stroke or TIA is mentioned. Score = 0.\n- V (Vascular disease): No specific mention of vascular disease. Score = 0.\n- A (Age 65-74 years): Not applicable since the patient is 83 years old.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

So answer ~0.0003.</think> But this seems incorrect because the FIB-4 index is typically used for adults and the age is too young for this index to be meaningful. Let's use the data from the time of liver biopsy for the FIB-4 calculation since that's when the liver function tests were taken. From the text: "Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L." And the age at the time of the liver biopsy is approximately 3 years old. Let's calculate the FIB-4 index using the data from the time of the liver biopsy. The formula for FIB-4 is: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{\text{(Age} \times \text{AST)}}{\text{(Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}})} \] From the text, the platelet count before the biopsy was 101000 /mcL. AST = 677 IU/L ALT = 1094 IU/L Age = 3 years Now let's plug in the values: 1. Calculate the numerator: Age * AST = 3 * 677 = 2031 2. Calculate the denominator: Platelet count * sqrt(ALT) = 101000 * sqrt(1094) The square root of 1094 is approximately 33.0757. So the denominator is: 101000 * 33.0757 ≈ 3,340,645.7 Now, calculate the FIB-4 index: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{2031}{3,340,645.7} \approx 0.000608 \] This is a very small number, which suggests that the FIB-4 index is not meaningful for such a young child. However, if we use the data from the time when the patient was diagnosed with AIH and the liver biopsy was performed, the values are: AST = 547 IU/L ALT = 600 IU/L Age = 3 years (approximately) Platelet count = 101000 /mcL Let's calculate the FIB-4 index using these values: Numerator: Age * AST = 3 * 547 = 1641 Denominator: Platelet count * sqrt(ALT) = 101000 * sqrt(600) The square root of 600 is approximately 24.4949. So the denominator is: 101000 * 24.4949 ≈ 2,474,000 Now, calculate the FIB-4 index: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{1641}{2,474,000} \approx 0.000663 \] This is also a very small number. Given the context and the fact that the FIB-4 index is typically used for adults and not for children, especially those under the age of 18, the FIB-4 index is not appropriate for this patient. So the answer is not meaningful in the context of this patient's age. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FIB-4 index, we use the formula: (Age * AST) / (Platelet count * sqrt(ALT)).

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time.

(Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.\nOne year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.\nLiver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.\nDuring her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.', 'Question': "What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.169', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 87.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 104.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 101000.0 count/µL. To convert 101000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 101000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 101000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 101000000000.0/(10^9) = 101.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (2 * 87.0)/(101.0 * sqrt(104.0)) = 0.169.\nHence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 0.169.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those on anticoagulation therapy. The components of the HAS-BLED score are: - H: Hypertension (systolic BP >160 mmHg or diastolic BP >100 mmHg) - A: Abnormal renal/liver function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation) - E: Elderly (age >65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension**: The patient has a documented history of hypertension. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function**: - The patient has a kidney transplant and confirmed renal disease, which indicates abnormal renal function. - Additionally, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis, indicating abnormal liver function. Since both renal and liver abnormalities are present, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 3. **S: Stroke**: The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) of the brain last year. A TIA is considered a stroke history for the purposes of the HAS-BLED score. Score = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition**: The patient denies any major bleeding episodes or known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. There is no evidence of a bleeding history or predisposition. Score = 0. 5. **L: Labile INR**: The patient's coagulation studies show a stable INR. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (age > 65 years)**: The patient is 22 years old. This criterion is not met. Score = 0. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly**: The patient admits to drinking more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. This indicates excessive alcohol consumption. Score = 1. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal renal/liver function): 1 - S (Stroke): 1 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly): 0 - D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly): 1 Adding these scores together: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4.

Round maybe 498 ms.</think> To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the given values. - The patient's heart rate (HR) is 136 bpm. - The QT interval is 330 msec. Step 2: Calculate the RR interval in seconds. The RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute, converted to seconds. The formula is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] So, \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{136} \approx 0.4412 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 3: Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Bazett formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] Plugging in the values we have: \[ \text{QT} = 330 \, \text{msec}, \] \[ \text{RR} \approx 0.4412 \, \text{seconds}, \] we get \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.4412} \approx 0.6642. \] Now, we can calculate the QTc: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.56 \, \text{msec}. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 497 msec. So the patient's corrected QT interval is approximately 497 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

The given values are: - Serum creatinine (Scr) = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - Gender = Female - Race = African American Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step. The MDRD equation is: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Scr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \] where: - Scr = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - The factor for being female is 0.742 - The factor for being African American is 1.212 Step 1: Calculate \((Scr)^{-1.154}\). \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \] Using logarithms to simplify this: \[ \log_{10}(14.6^{-1.154}) = -1.154 \times \log_{10}(14.6) \] We know that \(\log_{10}(14.6) \approx 1.164\).

First, multiply \(175 \times 0.045\): \[ 175 \times 0.045 = 7.875 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.514: \[ 7.875 \times 0.514 \approx 4.056 \] Then, multiply by 0.742: \[ 4.056 \times 0.742 \approx 3.007 \] Finally, multiply by 1.212: \[ 3.007 \times 1.212 \approx 3.645 \] So the GFR is approximately 3.645 mL/min/1.73 m².

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg).

The correct formula for the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is actually not the one I used. The Hodges formula is not a standard formula for correcting the QT interval. The most commonly used formulas for correcting the QT interval are the Bazett's formula, Fridericia's formula, and the Framingham formula. However, since the task seems to be asking for the Hodges formula and I couldn't find a standard Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval, I will assume that the task might have a mistake or is referring to a less common formula. Let's use the Bazett's formula for the corrected QT interval as a common approach. The Bazett's formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where the RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate (HR). The heart rate is given in beats per minute (bpm), and the RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG, typically measured in seconds. The relationship between the heart rate (HR) and the RR interval is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} \] Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec First, calculate the RR interval: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{154} \approx 0.3896 \, \text{seconds} \] Now, apply the Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3896}} \] Calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{0.3896} \approx 0.6242 \] Now, plug this into the Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6242} \approx 528.7 \, \text{msec} \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 529 msec. However, since the task specifically mentions the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, let's assume the task might be referring to a different formula or there might be a mistake. Let's try another common formula, the Fridericia's formula: The Fridericia's formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Fridericia} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\text{RR}^{1/3}} \] Using the same RR interval we calculated earlier: \[ \text{RR} \approx 0.3896 \, \text{seconds} \] Now, calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \text{RR}^{1/3} = (0.3896)^{1/3} \approx 0.7303 \] Now, apply the Fridericia's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Fridericia} = \frac{330}{0.7303} \approx 452.0 \, \text{msec} \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 452 msec. Since the task specifically asks for the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, I will assume that the task might have a mistake or is referring to a less common formula. Let's try the Framingham formula as another approach: The Framingham formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times (\text{HR} - 60) \] Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec Now, calculate the term $(\text{HR} - 60)$: \[ \text{HR} - 60 = 154 - 60 = 94 \] Now, plug this into the Framingham formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = 330 + 0.154 \times 94 \] Calculate $0.154 \times 94$: \[ 0.154 \times 94 = 14.476 \] Now, add this to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = 330 + 14.476 \approx 344.476 \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 344 msec. Since the task specifies the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, I will assume that the task might be referring to the Framingham formula or another similar formula. Let's try the Hodges formula as it might be a less common formula. The Hodges formula is not a standard formula, but if we assume it is a formula similar to the Framingham formula, let's use the Framingham formula as the closest approximation. So the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is approximately 344 msec. Thus the answer is 344 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula, I first tried to use the Bazett's and Fridericia's formulas since I couldn't find a standard Hodges formula.

First, calculate $(\text{HR} - 60) = 154 - 60 = 94$. Then, calculate $0.154 \times 94 = 14.476$. Adding this to the QT interval gives: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = 330 + 14.476 \approx 344.476. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 344 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

Here is the task:
Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

Convert to mg/dL? 1 mmol/L Ca = 2.5 mg/dL. So 0.93 mmol/L = 0.93*2.5 = 2.325 mg/dL. That's ionized. But total calcium likely low. We need total Ca value. Not provided. Maybe use ionized? But formula uses total Ca. We don't have. Could approximate using ionized? Might be trick: use ionized as total? Probably use ionized as total. Then corrected = 2.325 + 0.8*(4-2.8)=2.325+0.8*1.2=2.325+0.96=3.285 mg/dL. So answer 3.29 mg/dL.

He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.\nConcurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.', 'Question': "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED Need delta gap: (Bicarbonate - 24) - (Serum Na - Serum Cl). Use admission values? likely at presentation: bicarbonate 29, Na 141, Cl 104. Delta gap = (29-24) - (141-104)=5 - 37 = -32 mEq/L. But delta gap negative? maybe use later values: bicarbonate 22, Na 134, Cl 104. Then (22-24)= -2; (134-104)=30; delta = -2 -30 = -32 again. So answer -32.

Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise. Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night. Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation. Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.

So answer -32.</think> But let's calculate the anion gap first and then the delta gap. The anion gap is calculated as: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]) Let's use the values from the patient's admission to our Children's Hospital: - Serum Na = 134 mEq/L - Serum Cl = 104 mEq/L - Serum HCO3 (bicarbonate) = 22 mEq/L Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]) = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L The normal anion gap is typically between 8-16 mEq/L. So the anion gap here is within the normal range. Now, the delta gap is calculated as: Delta Gap = Anion Gap - (Normal Anion Gap - Bicarbonate Deficit) But another common way to calculate the delta gap is: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap) - (Serum Bicarbonate - Normal Bicarbonate) Let's use the formula: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - (24 - Serum Bicarbonate) where the normal anion gap is taken as 12 mEq/L and the normal bicarbonate level is taken as 24 mEq/L. Using the values from the admission to the Children's Hospital: - Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L - Serum Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L Now, let's plug these into the formula: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - (24 - Serum Bicarbonate) Delta Gap = (8 - 12) - (24 - 22) Delta Gap = -4 - 2 Delta Gap = -6 mEq/L So the delta gap is -6 mEq/L. But let's also calculate the delta gap using the formula: Delta Gap = (Bicarbonate - 24) - (Serum Na - Serum Cl - 14) Using the values from the admission to the Children's Hospital: - Serum Na = 134 mEq/L - Serum Cl = 104 mEq/L - Serum Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L Now, let's calculate it step by step: 1. Calculate Serum Na - Serum Cl - 14: Serum Na - Serum Cl = 134 - 104 = 30 Now subtract 14 from this: 30 - 14 = 16 2. Now calculate Bicarbonate - 24: Bicarbonate - 24 = 22 - 24 = -2 Now, the delta gap is: Delta Gap = (Bicarbonate - 24) - (Serum Na - Serum Cl - 14) = -2 - 16 = -18 So the delta gap is -18 mEq/L. It seems there are different ways to calculate the delta gap, and the results vary. Let's use the first method I calculated (using the formula Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - (24 - Serum Bicarbonate)) which gave us -6 mEq/L. So the final answer is -6 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, we need to use the given formula and the patient's laboratory values. We will use the values from the patient's admission to the Children's Hospital: Na = 134 mEq/L, Cl = 104 mEq/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3) = 22 mEq/L.\n\nFirst, calculate the anion gap:\nAnion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]) = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the delta gap: \nDelta Gap = (Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap) - (Normal Bicarbonate - Serum Bicarbonate).\n\nThe normal anion gap is typically around 12 mEq/L, and the normal bicarbonate level is 24 mEq/L.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nDelta Gap = (8 - 12) - (24 - 22) = -4 - 2 = -6 mEq/L.\n\nThus, the delta gap is -6 mEq/L.", "answer": "-6"}

A 19-year-old male with a past medical history of surgical repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament and seasonal allergies presents to the emergency department with a rash. He reports that he first noticed the rash on his torso when he woke up this morning, and it has spread down his legs over the last few hours. He also endorses fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days. The patient reports that he was seen yesterday at his college’s student health clinic for similar symptoms and was prescribed amoxicillin. He also reports that his younger sister was recently diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis, and his mother has psoriatic arthritis.

But maybe sore throat counts? No. So score 0.</think> But let's break it down step-by-step systematically. Step 1: Identify the Centor Score criteria: - Tonsillar exudates - Absence of cough - Presence of fever (temperature > 38.3°C or 100.9°F) - Presence of tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy - Presence of history of rhinorrhea or conjunctivitis (this is not part of the standard Centor Score but is sometimes included in modified versions; we'll stick to the standard Centor Score for this task). Step 2: Evaluate each criterion based on the given patient note. Criterion 1: Tonsillar Exudates - The patient note mentions "an erythematous oropharynx." It does not explicitly mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Criterion 2: Absence of Cough - The patient note states that the patient endorses "fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days." There is no mention of a cough. Therefore, this criterion is met. Criterion 3: Presence of Fever (temperature > 38.3°C or 100.9°F) - The patient's temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C). This is just below the threshold of 38.3°C (100.9°F). Therefore, this criterion is not met. Criterion 4: Presence of Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy - The patient note mentions "posterior cervical lymphadenopathy." The Centor Score requires "tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy." Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is different from anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria met: - Tonsillar Exudates: No - Absence of Cough: Yes - Presence of Fever: No - Presence of Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: No So, the number of criteria met is 1 (Absence of Cough). Therefore, the Centor Score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the following criteria:\n1. Tonsillar exudates\n2. Absence of cough\n3. Fever > 38.3°C (100.9°F)\n4.

Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\nCriterion 2: Absence of Cough\nThe patient note does not mention a cough.

Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\nCriterion 4: Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy\nThe note mentions \"posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.\" The Centor Score requires \"tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.\" Since it mentions posterior lymphadenopathy and not anterior, and it doesn't specify if it's tender, this criterion is not met.\n\nNow, let's count the number of criteria met:\n- Tonsillar Exudates: No\n- Absence of Cough: Yes\n- Presence of Fever: No\n- Presence of Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: No\n\nThus, only 1 criterion (Absence of Cough) is met.\nTherefore, the Centor Score is 1.", "answer": "1"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L. On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact. Here is the task: What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think>We need to count criteria met for PERC rule. PERC criteria: age <50, heart rate <100, oxygen sat >=95, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, no prior VTE, no estrogen use, no surgery/trauma in past 4 weeks. Patient is 57 -> fails age. So 0 criteria met.</think> However, let's go through the patient note step-by-step to check if any of the PERC rule criteria are met. The PERC rule consists of the following 8 criteria: 1. Age < 50 years 2. Heart rate < 100 bpm 3. Oxygen saturation ≥ 95% 4. No hemoptysis 5. No unilateral leg swelling 6. No prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 7. Not on estrogen therapy 8. No surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks Now let's evaluate each criterion based on the given patient note: 1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 57 years old. This criterion is not met. 2. **Heart rate < 100 bpm**: The patient's heart rate is 114 bpm. This criterion is not met. 3. **Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%**: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. This implies that the oxygen saturation was below 90% without oxygen supplementation. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 4. **No hemoptysis**: The patient note does not mention hemoptysis. We can assume this criterion is met unless there is evidence to the contrary. 5. **No unilateral leg swelling**: The patient note does not mention any leg swelling. We can assume this criterion is met unless there is evidence to the contrary. 6. **No prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: The patient note does not mention any history of VTE. We can assume this criterion is met unless there is evidence to the contrary. 7. **Not on estrogen therapy**: The patient note does not mention estrogen use. We can assume this criterion is met unless there is evidence to the contrary. 8. **No surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks**: The patient note does not mention any recent surgery or trauma. We can assume this criterion is met unless there is evidence to the contrary. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Criterion 1 (Age < 50 years): Not met (57 years old) - Criterion 2 (Heart rate < 100 bpm): Not met (heart rate 114 bpm) - Criterion 3 (Oxygen saturation ≥ 95%): Not met (required oxygen to maintain saturation above 90%) - Criterion 4 (No hemoptysis): Met (no mention of hemoptysis) - Criterion 5 (No unilateral leg swelling): Met (no mention of leg swelling) - Criterion 6 (No prior history of VTE): Met (no mention of VTE) - Criterion 7 (Not on estrogen therapy): Met (no mention of estrogen use) - Criterion 8 (No surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks): Met (no mention of recent surgery or trauma) So the criteria that are met are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. That's a total of 5 criteria met. Thus, the number of criteria met for the PERC rule is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To determine the number of criteria met for the PERC rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE), we will evaluate each of the 8 criteria based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\nThe 8 criteria for the PERC rule are:\n1.

Provide answer.</think> But the patient's weight is not given in the note. The note mentions a 22-year-old male, but it does not provide the patient's weight. Without the patient's weight, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluid requirement. So the correct approach is to state that the information is insufficient. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the maintenance fluid requirement, we need the patient's weight.

Without the weight, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluid requirement.", "answer": "Insufficient information"} But since the question seems to imply that the weight is 22 kg (which is unrealistic for a 22-year-old male), let's calculate it assuming the weight is 22 kg. If the weight is 22 kg: 1. Maintenance fluid for adults is 30-40 mL/kg/day. Let's use 30 mL/kg/day for calculation. 2. For a 22 kg patient, the daily maintenance fluid would be $22 \, \text{kg} \times 30 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 660 \, \text{mL/day}$. 3. To convert this to mL/hr, divide by 24 hours: $\frac{660 \, \text{mL}}{24 \, \text{hours}} = 27.5 \, \text{mL/hr}$. So the maintenance fluid requirement would be 27.5 mL/hr if the weight is 22 kg. But this is an unrealistic assumption for a 22-year-old male. Let's assume the weight is a typical adult weight, say 70 kg. If the weight is 70 kg: 1. Maintenance fluid for adults is 30-40 mL/kg/day. Let's use 30 mL/kg/day for calculation. 2. For a 70 kg patient, the daily maintenance fluid would be $70 \, \text{kg} \times 30 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 2100 \, \text{mL/day}$. 3. To convert this to mL/hr, divide by 24 hours: $\frac{2100 \, \text{mL}}{24 \, \text{hours}} = 87.5 \, \text{mL/hr}$. So the maintenance fluid requirement would be 87.5 mL/hr if the weight is 70 kg. Since the weight is not provided in the note, the correct answer is that we do not have enough information. Thus the final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the maintenance fluid requirement, we need the patient's weight.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Glasgow Coma Score?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED We need GCS. Eye opening: slight opening to pain? He opened eyes slightly to sternal rub. That is eye response 2 (to pain). Verbal: nonverbal, not responsive to questions or requests. That is 1 (no verbal response). Motor: limbs hesitatingly reflex into extension movement. That is abnormal flexion? Actually extension is decorticate? Wait: reflex into extension movement: extension is abnormal? In GCS motor: 6 = obey commands, 5 = localizes pain, 4 = withdraws from pain, 3 = abnormal flexion (decorticate), 2 = extension (decerebrate), 1 = none. He has extension movement, so motor 2. So total GCS = 2+1+2 = 5.

A 63 year old female a history of prior DVT is being evaluated at a rehabilitation facility following multiple traumas sustained in a motor vehicle collision. She was transferred to the facility 1 day ago following discharge from the hospital with injuries including multiple rib fractures, a left femoral shaft fracture, and a traumatic brain injury. There was no spinal cord damage or paralysis bhe patient remains confined to bed due to her injuries. The patient denies history of heart failure, any recent infections or sepsis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy. Prior coagulability workup in the patient revealed elevated serum homocysteine, and was otherwise negative for factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibody. Heparin has been administered throughout the hospitalization with no complications and the patient has no other history of congenital or acquired thrombophilia. The patient's mother had a DVT/PE in her 50's. The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. Physical exam of the lower extremities is notable for a well-healed surgical incision over the left femoral shaft with no signs of infection. There patient has varicose veins bilaterally. There is no lower extremity edema. Range of motion of the left hip and knee are limited due to pain and immobilization. The patient will continue rehabilitation with physical and occupational therapy at the facility to optimize functional recovery.

So answer 9.</think> Let's calculate the Caprini score step by step for this patient. Step 1: Identify the risk factors and their corresponding points according to the Caprini VTE risk assessment model. The Caprini score includes the following risk factors: - Age: 1 point for age 61-74 years (the patient is 63 years old, so this is 1 point). - Prior DVT: 3 points (the patient has a history of prior DVT, so this is 3 points). - Surgery or Trauma: The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and sustained multiple traumas including a left femoral shaft fracture. This qualifies as a recent trauma. For trauma, the Caprini score assigns 2 points for major trauma. - Immobilization: The patient is confined to bed due to her injuries. Immobilization for more than 3 days gets 1 point. Since she was transferred to the rehabilitation facility 1 day ago from the hospital and is still confined to bed, it's reasonable to assume that she has been immobilized for more than 3 days. So, this is 1 point. - Obesity: The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. A BMI between 25 and 29.9 gets 1 point. So, this is 1 point. - Varicose veins: The patient has varicose veins bilaterally. This gets 1 point. Now let's add up the points: - Age 61-74: 1 point - Prior DVT: 3 points - Recent major trauma: 2 points - Immobilization > 3 days: 1 point - BMI 25-29.9: 1 point - Varicose veins: 1 point Adding these up: 1 (age) + 3 (prior DVT) + 2 (trauma) + 1 (immobilization) + 1 (BMI) + 1 (varicose veins) = 9 points. So the Caprini score for this patient is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Caprini score for this patient, we will evaluate each risk factor and assign the corresponding points as per the Caprini VTE risk assessment model.\n\n1.

Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in milliseconds. The heart rate (HR) is 79 bpm. The formula to calculate the RR interval in milliseconds is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{\text{HR}}. \] Plugging in the heart rate: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{79} \approx 759.49 \, \text{ms}. \] Step 2: Use the Rautaharju formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Rautaharju formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 ms and the RR interval is approximately 759.49 ms, we can plug these values into the formula. First, calculate \(\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}\): \[ \frac{\text{RR}}{1000} = \frac{759.49}{1000} = 0.75949. \] Next, take the square root of this value: \[ \sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}} = \sqrt{0.75949} \approx 0.8714. \] Now, use this result to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.8714} \approx 378.7. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 379 ms. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 379 msec. The final answer is 379. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Rautaharju formula, we follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the RR interval in milliseconds.

The Hodges formula is not the one I used. The correct formula for the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is actually not the one I used. The Hodges formula is not commonly used. The most common formulas for correcting the QT interval are the Bazett's formula, Fridericia's formula, and the Framingham formula. However, since the task specifically mentions the "Hodges Formula," I will assume it's a hypothetical or less common formula. But let's use the correct formula for the task. The Hodges formula is not a standard formula for correcting the QT interval. It seems there might be a mix-up. Let's use the Bazett's formula for the sake of this calculation, which is one of the most common formulas for correcting the QT interval. The Bazett's formula is: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where the RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate (HR). The heart rate is given as 161 bpm. To convert this to the RR interval in seconds, we use the formula: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}}. \] So, \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{161} \approx 0.3727 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we can plug this into the Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3727}}. \] Let's calculate the square root of 0.3727: \[ \sqrt{0.3727} \approx 0.6105. \] Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6105} \approx 540.6. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 541 msec. However, since the task specifically asks for the "Hodges Formula," and if we assume that the Hodges formula is not a standard formula and might be a hypothetical one, let's assume the Hodges formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60). \] Let's use this formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. Given: - QT = 330 msec, - HR = 161 bpm. Using the formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 1.75 \times (161 - 60). \] First, calculate \(161 - 60\): \[ 161 - 60 = 101. \] Now multiply by 1.75: \[ 1.75 \times 101 = 176.75. \] Then add this result to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 176.75 = 506.75. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 507 msec. So the corrected QT interval using the hypothetical Hodges formula is 507 msec. Thus, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. We have the given values: QT = 330 msec and HR = 161 bpm. 2. We use the hypothetical Hodges formula: \(\text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60)\). 3. Calculate \(\text{HR} - 60\): \(161 - 60 = 101\). 4. Multiply the result by 1.75: \(1.75 \times 101 = 176.75\). 5. Add this to the QT interval: \(330 + 176.75 = 506.75\). 6. Round the result to the nearest whole number: 507 msec. So the final answer is 507 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.

Provide answer.</think> To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the given values. - The patient's heart rate (HR) is 72 bpm. - The QT interval is 330 msec. Step 2: Calculate the RR interval in seconds. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated as the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute converted to seconds. The formula is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] Plugging in the given heart rate: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{72} = 0.8333 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 3: Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Bazett formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] We have the QT interval = 330 msec and the RR interval = 0.8333 seconds. Now we need to calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.8333} \approx 0.9128. \] Now, plug the values into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.9128} \approx 361.5. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 362 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 362 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().\nThe patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.', 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Calculate (1.65)^2: 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225. Now, divide the weight by this squared height: 60.2 / 2.7225 ≈ 22.11.

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

July 18 to July 31 =13 days. Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 31, Nov 30, Dec 31, Jan 31, Feb 9. Sum: 13+31+30+31+30+31+31+9= 226 days. Weeks: 226/7=32 weeks 2 days (since 32*7=224). So answer (32 weeks, 2 days).</think> However, let's calculate it step by step systematically. Step 1: Calculate the number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011. - From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: - Days in July from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. - August 2010 has 31 days. - September 2010 has 30 days. - October 2010 has 31 days. - November 2010 has 30 days. - December 2010 has 31 days. - January 2011 has 31 days. - From February 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011, there are 9 days. Now, sum up all these days: - Days from July 18 to July 31, 2010: 14 days. - August 2010: 31 days. - September 2010: 30 days. - October 2010: 31 days. - November 2010: 30 days. - December 2010: 31 days. - January 2011: 31 days. - February 1 to February 9, 2011: 9 days. Add them together: \[14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 9\] Let's calculate this step by step: \[14 + 31 = 45\] \[45 + 30 = 75\] \[75 + 31 = 106\] \[106 + 30 = 136\] \[136 + 31 = 167\] \[167 + 31 = 198\] \[198 + 9 = 207\] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 207 days. Step 2: Convert the total number of days into weeks and days. Since 1 week = 7 days, we divide 207 by 7 to get the number of weeks and the remaining days. \[207 \div 7 = 29 \text{ weeks and a remainder of } 207 - (29 \times 7) = 207 - 203 = 4 \text{ days}.\] Therefore, 207 days is equal to 29 weeks and 4 days. So the estimated gestational age is (29 weeks, 4 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP), which is July 18, 2010, and today's date, February 9, 2011. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of days from July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010. \nFrom July 18 to July 31: 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days.\n\nStep 2: Add the number of days in each month from August 2010 through January 2011.\n- August 2010: 31 days.\n- September 2010: 30 days.\n- October 2010: 31 days.\n- November 2010: 30 days.\n- December 2010: 31 days.\n- January 2011: 31 days.\n\nStep 3: Add the number of days from February 1 to February 9, 2011.\nFrom February 1 to February 9: 9 days.\n\nNow, sum up all these days:\n14 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 9 (February) = 14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 9.\n\nPerform the addition step by step:\n14 + 31 = 45,\n45 + 30 = 75,\n75 + 31 = 106,\n106 + 30 = 136,\n136 + 31 = 167,\n167 + 31 = 198,\n198 + 9 = 207.\n\nSo, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 207 days.\n\nStep 4: Convert 207 days into weeks and days.\nSince 1 week = 7 days, we divide 207 by 7.\n207 ÷ 7 = 29 weeks with a remainder of 207 - (29 * 7) = 207 - 203 = 4 days.\n\nTherefore, 207 days is equal to 29 weeks and 4 days.\n\nThus, the estimated gestational age is (29 weeks, 4 days).", "answer": "(29 weeks, 4 days)"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

Provide that.</think> However, let's approach this step-by-step systematically. Step 1: Identify the values needed for the calculation of the anion gap and the delta gap. The anion gap is given as 30 mmol/L. The bicarbonate level is given as 9 mmol/L. Step 2: Use the formula for the delta gap. The formula for the delta gap is: \[ \Delta \text{Gap} = \frac{\text{Anion Gap} - 12}{\text{Bicarbonate} - 24} \] Plugging in the given values: Anion gap = 30 mmol/L Bicarbonate = 9 mmol/L So, \[ \Delta \text{Gap} = \frac{30 - 12}{9 - 24} = \frac{18}{-15} = -1.2 \] Thus, the delta gap is -1.2 mEq/L. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the anion gap and bicarbonate levels from the patient's blood chemistry results. - Anion gap = 30 mmol/L - Bicarbonate = 9 mmol/L 2. Use the formula for the delta gap: \[ \Delta \text{Gap} = \frac{\text{Anion Gap} - 12}{\text{Bicarbonate} - 24} \] 3. Substitute the values into the formula: \[ \Delta \text{Gap} = \frac{30 - 12}{9 - 24} = \frac{18}{-15} = -1.2 \] Therefore, the delta gap is -1.2 mEq/L. The final answer is -1.2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, we use the formula: \n\[ \\Delta \\text{Gap} = \\frac{\\text{Anion Gap} - 12}{\\text{Bicarbonate} - 24}. \]\nFrom the patient's data, we have:\n- Anion gap = 30 mmol/L\n- Bicarbonate = 9 mmol/L.\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\[ \\Delta \\text{Gap} = \\frac{30 - 12}{9 - 24} = \\frac{18}{-15} = -1.2. \]\nThus, the delta gap is -1.2 mEq/L.", "answer": "-1.2"}

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day.

Answer 4.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Hematologic, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and CNS. Let's break this down step by step. 1. **Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂):** - PaO₂ = 77 mm Hg - FiO₂ = 54% = 0.54 - PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio = 77 / 0.54 ≈ 142.6 - According to the SOFA scoring for the respiratory system: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: 0 points - 300-400: 1 point - 200-300: 2 points - 100-200: 3 points - <100: 4 points - Since 142.6 falls within the range 100-200, the score is 3 points. 2. **Hematologic (Platelets):** - Platelet count = 180,000/µL - According to the SOFA scoring for the hematologic system: - >= 150,000: 0 points - 100,000 - 149,999: 1 point - 50,000 - 99,999: 2 points - <50,000: 4 points - Since the platelet count is 180,000, which is >= 150,000, the score is 0 points. 3. **Liver (Bilirubin):** - Bilirubin = 1.7 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the liver system: - < 2: 0 points - 2 - 6.9: 1 point - 7 - 11.9: 2 points - >= 12: 3 points - Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, which is < 2, the score is 0 points. Wait, it seems I made an error. The correct ranges for bilirubin in the SOFA score are: - < 2: 0 points - 2 - 6.9: 1 point - 7 - 11.9: 2 points - >= 12: 3 points. - Since 1.7 mg/dL is < 2, the score should be 0 points. But the note says "possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities," and the bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL. Let's check the correct ranges for the SOFA score for bilirubin: - < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2 - 1.9: 1 point - 2 - 6.9: 2 points - >= 7: 3 points Since the bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL, it falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, so the score is 1 point. 4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Support):** - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min respectively, and norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. - First, calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). The blood pressure is given as 120/80 mm Hg. - MAP = Diastolic BP + 1/3 * (Systolic BP - Diastolic BP) = 80 + 1/3 * (120 - 80) = 80 + 1/3 * 40 = 80 + 13.3 = 93.3 mm Hg. - Since the MAP is 93.3 mm Hg, which is > 70 mm Hg, we need to look at the vasopressor support to determine the score. - The SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system is based on both MAP and vasopressor use: - MAP >= 70 and no vasopressors: 0 points - MAP >= 70 and vasopressors required to maintain MAP: 1 point if vasopressors required to maintain MAP >= 40 mm Hg and dose of vasopressor is < 5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent. - MAP < 70 or vasopressors required to maintain MAP >= 70 with a dose > 15 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent: 2 points - MAP < 70 or vasopressors required to maintain MAP >= 70 with a dose > 15 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent: 3 points if the dose is > 15 mcg/kg/min. - MAP < 70 or vasopressors required to maintain MAP >= 70 with a dose > 20 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent: 4 points Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, we need to convert the doses to their norepinephrine equivalents. - DOPamine: typically, doses up to 5 mcg/kg/min are considered mild support. - DOBUTamine is not typically used as a vasopressor but rather as an inotrope. - NorEPINEPHrine: 0.07 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine: 0.03 mcg/kg/min To calculate the total vasopressor support in terms of norepinephrine equivalents: - Dopamine: - < 5 mcg/kg/min: considered mild support and can be roughly equivalent to low-dose norepinephrine. - 5-10 mcg/kg/min: moderate support. - > 10 mcg/kg/min: high support. For simplicity, let's convert the doses: - DOPamine at 4 mcg/kg/min: This is typically considered to have some vasopressor effect. A rough conversion is that 10 mcg/kg/min of dopamine is roughly equivalent to 1 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Therefore, 4 mcg/kg/min of dopamine is approximately 0.4 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. - DOBUTamine at 3.5 mcg/kg/min: This is primarily an inotrope and has minimal vasopressor effect. We will consider it negligible for the vasopressor score. - NorEPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min: This is already in norepinephrine units. - EPINEPHrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min: 1 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine is roughly equivalent to 2-3 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Therefore, 0.03 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine is approximately 0.06-0.09 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Let's take the average and say it's about 0.075 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Now, sum up the norepinephrine equivalents: - DOPamine: 0.4 mcg/kg/min - NorEPINEPHrine: 0.07 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine: 0.075 mcg/kg/min Total norepinephrine equivalent = 0.4 + 0.07 + 0.075 = 0.545 mcg/kg/min. Since the total vasopressor support is 0.545 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent and the MAP is 93.3 mm Hg (which is > 70 mm Hg), the patient is using vasopressors to maintain the MAP. According to the SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system with MAP > 70 and vasopressor use: - If the total vasopressor dose is < 5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent, the score is 1 point. Since 0.545 mcg/kg/min is < 5 mcg/kg/min, the score for the cardiovascular system is 1 point. 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the renal system: - < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2 - 1.9: 1 point - 2 - 3.4: 2 points - > 3.4: 3 points - Since the creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, so the score is 1 point. 6. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Score - GCS):** - GCS = 13 - According to the SOFA scoring for the CNS: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 13-14: 1 point - GCS 10-12: 2 points - GCS 5-9: 3 points - GCS < 5: 4 points - Since the GCS is 13, the score is 1 point.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

The baseline values are not needed for this calculation, so the delta gap is 13 mEq/L.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '13', 'Target Explanation': 'To calculate the delta gap, we need both the current anion gap and the baseline anion gap. The formula for the anion gap is: Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3). Given the current lab values: Na = 135 mmol/L, Cl = 103 mmol/L, and HCO3 = 19 mmol/L. We can calculate the current anion gap as follows: Anion gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 mEq/L. Since the baseline anion gap is not provided in the patient note, we cannot calculate the delta gap directly. However, if the question is asking for the current anion gap, the answer is 13 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '1', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 19.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 19.0 mEq/L) = 13.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 13.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 13.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 13.0 - 12 = 1.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 1.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

So answer 14.</think> Let's calculate the APACHE II score step by step. 1. **Age**: The patient is 73 years old. According to the APACHE II scoring system, the age score is as follows: - 71-80 years: 5 points. - Therefore, the age score is 5. 2. **Temperature**: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. The APACHE II scoring for temperature is: - 36.1-38.0°C: 0 points. - Therefore, the temperature score is 0. 3. **Heart Rate (HR)**: The patient's heart rate is 107 beats per minute. The APACHE II scoring for heart rate is: - 41-100 or 101-140: 0 points. - 141-180: 1 point. - <40 or >180: 2 points. - Since the heart rate is 107, it falls within the range 101-140, which gives 0 points. - Therefore, the heart rate score is 0. 4. **Respiratory Rate (RR)**: The patient's respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. The APACHE II scoring for respiratory rate is: - 12-20: 0 points. - 21-30: 1 point. - >30: 3 points. - Since the respiratory rate is 35, it falls into the category >30, which gives 3 points. - Therefore, the respiratory rate score is 3. 5. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: The patient's blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg. We need to calculate the MAP: - MAP = (2 * diastolic + systolic) / 3 = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = (184 + 138) / 3 = 322 / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. - The APACHE II scoring for MAP is: - 70-110: 0 points. - <70: 2 points. - >110: 1 point. - Since the MAP is 107.3, it falls within the range 70-110, which gives 0 points. - Therefore, the MAP score is 0. 6. **Arterial Blood Gas (PaO2)**: The patient's PaO2 is 78 mmHg. The APACHE II scoring for PaO2 is based on the PaO2 value: - >100: 0 points. - 81-100: 1 point. - 61-80: 2 points. - 51-60: 3 points. - 41-50: 4 points. - <40: 5 points. - Since the PaO2 is 78 mmHg, it falls within the range 61-80, which gives 2 points. - However, we also need to consider the FiO2. The patient is on FiO2 0.63. To adjust for the FiO2, we use the PaO2/FiO2 ratio: - PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. - If the PaO2/FiO2 is <200, the score is 3 points. - If the PaO2/FiO2 is between 200 and 300, the score is 2 points. - If the PaO2/FiO2 is >300, the score is 0 points. - Since the PaO2/FiO2 is approximately 123.81, which is <200, the score for PaO2 is 3 points. - Therefore, the PaO2 score is 3. 7. **Serum Sodium**: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum sodium is: - 130-155: 0 points. - <130: 2 points. - >155: 1 point. - Since the sodium level is 143.21, it falls within the range 130-155, which gives 0 points. - Therefore, the serum sodium score is 0. 8. **Serum Potassium**: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum potassium is: - 3.5-5.5: 0 points. - <3.5: 1 point. - >5.5: 1 point. - Since the potassium level is 3.68, it falls within the range 3.5-5.5, which gives 0 points. - Therefore, the serum potassium score is 0. 9. **Creatinine**: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. The APACHE II scoring for creatinine is: - <1.5: 0 points. - 1.5-1.9: 1 point. - 2.0-2.9: 2 points. - 3.0-4.9: 3 points. - >5.0: 4 points. - Since the creatinine level is 4.58, it falls within the range 3.0-4.9, which gives 3 points. - Therefore, the creatinine score is 3. 10. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: The patient's GCS is 15. The APACHE II scoring for GCS is: - 15: 0 points. - 13-14: 1 point. - 10-12: 2 points. - 5-9: 3 points. - <5: 4 points. - Since the GCS is 15, it gives 0 points. - Therefore, the GCS score is 0. 11. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: The patient's WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.105 x 10^3 cells/µL or 15.105 K/µL). The APACHE II scoring for WBC is: - 1-12: 0 points. - 13-17: 1 point. - 18-24: 2 points. - 25-99: 3 points. - >100: 4 points. - Since the WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL (or 15.105 K/µL), it falls into the category >100, which gives 4 points. - Therefore, the WBC score is 4. Now, we sum up all the scores: - Age: 5 - Temperature: 0 - Heart Rate: 0 - Respiratory Rate: 3 - MAP: 0 - PaO2: 3 - Serum Sodium: 0 - Serum Potassium: 0 - Creatinine: 3 - GCS: 0 - WBC: 4 Total APACHE II score = 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 4 = 18. Therefore, the APACHE II score is 18. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score for the patient, we will use the given parameters and the APACHE II scoring system.

So, the age score is 5.\n\n2. **Temperature**: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. The APACHE II scoring for temperature within the range 36.1-38.0°C is 0 points. Therefore, the temperature score is 0.\n\n3. **Heart Rate (HR)**: The patient's heart rate is 107 beats per minute. The APACHE II scoring for heart rate between 101-140 is 0 points. Therefore, the heart rate score is 0.\n\n4. **Respiratory Rate (RR)**: The patient's respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. The APACHE II scoring for a respiratory rate >30 is 3 points. Therefore, the respiratory rate score is 3.\n\n5. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: The blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg. Calculating MAP: MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. The APACHE II scoring for MAP within the range 70-110 is 0 points. Therefore, the MAP score is 0.\n\n6. **Arterial Blood Gas (PaO2)**: The patient's PaO2 is 78 mmHg, and the FiO2 is 0.63. To determine the PaO2 score, we use the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. Since the PaO2/FiO2 is <200, the score for PaO2 is 3 points. Therefore, the PaO2 score is 3.\n\n7. **Serum Sodium**: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum sodium within the range 130-155 is 0 points. Therefore, the serum sodium score is 0.\n\n8. **Serum Potassium**: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum potassium within the range 3.5-5.5 is 0 points. Therefore, the serum potassium score is 0.\n\n9. **Creatinine**: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. The APACHE II scoring for creatinine within the range 3.0-4.9 is 3 points. Therefore, the creatinine score is 3.\n\n10. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: The patient's GCS is 15. The APACHE II scoring for GCS of 15 is 0 points. Therefore, the GCS score is 0.\n\n11. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: The patient's WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL (or 15.105 K/µL). The APACHE II scoring for WBC >100 is 4 points. Therefore, the WBC score is 4.\n\nNow, we add up all the scores:\nAge: 5\nTemperature: 0\nHeart Rate: 0\nRespiratory Rate: 3\nMAP: 0\nPaO2: 3\nSerum Sodium: 0\nSerum Potassium: 0\nCreatinine: 3\nGCS: 0\nWBC: 4\n\nTotal APACHE II score = 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 4 = 18.", "answer": "18"}

Therefore, the respiratory rate score is 3.\\n\\n5. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: The blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg. Calculating MAP: MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. The APACHE II scoring for MAP within the range 70-110 is 0 points. Therefore, the MAP score is 0.\\n\\n6. **Arterial Blood Gas (PaO2)**: The patient's PaO2 is 78 mmHg, and the FiO2 is 0.63. To determine the PaO2 score, we use the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. Since the PaO2/FiO2 is <200, the score for PaO2 is 3 points. Therefore, the PaO2 score is 3.\\n\\n7. **Serum Sodium**: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum sodium within the range 130-155 is 0 points. Therefore, the serum sodium score is 0.\\n\\n8. **Serum Potassium**: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for serum potassium within the range 3.5-5.5 is 0 points. Therefore, the serum potassium score is 0.\\n\\n9. **Creatinine**: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. The APACHE II scoring for creatinine within the range 3.0-4.9 is 3 points. Therefore, the creatinine score is 3.\\n\\n10. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: The patient's GCS is 15. The APACHE II scoring for GCS of 15 is 0 points. Therefore, the GCS score is 0.\\n\\n11. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: The patient's WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL (or 15.105 K/µL). The APACHE II scoring for WBC >100 is 4 points. Therefore, the WBC score is 4.\\n\\nNow, we add up all the scores:\\nAge: 5\\nTemperature: 0\\nHeart Rate: 0\\nRespiratory Rate: 3\\nMAP: 0\\nPaO2: 3\\nSerum Sodium: 0\\nSerum Potassium: 0\\nCreatinine: 3\\nGCS: 0\\nWBC: 4\\n\\nTotal APACHE II score = 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 4 = 18.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '41', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 73.0 years old. The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative . Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 92.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 138.0 mm Hg = 107.333 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 107.333 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 35 and 49 breaths per minute, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 11 + 3 = 14.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 14 + 8 = 22.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 22. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 22 + 4 = 26.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 26 = 41.0.

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old gentleman presents with episodes of dizziness and palpitations. His past medical history is significant for a previous stroke and uncontrolled hypertension (182/111). Blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80 % of the time. A significant bleeding event that happened following a minor operative procedure is documented and requires careful attention. His lifestyle habits include moderate alcohol consumption, tallying approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. Despite the other complexities, the liver function tests appear normal suggesting no liver disease, and similar is the case with his renal function tests showing no kidney impairment.

Since systolic BP >160 mmHg and diastolic BP >100 mmHg, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **Abnormal Renal/Liver Function (A):** The patient's liver function tests appear normal, and there is no kidney impairment (renal function tests are normal). Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 3. **Stroke (S):** The patient has a past medical history of a previous stroke. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 4. **Bleeding history or predisposition (B):** The patient has a documented significant bleeding event following a minor operative procedure. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 5. **Labile INR (L):** The patient's blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80% of the time. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 6. **Elderly (E):** The patient is 59 years old. Since the age is not greater than 65, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 7. **Drugs/Alcohol (D):** The patient has moderate alcohol consumption, approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. This is not considered heavy alcohol consumption. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

So answer: 10, Class C.</think> To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters and assign points to each: 1. Encephalopathy 2. Ascites 3. Bilirubin 4. Albumin 5. INR Let's go through each parameter step-by-step. 1. **Encephalopathy:** - The patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis. This indicates some level of confusion and neurological impairment. - Child-Pugh classification for encephalopathy: - Grade 0: None = 1 point - Grade 1: Trivial (drowsiness) = 1 point - Grade 2: Mild (disorientation for time or place) = 2 points - Grade 3: Stupor = 3 points - Grade 4: Coma = 4 points Given the patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis, this suggests at least some degree of confusion. Therefore, it likely corresponds to Grade 2 (mild encephalopathy, with disorientation). So, we assign 2 points for encephalopathy. 2. **Ascites:** - The abdominal exam is negative for ascites. - Child-Pugh classification for ascites: - None = 1 point - Mild = 2 points - Moderate or Tense = 3 points Since there is no ascites, we assign 1 point for ascites. 3. **Bilirubin:** - The bilirubin level is 40.2 umol/L. - Convert bilirubin from umol/L to mg/dL: \[ \text{Bilirubin in mg/dL} = \frac{\text{Bilirubin in umol/L}}{17.1} \] \[ \text{Bilirubin in mg/dL} = \frac{40.2}{17.1} \approx 2.35 \, \text{mg/dL} \] Child-Pugh classification for bilirubin: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3 mg/dL = 3 points Since the bilirubin is approximately 2.35 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 2-3 mg/dL. Therefore, we assign 2 points for bilirubin. 4. **Albumin:** - The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. - Child-Pugh classification for albumin: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - < 2.8 g/dL = 3 points Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL. Therefore, we assign 2 points for albumin. 5. **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - The INR is 2.1. - Child-Pugh classification for INR: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - > 2.3 = 3 points Since the INR is 2.1, it falls within the range of 1.7-2.3. Therefore, we assign 2 points for INR. Now, let's sum up the points for each parameter: - Encephalopathy: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Bilirubin: 2 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points Total Child-Pugh score = 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: 5-6 points - Class B: 7-9 points - Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Class B. So the Child-Pugh score is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters and assign points to each: 1. Encephalopathy, 2. Ascites, 3.

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 µmol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells.

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma.

Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 36.3 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg.

Total MME = 6000+240+6000=12240 MME.</think> It seems there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the doses and their conversions. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME. The patient takes a 60 mg Fentanyl patch once a day. The conversion factor for Fentanyl patches is typically that 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is equivalent to 9 MME/day. A 60 mg Fentanyl patch delivers 60 mcg/hour continuously over 72 hours. But if we're considering the daily dose, we need to convert the 60 mg patch to its hourly release and then to MME. However, a common conversion is that a 60 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch is equivalent to approximately 180 MME/day. Let's use this approach. If the patient is using a 60 mg Fentanyl patch, it's likely a typo or misunderstanding. Typically, Fentanyl patches come in doses like 25 mcg/h, 50 mcg/h, 75 mcg/h, etc. Let's assume the patient is using a 60 mcg/h Fentanyl patch. The conversion for a Fentanyl patch is: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = 9 MME/day. So for a 60 mcg/h Fentanyl patch: 60 mcg/h * 9 MME/day per mcg/h = 540 MME/day. Step 2: Convert the Hydrocodone dose to MME. The patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day. This means the total daily dose of Hydrocodone is: 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg/day. The conversion factor for Hydrocodone is 1 mg of Hydrocodone = 2 MME. So, 60 mg of Hydrocodone = 60 mg * 2 MME/mg = 120 MME. Step 3: Convert the Fentanyl buccal dose to MME. The patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day. This means the total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is: 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg/day. The conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 100 MME. So, 60 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 60 mg * 100 MME/mg = 6000 MME. Now, we add up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME. Total MME = MME from Fentanyl patch + MME from Hydrocodone + MME from Fentanyl buccal Total MME = 540 MME (from Fentanyl patch) + 120 MME (from Hydrocodone) + 6000 MME (from Fentanyl buccal) Total MME = 540 + 120 + 6000 = 6660 MME. So the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 6660. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\nStep 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME.\nAssume the patient is using a 60 mcg/h Fentanyl patch.\nThe conversion factor is 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = 9 MME/day.\nSo for a 60 mcg/h Fentanyl patch:\n60 mcg/h * 9 MME/day per mcg/h = 540 MME/day.\n\nStep 2: Convert the Hydrocodone dose to MME.\nThe patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day.\nTotal daily dose = 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg/day.\nThe conversion factor for Hydrocodone is 1 mg = 2 MME.\nSo, 60 mg of Hydrocodone = 60 mg * 2 MME/mg = 120 MME.\n\nStep 3: Convert the Fentanyl buccal dose to MME.\nThe patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day.\nTotal daily dose = 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg/day.\nThe conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is 1 mg = 100 MME.\nSo, 60 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 60 mg * 100 MME/mg = 6000 MME.\n\nNow, we add up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME.\nTotal MME = MME from Fentanyl patch + MME from Hydrocodone + MME from Fentanyl buccal\nTotal MME = 540 MME (from Fentanyl patch) + 120 MME (from Hydrocodone) + 6000 MME (from Fentanyl buccal)\nTotal MME = 540 + 120 + 6000 = 6660 MME.", "answer": "6660"}

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Urea (U):** The BUN (blood urea nitrogen) is given as 21 mg/dL. Since BUN > 19 mg/dL, this criterion is met. This gives 1 point. - **Respiratory rate (R):** The respiratory rate (RR) is 19 breaths per minute. Since RR < 30 breaths per minute, this criterion is not met. - **Blood pressure (B):** The blood pressure is 121/79 mmHg. The systolic BP is 121 mmHg, which is not < 90 mmHg, and the diastolic BP is 79 mmHg, which is not <= 60 mmHg. Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Age 65 or older (65):** The patient is 41 years old. Since the patient is not 65 years or older, this criterion is not met. Now, let's count the total score: - Confusion: No (0 points) - Urea: Yes (1 point) - Respiratory rate: No (0 points) - Blood pressure: No (0 points) - Age >= 65: No (0 points) Adding up the points: 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 Therefore, the patient's CURB-65 score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to evaluate the following components: C (Confusion), U (Urea > 19 mg/dL), R (Respiratory rate >= 30 breaths/min), B (Blood pressure: systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic <= 60 mmHg), and 65 (Age >= 65 years).

Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 21.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 121 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 79 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 1.\nThe patient's Curb-65 score is 1.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

Provide answer.</think> It seems there's a misunderstanding with the given information. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the doses of each medication to MME. 1. **Hydromorphone**: The patient takes 10 mg of hydromorphone once a day. - The conversion factor from hydromorphone to MME is 4. - Therefore, 10 mg of hydromorphone = 10 mg * 4 = 40 MME. 2. **Fentanyl Patch**: The patient takes 40 mg of fentanyl patch 3 times a day. - This seems unusual because fentanyl patches are typically measured in micrograms (mcg) and not milligrams (mg). However, we'll use the given information as it is. - The conversion factor for fentanyl patches is that 1 mcg/hour of fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 2.4 MME/day. But if we take the given information as 40 mg patches, it's highly unusual and likely a mistake. Let's assume it's a typo and it should be 40 mcg/hour patches. - A 40 mcg/hour fentanyl patch delivers 40 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 960 mcg/day. - The MME for a 40 mcg/hour patch is approximately 960 mcg/day * (2.4 MME / 1000 mcg) = 2.304 MME/day for one patch. - Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, this would mean they are using 3 patches per day. Therefore, the total MME from the fentanyl patches would be 2.304 MME/patch * 3 patches = 6.912 MME/day. But if we take the given information literally (40 mg patches), it's not standard and would require a different approach. Let's assume it's a typo and use the 40 mcg/hour approach. 3. **Tramadol**: The patient takes 60 mg of tramadol twice a day. - The conversion factor from tramadol to MME is 0.1. - Therefore, the total daily dose of tramadol is 60 mg * 2 = 120 mg/day. - The MME for 120 mg of tramadol is 120 mg * 0.1 = 12 MME. Now, let's sum up the MME from all medications: - Hydromorphone: 40 MME - Fentanyl (assuming 40 mcg/hour patches): 6.912 MME - Tramadol: 12 MME Total MME = 40 MME + 6.912 MME + 12 MME = 58.912 MME. If we assume the fentanyl is indeed 40 mg patches (which is highly unusual), we need to find an appropriate conversion. Let's assume the fentanyl patch is 40 mcg/hour. If it's 40 mcg/hour, the daily dose is 40 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 960 mcg/day. The conversion factor is approximately 2.4 MME for every 1000 mcg/day. So, 960 mcg/day * (2.4 MME / 1000 mcg) = 2.304 MME for one patch. Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, the total MME from the fentanyl patches is 2.304 MME/patch * 3 = 6.912 MME. Thus, the total MME is 40 (from hydromorphone) + 6.912 (from fentanyl) + 12 (from tramadol) = 58.912 MME. So the final answer is approximately 58.912 MME. But if the fentanyl is indeed 40 mg patches (which is highly unusual), we need to use a different approach. Let's assume the fentanyl is 40 mg patches. If it's 40 mg patches, and we don't have a standard conversion for such a high dose, we can use the conversion for fentanyl tablets or liquid, which is 100 MME for 1 mg of fentanyl. So, 40 mg of fentanyl * 100 MME/mg = 4000 MME for one patch. Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, the total MME from the fentanyl patches is 4000 MME/patch * 3 = 12000 MME. Thus, the total MME is 40 (from hydromorphone) + 12000 (from fentanyl) + 12 (from tramadol) = 12052 MME. Given the unusual nature of the fentanyl dose, the more likely scenario is that it's a typo and should be 40 mcg/hour. So the final answer is 58.912 MME. Thus the answer is approximately 59 MME. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\n1. **Hydromorphone**: The patient takes 10 mg of hydromorphone once a day.\n - Conversion factor: 1 mg of hydromorphone = 4 MME.\n - Therefore, 10 mg of hydromorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 MME.\n\n2. **Fentanyl Patch**: The patient takes 40 mg of fentanyl patch 3 times a day.\n - This seems unusual because fentanyl patches are typically measured in micrograms (mcg).

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

Since the patient is male, we do not need to apply this adjustment.\\n\\nNow, let's plug in the values:\\nAge = 66 years\\nWeight = 68 kg\\nSerum Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL.\\n\\nUsing the Cockroft-Gault formula:\\nCreatinine Clearance = [(140 - 66) * 68] / (72 * 5.09).\\n\\nCalculate (140 - 66) = 74.\\nThen, 74 * 68 = 5032.\\nNow, calculate the denominator: 72 * 5.09 = 366.48.\\n\\nSo, the Creatinine Clearance = 5032 / 366.48 ≈ 13.73 mL/min.\\n\\nRounded to one decimal place, the Creatinine Clearance is approximately 13.7 mL/min.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '12.949', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 12.949 mL/min.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 65%|██████▌   | 65/100 [2:02:13<55:11, 94.63s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Round maybe 497 ms.</think> Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in milliseconds. The heart rate (HR) is 136 bpm. The formula to calculate the RR interval in milliseconds is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{\text{HR}}. \] Plugging in the heart rate: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{136} \approx 441.176 \, \text{ms}. \] Step 2: Use the Rautaharju formula for the corrected QT interval (QTc): The Rautaharju formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 ms and the RR interval is approximately 441.176 ms, we can plug these values into the formula. First, calculate \(\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}\): \[ \frac{\text{RR}}{1000} = \frac{441.176}{1000} = 0.441176. \] Next, take the square root of this value: \[ \sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}} = \sqrt{0.441176} \approx 0.6642. \] Now, use this result to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc): \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.86. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 497 ms.

Format M/D/Y: 2/25/2021.</think> The other approach is to use the rule of adding 7 days to the last day of the month 3 months prior and then adding a year if necessary. Let's use Naegele's Rule step-by-step: 1. The last menstrual period (LMP) is 05/20/2020. 2. According to Naegele's Rule, the estimated due date (EDD) is calculated by adding 280 days to the LMP. Alternatively, Naegele's Rule can be simplified as follows: - Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP. - Add 9 months to the resulting date. Let's apply this step-by-step: Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP (05/20/2020). 05/20/2020 + 7 days = 05/27/2020. Step 2: Add 9 months to 05/27/2020. Adding 9 months to May 27, 2020: - May + 9 months = February of the next year. - Specifically, May + 9 months = February of the following year because: - May + 1 month = June - May + 2 months = July - May + 3 months = August - May + 4 months = September - May + 5 months = October - May + 6 months = November - May + 7 months = December - May + 8 months = January (of the next year) - May + 9 months = February (of the next year). So, adding 9 months to May 27, 2020, gives us February 27, 2021. Thus, the estimated due date is February 27, 2021. So the due date is 02/27/2021. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we follow these steps:\n1. The LMP is 05/20/2020.\n2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

Step 1: Convert the heart rate (HR) to RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 144 bpm. The RR interval is the time between successive heartbeats. It can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] So, \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{144} = 0.4167 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Framingham formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec and the RR interval is 0.4167 seconds, we plug these values into the formula. First, calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.4167} \approx 0.6455. \] Now, use this to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6455} \approx 511.69. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 512 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 512 msec.

Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP month and subtract 3 months from the LMP month, then add a year if necessary. For the LMP of 04/09/2021: - Add 7 days to the day of the LMP: 9 + 7 = 16. - Subtract 3 months from the month of the LMP: April (4) - 3 = January. Since we subtract 3 months from April, it becomes January of the next year. So the due date for a 28-day cycle would be January 16, 2022. Now, we need to adjust for the cycle length of 25 days instead of the standard 28 days. The adjustment is made by subtracting the difference between the cycle length and 28 days from the due date. Difference = 28 - 25 = 3 days. So, we need to subtract 3 days from the due date calculated using the standard 28-day cycle. January 16, 2022 - 3 days = January 13, 2022. Thus the estimated due date is January 13, 2022. So the final answer is 01/13/2022. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule and adjust for the cycle length of 25 days:\n\nStep 1: Use Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle.\n- The LMP is 04/09/2021.\n- Add 7 days to the day of the LMP: 9 + 7 = 16.\n- Subtract 3 months from the month of the LMP: April (4) - 3 = January.

Step 1: Identify the given values. - Measured sodium (Na+) = 139 mEq/L - Glucose = 129 mg/dL Step 2: Use the formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia: Corrected Na = Measured Na + 1.6 * (Glucose - 100) / 100 Step 3: Plug in the values into the formula.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Here are the conditions mentioned and their respective scores according to the CCI: 1. **Hepatoblastoma**: This is a type of cancer. According to the CCI, "Malignancy (except lymphoma and leukemia)" is scored as 2. However, since the patient has been in remission since the completion of treatment, we need to consider whether it is still active or if it counts. Typically, if it's in remission and not currently active, it might not be counted unless specified otherwise. But for the sake of this calculation, let's assume it's counted as a malignancy since it's part of the patient's history and could have long-term effects. Score = 2. 2. **Leukemia**: According to the CCI, leukemia is scored as 2. Score = 2. 3. **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**: This condition is scored as 1. Score = 1. 4. **Type II Diabetes Mellitus (uncomplicated)**: According to the CCI, diabetes without end-organ damage is scored as 1. Score = 1. 5. **Dementia**: The CCI assigns a score of 1 for dementia. Score = 1. 6. **Severe Liver Disease**: The CCI assigns a score of 3 for cirrhosis or severe liver disease. Score = 3. 7. **Status Post Cerebral Vascular Accident (Stroke)**: According to the CCI, cerebrovascular disease is scored as 1. Score = 1. 8. **Connective Tissue Disease**: The CCI does not have a specific category for connective tissue disease. However, connective tissue diseases can sometimes be grouped under "rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatologic conditions," which is scored as 1. Assuming this is the case here, Score = 1. Now, let's add up the scores for these conditions: - Hepatoblastoma (malignancy): 2 - Leukemia: 2 - Congestive Heart Failure: 1 - Diabetes Mellitus: 1 - Dementia: 1 - Severe Liver Disease: 3 - Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke): 1 - Connective Tissue Disease: 1 Adding these scores together: \[ 2 (Hepatoblastoma) + 2 (Leukemia) + 1 (CHF) + 1 (Diabetes) + 1 (Dementia) + 3 (Severe Liver Disease) + 1 (Stroke) + 1 (Connective Tissue Disease) = 12 \] So the total Charlson Comorbidity Index score is 12.", "answer": "12"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

The patient's weight at admission is 30 kg. Let's break this down step by step: 1. For the first 10 kg: 10 kg * 100 mL/kg = 1000 mL 2. For the next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg): 10 kg * 50 mL/kg = 500 mL 3. For the remaining weight (above 20 kg), which is 30 kg - 20 kg = 10 kg: 10 kg * 20 mL/kg = 200 mL Now, we add these amounts together to get the total daily maintenance fluid requirement: 1000 mL + 500 mL + 200 mL = 1700 mL/day To convert this daily requirement into an hourly rate, we divide by 24 hours: 1700 mL / 24 hours ≈ 70.83 mL/hr Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 71 mL/hr. Therefore, the patient's maintenance fluid requirement is approximately 71 mL/hr.", "answer": "71"}
{'Row Number': 334, 'Calculator Name': 'Maintenance Fluids Calculations', 'Calculator ID': '22', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5970484-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.', 'Question': "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '71', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need maintenance fluid calculation.

THINKING USED We need to compute due date. LMP 03/24/2017. Cycle length 30 days. Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP. But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))? Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP. For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days. Let's compute. March 24, 2017 + 282 days. Compute: 2017 is not leap year? 2017 not leap. Days remaining in March after 24: 31-24=7 days. So after March 31, 7 days used. Remaining days: 282-7=275.

The standard Naegele's Rule adds 280 days to the LMP for a typical 28-day cycle. However, since the cycle length is 30 days, we need to adjust for the longer cycle. The adjustment involves adding the extra days to the due date because a longer cycle means conception occurs later in the cycle. Step 1: Calculate the due date assuming a 28-day cycle. - Add 280 days to the LMP (03/24/2017). Step 2: Adjust for the cycle length difference. Since the cycle is 30 days (which is 2 days longer than the standard 28 days), we need to add these 2 extra days to the due date calculated in Step 1. Let's first calculate the due date for a 28-day cycle: 1. Start with the LMP: 03/24/2017. 2. Add 280 days to 03/24/2017. To do this systematically: - March has 31 days. From March 24 to March 31 is 7 days. - Subtract these 7 days from 280: 280 - 7 = 273 days remaining. Now, we move to April: - April has 30 days. - Subtract 30 days from the remaining 273 days: 273 - 30 = 243 days remaining.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

Typically, ovulation occurs approximately 14 days before the next expected period. If the cycle length is 29 days, the next period would be 29 days after the LMP, which is 10/11/2020 + 29 days. To find the day of ovulation, we subtract 14 days from this next period date. Alternatively, we can calculate the ovulation day directly from the LMP by adding (cycle length - 14) days to the LMP. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation occurs approximately 29 - 14 = 15 days after the LMP. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is around the day of ovulation, which is 10/11/2020 + 15 days. Let's calculate this step by step. 1. LMP = 10/11/2020. 2. Cycle length = 29 days. 3. Ovulation day = LMP + (cycle length - 14) = 10/11/2020 + (29 - 14) = 10/11/2020 + 15 days. Now, let's add 15 days to 10/11/2020. - 10/11/2020 + 15 days: - From 10/11/2020 to 10/31/2020 is 20 days (since 31 - 11 = 20). - But we only need to add 15 days. Adding 15 days to 10/11/2020: - 10/11 + 15 days. Let's count it out: - 10/11 + 20 days = 10/31 (since 11 + 20 = 31, and October has 31 days). - But we need to add only 15 days. If we add 15 days to 10/11/2020: - 10/11 + 10 days = 10/21. - 10/21 + 5 days = 10/26. So, 10/11 + 15 = 10/26. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is 10/26/2020.", "answer": "10/26/2020"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

Delta gap = 20.8-12=8.8 mEq/L.</think> However, the question seems to be asking for the change in the anion gap over time, not the delta gap as defined by the formula. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the initial anion gap. The initial anion gap is given as 20.8 mEq/L. Step 2: Identify the anion gap on day 2 after admission. On day 2, the anion gap is given as 16.2 mEq/L. Step 3: Identify the anion gap on day 3 after admission. On day 3, the anion gap is given as 13.2 mEq/L. The question asks for the patient's delta gap in mEq/L. If we interpret this as the change in the anion gap over time, we need to calculate the difference between the initial anion gap and the subsequent anion gaps. Let's calculate the change in the anion gap from the initial value to the value on day 2: Delta gap (from initial to day 2) = Anion gap (initial) - Anion gap (day 2) = 20.8 mEq/L - 16.2 mEq/L = 4.6 mEq/L. And the change in the anion gap from the initial value to the value on day 3: Delta gap (from initial to day 3) = Anion gap (initial) - Anion gap (day 3) = 20.8 mEq/L - 13.2 mEq/L = 7.6 mEq/L. Since the question does not specify which time point to use for the delta gap, I will assume it is asking for the change from the initial anion gap to the final reported anion gap (which is the one on day 3, as it is the last reported value). So the delta gap is 7.6 mEq/L. Thus, the answer is 7.6 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we need to find the change in the anion gap over time.

After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.\nOn presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L.

Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

<think>We need Child-Pugh score: parameters: encephalopathy grade, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, INR. We have: encephalopathy present (confusion, asterixis, slurred speech) => grade II? but at least II. Assign points: encephalopathy: grade I=1, II=2, III=3, IV=4. So 2 points. Ascites: none mentioned => 0. Bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL: ranges: <2=1, 2-3=2, >3=3. So 1 point. Albumin 3.1 g/dL: ranges: >3.5=1, 2.8-3.5=2, <2.8=3. So 2 points. INR 1.8: ranges: <1.7=1, 1.7-2.3=2, >2.3=3. So 2 points. Total = 2+0+1+2+2 = 7. Child-Pugh class B (7-9). So answer: 7.</think>

During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment.

So answer: 7.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: bilirubin, albumin, INR, encephalopathy, and ascites. Let's break it down step by step using the information provided in the patient note. 1. **Bilirubin**: The total bilirubin count is 1.9 mg/dL. - The Child-Pugh classification for bilirubin is: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3 mg/dL = 3 points - Since the bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range < 2 mg/dL, so it gets 1 point. 2. **Albumin**: The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. - The Child-Pugh classification for albumin is: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - < 2.8 g/dL = 3 points - Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points. 3. **INR**: The INR value is 1.8. - The Child-Pugh classification for INR is: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - > 2.3 = 3 points - Since the INR is 1.8, it falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. 4. **Encephalopathy**: The patient exhibits confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. These symptoms suggest the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. - The Child-Pugh classification for encephalopathy is: - None = 1 point - Grade I-II = 2 points - Grade III-IV = 3 points - The symptoms (confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech) suggest at least Grade II encephalopathy. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 5. **Ascites**: There is no mention of ascites in the patient note. - The Child-Pugh classification for ascites is: - None = 1 point - Controlled = 2 points - Uncontrolled = 3 points - Since there is no mention of ascites, we assume it is none, so it gets 1 point. Now, let's sum up the points from each parameter: - Bilirubin: 1 point - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point Adding these points together: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 8. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - 5-6 points = Class A - 7-9 points = Class B - 10-15 points = Class C Since the score is 8, the patient falls into Class B. Thus, the Child-Pugh score is 8.", "answer": "7"} It seems I made an error in the ascites classification. Let's correct it. The patient note does not mention ascites, so we should assign 1 point for "none." Let's recalculate the total score: - Bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL -> < 2 mg/dL = 1 point. - Albumin: 3.1 g/dL -> 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points. - INR: 1.8 -> 1.7-2.3 = 2 points. - Encephalopathy: Confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech suggest at least Grade II encephalopathy = 2 points. - Ascites: None mentioned = 1 point. Adding these up: 1 (bilirubin) + 2 (albumin) + 2 (INR) + 2 (encephalopathy) + 1 (ascites) = 8 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 8.

Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in seconds from the heart rate. The heart rate is 81 bpm. The RR interval is the time between successive heartbeats. Since the heart rate is the number of beats per minute, the RR interval in seconds is given by: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate}} = \frac{60}{81} \approx 0.7407 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Framingham formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec and the RR interval is approximately 0.7407 seconds, we need to calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.7407} \approx 0.8606. \] Now, plug in the values into the Framingham formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.8606} \approx 383.5. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 384 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 384 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula, we follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the RR interval from the heart rate. The heart rate is 81 bpm. The RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds: $RR = \\frac{60}{81} \\approx 0.7407$ seconds.\n2. Use the Framingham formula for the corrected QT interval, which is $QTc = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt{RR}}$. Here, the QT interval is 330 msec and the RR interval is approximately 0.7407 seconds.\n3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention.

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

He is presently on mechanical ventilation, with FiO₂ at 54 %, and his arterial blood gas shows a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. Furthermore, there are ongoing infusions of multiple vasopressors to maintain his hemodynamic stability, including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. His systolic and diastolic blood pressure recorded at 120 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg, respectively. Biochemical findings show creatinine measurement at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function, while the bilirubin level stood at 2.3 mg/dL. His platelet count is 175,000/µL.

The SOFA scoring for platelets is as follows:\n- >150,000 = 0 points\n- 100,000-150,000 = 1 point\n- 50,000-99,000 = 2 points\n- 20,000-49,000 = 3 points\n- <20,000 = 4 points\nSince the platelet count is 175,000, which is greater than 150,000, it corresponds to 0 points.\n\nCorrection: I made an error. The correct scoring for platelets is:\n- >150,000 = 0 points\n- 100,000-150,000 = 1 point\n- 50,000-99,000 = 2 points\n- 20,000-49,000 = 3 points\n- <20,000 = 4 points.\nSince the platelet count is 175,000, which is between 150,000 and 200,000, it should be 0 points. But the correct range for 150,000-200,000 is actually within the >150,000 range, so it's 0 points.\n\nSo, the correct score for platelets is 0 points.\n\n3. **Liver (Bilirubin):** The bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL. The SOFA scoring for bilirubin is as follows:\n- <1.2 = 0 points\n- 1.2-1.9 = 1 point\n- 2.0-5.9 = 2 points\n- 6.0-11.9 = 3 points\n- ≥12 = 4 points\nSince the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls within the range 2.0-5.9, corresponding to 2 points.\n\n4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Use):** We need to calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and consider the vasopressor use.\nMAP can be calculated using the formula: MAP ≈ (2 * diastolic + systolic) / 3. Given systolic BP = 120 mmHg and diastolic BP = 75 mmHg, we have:\nMAP = (2 * 75 + 120) / 3 = (150 + 120) / 3 = 270 / 3 = 90 mmHg.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the vasopressor use. The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min.\n\nThe SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system is based on both MAP and vasopressor use:\n- If MAP is ≥ 70 mmHg and no vasopressors are used, the score is 0.\n- If MAP is <70 mmHg and no vasopressors are used, the score is 1.\n- If vasopressors are used to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mmHg, the score depends on the type and dose of vasopressors.\n\nThe scoring for vasopressors is as follows:\n- If MAP ≥ 70 mmHg and no vasopressors are used: 0 points.\n- If MAP ≥ 70 mmHg and vasopressors are used: \n - Noradrenaline or adrenaline < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 1 point.\n - Noradrenaline or adrenaline 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min: 2 points.\n - Noradrenaline or adrenaline > 0.5 mcg/kg/min or any dose of vasopressin: 3 points.\n - If MAP < 70 mmHg, regardless of vasopressors: 4 points.\n\nSince the MAP is 90 mmHg (which is ≥ 70 mmHg), we need to evaluate the vasopressors.\n\nThe patient is using:\n- NorEPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min.\n- EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min.\n- DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min.\n- DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min.\n\nDOPamine and DOBUTamine are not included in the vasopressor scoring for SOFA unless they exceed certain thresholds. For the purpose of SOFA scoring, we primarily consider noradrenaline (norEPINEPHrine) and adrenaline (EPINEPHrine).\n\nThe total dose of noradrenaline and adrenaline is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mcg/kg/min.\n\nAccording to the SOFA scoring for vasopressors:\n- Noradrenaline or adrenaline < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 1 point.\n- Noradrenaline or adrenaline 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min: 2 points.\n- Noradrenaline or adrenaline > 0.5 mcg/kg/min or any dose of vasopressin: 3 points.\n\nSince the total dose of noradrenaline and adrenaline is 0.2 mcg/kg/min (which falls within the range 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min), the score for the cardiovascular component is 2 points.\n\n5. **Renal (Creatinine):** The creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL. The SOFA scoring for creatinine is as follows:\n- <1.2 = 0 points\n- 1.2-1.9 = 1 point\n- 2.0-3.4 = 2 points\n- 3.5-4.9 = 3 points\n- ≥5 = 4 points\nSince the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls within the range 1.2-1.9, corresponding to 1 point.\n\n6. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Scale):** The GCS score is 10. The SOFA scoring for the CNS component based on GCS is as follows:\n- GCS 15 = 0 points\n- GCS 13-14 = 1 point\n- GCS 9-12 = 2 points\n- GCS 6-8 = 3 points\n- GCS ≤ 5 = 4 points\nSince the GCS score is 10, it falls within the range 9-12, corresponding to 2 points.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the scores from each component:\n- Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂): 3 points\n- Hematological (Platelets): 0 points\n- Liver (Bilirubin): 2 points\n- Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressors): 2 points\n- Renal (Creatinine): 1 point\n- CNS (GCS): 2 points\n\nAdding these up: 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10 points.\n\nThus, the total SOFA score is 10.\n\nSo the final answer is 10.", "answer": "10"}

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

The given weight is 100 kg and the height is 172 cm. Let's plug these values into the formula step by step. Step 1: Calculate weight(kg)^0.425. weight = 100 kg weight^0.425 = 100^0.425 Using logarithms for easier calculation: ln(100) ≈ 4.60517 Now multiply this by 0.425: 4.60517 * 0.425 ≈ 1.9574 Now take the exponential of this result to get back to the original base: exp(1.9574) ≈ 7.07 So, 100^0.425 ≈ 7.07. Step 2: Calculate height(cm)^0.725. height = 172 cm height^0.725 = 172^0.725 Using logarithms for this calculation: ln(172) ≈ 5.1478 Now multiply this by 0.725: 5.1478 * 0.725 ≈ 3.735 Now take the exponential of this result: exp(3.735) ≈ 41.8 So, 172^0.725 ≈ 41.8.

BSA = 0.007184 * (100^0.425) * (172^0.725) ≈ 0.007184 * 7.07 * 41.8 First, multiply 7.07 * 41.8: 7.07 * 41.8 ≈ 296.026 Now multiply this result by 0.007184: 0.007184 * 296.026 ≈ 2.12 Therefore, the BSA is approximately 2.12 m².", "answer": "1.9"} It seems I made an error in the final calculation. Let's redo the last part more carefully.

Let's use a calculator for a more precise calculation. Using the formula directly with the given values: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times (100)^{0.425} \times (172)^{0.725} \] Using a calculator: \[ 100^{0.425} \approx 7.071 \] \[ 172^{0.725} \approx 41.79 \] Now multiply these results: \[ 7.071 \times 41.79 \approx 296.0 \] Then multiply by 0.007184: \[ 0.007184 \times 296.0 \approx 2.13 \] Thus the BSA is approximately 2.13 m².

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well. Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail. The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations. Here is the task: What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

Here none present. So score 0.</think> Upon analyzing the patient note, we can apply the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism to determine the score. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: List the Wells' criteria for PE and their corresponding points: - Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT (swelling, pain along the distribution of the deep veins, increased local temperature, dilatation of superficial veins, positive Homans' sign): +3 points - Alternative diagnosis less likely than PE: +3 points - Heart rate > 100 bpm: +1.5 points - Immobilization for >3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks: +1.5 points - Previous DVT or PE: +1.5 points - Hemoptysis: +1 point - Malignancy (treatment within the last 6 months or palliative): +1 point Step 2: Evaluate the patient note against each criterion: 1. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT: The patient is described as asymptomatic. There is no mention of any swelling, pain, or other signs of DVT. Score: 0 points. 2. Alternative diagnosis less likely than PE: The patient was admitted due to a chest x-ray showing a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region, which led to the discovery of a type B dissection. This suggests that the primary diagnosis is not PE but rather aortic dissection. Therefore, an alternative diagnosis (aortic dissection) is more likely than PE. Score: 0 points. 3. Heart rate > 100 bpm: The note mentions that the resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score: 0 points. 4. Immobilization for >3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks: There is no mention of recent immobilization or surgery in the patient note. Score: 0 points. 5. Previous DVT or PE: No information about a history of DVT or PE is provided. Score: 0 points. 6. Hemoptysis: The patient is asymptomatic and there is no mention of hemoptysis. Score: 0 points. 7. Malignancy (treatment within the last 6 months or palliative): No information about malignancy is provided. Score: 0 points. Adding up all the scores from the criteria, we get: 0 (DVT signs) + 0 (alternative diagnosis) + 0 (heart rate > 100) + 0 (immobilization/surgery) + 0 (previous DVT/PE) + 0 (hemoptysis) + 0 (malignancy) = 0 points. Therefore, the patient's score on the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "Upon analyzing the patient note, we apply the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism step-by-step. The patient is asymptomatic, with no signs of DVT, no elevated heart rate, no recent immobilization or surgery, no history of DVT or PE, no hemoptysis, and no information about malignancy. The primary diagnosis is aortic dissection, making an alternative diagnosis more likely than PE. Thus, none of the criteria are met, leading to a score of 0.", "answer": "0"}

 Here is the patient note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a known history of cirrhosis due to chronic Hepatitis B infection. Upon clinical examination, he has jaundice and his abdomen is moderately distended with a noticeable fluid wave on palpation, indicating moderate ascites. He has been experiencing episodes of short-term memory loss and confusion, consistent with grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. His laboratory results reflected impaired coagulation status given INR of 1.9. Overall liver function tests showed albumin level of 2.8 g/dL and total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL. His hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL, and other routine biochemical parameters were within acceptable range. His medication list includes diuretics, lactulose, and antiviral agents for ongoing Hepatitis B infection. The patient and his family have been advised to monitor his cognitive function at home and relay any further deterioration.

This falls into the range of 2-3 mg/dL, so it gets 3 points. 2. **Albumin (g/dL):** - >3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.7: 3 points - <2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 2.8 g/dL. This falls into the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points. 3. **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.9. This falls into the range of 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points The patient has moderate ascites. This corresponds to "Moderate to Severe," so it gets 3 points. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 1 point - Grade 2: 2 points - Grade 3: 3 points - Grade 4: 4 points The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Since grade 1 and grade 2 both get 1 and 2 points respectively, and the note says "grade 1-2," we'll take the higher value within this range for the worst-case scenario within the given range. Grade 1 gets 1 point, and Grade 2 gets 2 points. Let's assume the patient has Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy for the lower score, which is 1 point. If it's Grade 2, it would be 2 points. Let's calculate both scenarios: Scenario 1: If the patient has Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy. - Encephalopathy: 1 point Scenario 2: If the patient has Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy. - Encephalopathy: 2 points Now, let's calculate the total score for both scenarios. For Scenario 1 (Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy): - Total Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 1 point Total Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11 points. For Scenario 2 (Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy): - Total Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12 points. It seems there was a mistake in the initial thinking. Let's correct the parameters and their corresponding points based on the given information. Given: - Encephalopathy: Grade 1-2 (we'll take the higher value for the worst-case scenario, which is Grade 2, so 2 points). - Ascites: Moderate (2 points for moderate ascites). - Bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dL (This falls into the range 2-3 mg/dL, so it gets 3 points). - Albumin: 2.8 g/dL (This falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points). - INR: 1.9 (This falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points). Now let's sum up the points: - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. - Ascites (moderate): 2 points. - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points. - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points. - INR (1.9): 2 points. Total Child-Pugh Score = 2 (Encephalopathy) + 2 (Ascites) + 3 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) = 11 points. Now, let's classify the Child-Pugh score: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 11 points, it falls into Child-Pugh Class C. But let's recheck the ascites classification. Moderate ascites is classified as 2 points. So the correct points are: - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. - Ascites (moderate): 2 points. - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points. - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points. - INR (1.9): 2 points. Total = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11. It seems I made an error in the ascites classification. Moderate ascites is actually classified as 2 points. Let's try another approach by using the correct ranges and classifications. 1. **Total Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - <1.0: 1 point - 1.0-1.9: 2 points - 2.0-5.9: 3 points - >5.9: 4 points The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. This falls into the range 2.0-5.9, so it gets 3 points. 2. **Albumin (g/dL):** - >3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.7: 3 points - <2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 2.8 g/dL. This falls into the range 2.8-3.5, so it gets 2 points. 3. **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.9. This falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points The patient has moderate ascites. This corresponds to "Moderate to Severe," so it gets 3 points. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 1 point - Grade 2: 2 points - Grade 3: 3 points - Grade 4: 4 points The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Let's take the higher value within this range, which is Grade 2, so it gets 2 points. Now, let's sum up the points: - Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 12, which corresponds to Child-Pugh Class C. It seems I made an error in the ascites classification. Let's correct it. The correct classification for ascites is: - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points Since the patient has moderate ascites, it should be classified as "Moderate to Severe," which is 3 points. So the correct points are: - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points - INR (1.9): 2 points - Ascites (moderate): 2 points (since moderate is considered mild to moderate in some classifications, but let's use the given information that moderate is 2 points). - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. Let's sum up the points with the correct ascites classification (moderate = 2 points): - Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 2 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 11, which corresponds to Child-Pugh Class C. Thus the final score is 11. Assistant {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following parameters and assign points to each parameter: 1. **Total Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - <1.0: 1 point - 1.0-1.9: 2 points - 2.0-5.9: 3 points - >5.9: 4 points The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL.

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician with a 4-month history of chest pain that occurs on exertion. The pain is dull, and she experiences retrosternal pressure when she walks up the stairs to her apartment on the fifth floor. The pain disappears shortly after stopping for one minute. She has hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril and metoprolol daily. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her pulse is 72/min and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Fasting lipid studies show:
Total cholesterol 196 mg/dL
LDL 110 mg/dL
HDL 50 mg/dL

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Not mentioned. So score 2 (Hypertension + Age). Output.</think> To calculate the HAS-BLED score for this patient, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the HAS-BLED scoring system. The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those on anticoagulation therapy. It includes the following components: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg) = 1 point - A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function = 1 point - S: Stroke = 1 point - B: Bleeding history or predisposition = 1 point - L: Labile INR (if on warfarin) = 1 point - E: Elderly (>65 years) = 1 point - D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly = 1 point Now let's evaluate each component based on the given patient information: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg)** - The patient's recent BP measurement is 164/113 mmHg. - Since both SBP (164 mmHg) > 160 mmHg and DBP (113 mmHg) > 100 mmHg, this criterion is met. - Score for H = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function** - The note states that there are no predominant signs of renal impairment, as witnessed by normal creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate. - No information about liver function is provided. - Since renal function is normal and liver function is not mentioned (and thus assumed not abnormal unless stated otherwise), we will assume this criterion is not met. - Score for A = 0. 3. **S: Stroke** - The patient has a history of stroke. - This criterion is met. - Score for S = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes. - No predisposition to bleeding is mentioned. - This criterion is not met. - Score for B = 0. 5. **L: Labile INR (if on warfarin)** - The note mentions that the coagulation profiles including INR have consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. - This criterion is not met. - Score for L = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (>65 years)** - The patient is 70 years old. - This criterion is met. - Score for E = 1. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly** - The patient denies alcohol consumption, reporting zero drinks per week. - No information about concomitant drugs that increase bleeding risk (like NSAIDs) is provided. - Since the patient does not consume alcohol and no other drugs are mentioned that would increase the risk, this criterion is not met. - Score for D = 0. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - H = 1 - A = 0 - S = 1 - B = 0 - L = 0 - E = 1 - D = 0 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3. So the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we evaluate each component based on the given information:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

The formula for the anion gap is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). Step 2: Calculate the delta gap. The delta gap is the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate from the anion gap. Step 3: Correct the delta gap for albumin. Let's use the initial laboratory values from the patient's presentation: - Serum sodium (Na): 135 mmol/L - Serum chloride (Cl): 110 mmol/L - Serum bicarbonate (HCO3): 18 mmol/L Step 1: Calculate the anion gap (AG). AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3) AG = 135 - (110 + 18) AG = 135 - 128 AG = 7 mEq/L Step 2: Calculate the delta gap. The delta gap is defined as the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate from the anion gap. The formula for the calculated bicarbonate is: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (AG - 12) Using the AG we just calculated (7 mEq/L): Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (7 - 12) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (-5) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 + 5 Calculated bicarbonate = 29 mEq/L Now, the delta gap is the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate: Delta gap = Measured bicarbonate - Calculated bicarbonate Delta gap = 18 - 29 Delta gap = -11 mEq/L Step 3: Correct the delta gap for albumin. The formula to correct the delta gap for albumin is to add 2.5 mEq/L for each gram per deciliter (g/dL) that the albumin is below the normal range. The normal range for albumin is 3.4-4.2 g/dL. The patient's albumin level is 1.2 g/dL. The albumin deficit is: Albumin deficit = Normal albumin - Patient's albumin Albumin deficit = 4.0 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL = 2.8 g/dL (using the midpoint of the normal range, 4.0 g/dL for simplicity). Now, we correct the delta gap by adding 2.5 mEq/L for each g/dL that the albumin is below the normal range: Corrected delta gap = Delta gap + (2.5 * Albumin deficit) Corrected delta gap = -11 + (2.5 * 2.8) Corrected delta gap = -11 + 7 Corrected delta gap = -4 mEq/L So the albumin-corrected delta gap is -4 mEq/L. However, it seems I made an incorrect approach to the delta gap calculation. Let's use the alternative approach to calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap. The delta gap is defined as the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate from the anion gap. The anion gap (AG) is calculated as: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3) AG = 135 - (110 + 18) AG = 135 - 128 AG = 7 mEq/L The formula to calculate the corrected bicarbonate is: Corrected bicarbonate = Measured bicarbonate + 0.25 * (Normal albumin - Patient's albumin) Using the normal albumin range midpoint of 4.0 g/dL and the patient's albumin of 1.2 g/dL: Albumin deficit = 4.0 - 1.2 = 2.8 g/dL Corrected bicarbonate = 18 + 0.25 * 2.8 Corrected bicarbonate = 18 + 0.7 Corrected bicarbonate = 18.7 mEq/L Now, the delta gap is the difference between the corrected bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate from the anion gap. The calculated bicarbonate from the anion gap is: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (AG - 12) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (7 - 12) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (-5) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 + 5 Calculated bicarbonate = 29 mEq/L So the delta gap is: Delta gap = Corrected bicarbonate - Calculated bicarbonate Delta gap = 18.7 - 29 Delta gap = -10.3 mEq/L Thus the albumin-corrected delta gap is -10.3 mEq/L. It seems there was a mix-up in the approach. Let's use the simpler approach to calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap. The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: Corrected AG = AG + 2.5 * (Normal albumin - Patient's albumin) Using the normal albumin range midpoint of 4.0 g/dL and the patient's albumin of 1.2 g/dL: Albumin deficit = 4.0 - 1.2 = 2.8 g/dL Corrected AG = 7 + 2.5 * 2.8 Corrected AG = 7 + 7 Corrected AG = 14 mEq/L Now, the delta gap is the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate from the corrected anion gap. The formula for the calculated bicarbonate from the corrected anion gap is: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (Corrected AG - 12) Using the corrected AG of 14 mEq/L: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (14 - 12) Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - 2 Calculated bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L Now the delta gap is: Delta gap = Measured bicarbonate - Calculated bicarbonate Delta gap = 18 - 22 Delta gap = -4 mEq/L So the albumin-corrected delta gap is -4 mEq/L. Thus the final answer is -4 mEq/L. Assistant: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we need to use the initial laboratory values from the patient's presentation. The values are: Na = 135 mmol/L, Cl = 110 mmol/L, HCO3 = 18 mmol/L, and Albumin = 1.2 g/dL. The normal range for albumin is 3.4-4.2 g/dL. Let's calculate the anion gap (AG) first. The formula for the anion gap is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). Plugging in the values, we get: AG = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 mEq/L. Next, we calculate the calculated bicarbonate using the formula: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (AG - 12). Using the AG we just calculated (7 mEq/L), we get: Calculated bicarbonate = 24 - (7 - 12) = 24 - (-5) = 24 + 5 = 29 mEq/L. The delta gap is the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the calculated bicarbonate: Delta gap = Measured bicarbonate - Calculated bicarbonate = 18 - 29 = -11 mEq/L. Now, we need to correct this delta gap for the albumin level. The albumin deficit is the difference between the normal albumin level and the patient's albumin level. Using the midpoint of the normal range for albumin (3.8 g/dL), the albumin deficit is: Albumin deficit = 3.8 - 1.2 = 2.6 g/dL. The correction for the delta gap due to albumin is 2.5 mEq/L for each g/dL that the albumin is below the normal range. So the correction is: Correction = 2.5 * Albumin deficit = 2.5 * 2.6 = 6.5 mEq/L. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta gap is: Corrected delta gap = Delta gap + Correction = -11 + 6.5 = -4.5 mEq/L. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the albumin-corrected delta gap is approximately -5 mEq/L. However, if we use the midpoint of the normal range for albumin as 4.0 g/dL, the albumin deficit is: Albumin deficit = 4.0 - 1.2 = 2.8 g/dL. The correction is: Correction = 2.5 * 2.8 = 7 mEq/L. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta gap is: Corrected delta gap = -11 + 7 = -4 mEq/L. So the albumin-corrected delta gap is -4 mEq/L.", "answer": "-4"}

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L).

His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3).

Thus, we need to add 13 days to the LMP (08/22/2014) to find the estimated date of conception.\n\nLet's add 13 days to 08/22/2014.\n\n1. From 08/22/2014 to the end of August: August has 31 days. So, the number of days remaining in August after 08/22 is 31 - 22 = 9 days.\n2. Subtract these 9 days from the 13 days we need to add. 13 - 9 = 4 days.\n3. Therefore, after adding the 9 days to reach the end of August (which is 08/31), we have 4 more days to add. Adding these 4 days to September gives us 09/04/2014.\n\nSo, 08/22 + 9 days = 08/31, and then adding the remaining 4 days to September gives us 09/04.\n\nThus, the estimated date of conception is 09/04/2014.", "answer": "09/04/2014"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

HEART score 6 = moderate risk.</think> However, it seems I need to clarify the components and scoring for the HEART score. The HEART score is used to assess the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients presenting with chest pain. It consists of the following components: - **H (History):** 0 points for typical chest pain, 1 point for atypical chest pain, and 2 points for non-chest pain. - **E (ECG):** 0 points for normal or non-diagnostic changes, 1 point for non-specific ST-T changes, and 2 points for diagnostic ST-T changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). - **A (Age):** 0 points if <65 years old, 1 point if ≥65 years old. - **R (Risk factors):** 0 points if no risk factors, 1 point if one risk factor, and 2 points if two or more risk factors. Risk factors include: diabetes, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and family history of premature coronary artery disease. - **T (Troponin):** 0 points if normal, 1 point if elevated but <0.3 ng/mL, and 2 points if elevated ≥0.3 ng/mL. Let's calculate the HEART score step by step for this patient: 1. **History (H):** The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is typically sharp and worsens with deep breaths or coughing, which is not typical for ACS. Therefore, this is considered atypical or non-typical chest pain. The score for history is 1 point. 2. **ECG (E):** The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. Low voltage is a non-specific finding. Therefore, the ECG is considered to have non-specific changes. The score for ECG is 1 point. 3. **Age (A):** The patient is 47 years old. Since he is younger than 65 years old, the score for age is 0 points. 4. **Risk factors (R):** The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These are two risk factors for coronary artery disease. Therefore, the score for risk factors is 2 points. 5. **Troponin (T):** The initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml, which is above the reference range (<0.012 ng/ml), and it is also above 0.3 ng/ml. Therefore, the score for troponin is 2 points. Now, we add up all the scores: - History (H): 1 point - ECG (E): 1 point - Age (A): 0 points - Risk factors (R): 2 points - Troponin (T): 2 points Total HEART score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6. The HEART score of 6 indicates a moderate to high risk for acute coronary syndrome. Thus, the patient's HEART score is 6. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score for the patient, we need to evaluate each component of the HEART score: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin.\n\n1. **History (H):** The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath.
