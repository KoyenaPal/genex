 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

This scores 1 point. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal Function):** The note mentions that the patient has an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate, indicating abnormal renal function. This scores 1 point. 3. **S (Abnormal Liver Function):** The patient has a history of hepatic impairment due to ALD (alcoholic liver disease), which indicates abnormal liver function. This scores 1 point. 4. **B (Bleeding):** There is no mention of any history of bleeding episodes or being on medications that increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, this scores 0 points. 5. **L (Lab INR > 3):** The note states that the patient's coagulation profiles are quite stable, with a consistently normal INR. Therefore, this scores 0 points. 6. **D (Drugs or Alcohol):** The patient admits to consuming alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. This indicates alcohol consumption, which scores 1 point. 7. **E (Old Age):** The patient is 72 years old. If the definition of "old age" for the HAS-BLED score is considered to be over 65 years, this would score 1 point. Now let's sum up the points for each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal Renal Function): 1 point - S (Abnormal Liver Function): 1 point - B (Bleeding): 0 points - L (Lab INR > 3): 0 points - D (Drugs or Alcohol): 1 point - E (Old Age): 1 point Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 1 (S) + 0 (B) + 0 (L) + 1 (D) + 1 (E) = 5 points. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we need to evaluate each component based on the given information:\n\n1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has uncontrolled hypertension.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative. Here is the task: What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the Framingham Risk Score, the formula is: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (age - 10)^3 Given the patient is 50 years old: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (50 - 10)^3 = 10 - 40^3 = 10 - 64000 = 10 </think> But it seems I made an incorrect approach. The Framingham Risk Score is actually calculated using a more complex formula that takes into account age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking status, and diabetes status. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the required information from the patient note. - Age: 50 years old - Sex: Male - Smoking history: 3-pack year smoking history (implies he is a smoker) - Blood pressure: 131/83 mm Hg - Cholesterol levels: LDL = 107 mg/dL, HDL = 43 mg/dL, triglycerides = 98 mg/dL We need to calculate the total cholesterol. The formula for total cholesterol is approximately: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5) Using the given values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL - Diabetes status: The patient denies a history of diabetes, so no diabetes. Now we have the following information for the Framingham Risk Score calculation: - Age: 50 years - Sex: Male - Total Cholesterol: 169.6 mg/dL - HDL: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg - Smoking: Yes - Diabetes: No Step 2: Use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men. The Framingham Risk Score for men is calculated using the following points system: Points for Age: - 50 years: 9 Points for Total Cholesterol (mg/dL): - 160-199: 4 Since 169.6 falls within the range of 160-199, the points are 4. Points for HDL (mg/dL): - 40-49: 0 Since the HDL is 43 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 40-49, so the points are 0. Points for Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg): If the patient is on medication for high blood pressure, use the points for the treated blood pressure category. If not on medication, use the points for the untreated category. Since there's no mention of the patient being on blood pressure medication, we'll assume he is not on medication. For systolic blood pressure: - 120-129: 1 - 130-139: 2 Since the systolic BP is 131 mm Hg, it falls within the range of 130-139, so the points are 2. Points for Smoking: - Current smoker: 2 Since the patient has a smoking history and is likely a current smoker (given the 3-pack year history), the points are 2. Points for Diabetes: - No diabetes: 0 Since the patient has no history of diabetes, the points are 0. Now, let's add up all the points: Points for Age: 9 Points for Total Cholesterol: 4 Points for HDL: 0 Points for Systolic Blood Pressure: 2 Points for Smoking: 2 Points for Diabetes: 0 Total Points = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 17 Step 3: Convert the total points to a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease using the Framingham Risk Score table or formula. For a total score of 17 for a 50-year-old male, we can use the Framingham Risk Score table or the formula to convert the points to a percentage risk. Using the Framingham Risk Score table or the formula, the 10-year risk for a 50-year-old male with 17 points is approximately 10%. So the Framingham Risk Score for this patient is approximately 10%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Framingham Risk Score, we need the following information from the patient note: Age: 50 years old, Sex: Male, Smoking history: Yes (3-pack year smoking history), Blood pressure: 131/83 mm Hg, Cholesterol levels: LDL = 107 mg/dL, HDL = 43 mg/dL, triglycerides = 98 mg/dL. We calculated the total cholesterol as approximately 169.6 mg/dL. The patient has no diabetes. Using the Framingham Risk Score points system for men, we assign points as follows: Points for Age (50 years): 9, Points for Total Cholesterol (169.6 mg/dL, which falls in the range 160-199): 4, Points for HDL (43 mg/dL, which falls in the range 40-49): 0, Points for Systolic Blood Pressure (131 mm Hg, which falls in the range 130-139): 2, Points for Smoking (current smoker): 2, and Points for Diabetes (no diabetes): 0.

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.

Adding these points together gives us a total of 17 points. Using the Framingham Risk Score table or formula, a total score of 17 for a 50-year-old male corresponds to approximately a 10% 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

The patient's heart rate is 95 bpm, which is not tachycardia (HR > 100), so the tachycardia score is 0. The respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is not tachypnea (RR ≥ 20), so the tachypnea score is 0. Let's recalculate the APACHE II score step-by-step using the correct information: 1. **Age**: 60 years old = 3 points. 2. **Heart Rate**: 95 bpm (not > 100) = 0 points. 3. **Respiratory Rate**: 19 breaths per minute (not ≥ 20) = 0 points. 4. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: We need to calculate the MAP from the given blood pressure (135/75 mmHg). The formula for MAP is: MAP = (SBP + 2 * DBP) / 3. So, MAP = (135 + 2 * 75) / 3 = (135 + 150) / 3 = 285 / 3 = 95 mmHg. Since the MAP is not below 70 mmHg, there is no score for hypotension. 5. **Temperature**: 37.2°C. Since it is within the normal range (36-38°C), the temperature score is 0. 6. **Arterial pH**: The arterial blood gas pH is 7.32. We need to find the pH score. The APACHE II scoring system uses the following pH categories: - pH < 7.30: 2 points - pH 7.30-7.34: 1 point - pH 7.35-7.45: 0 points - pH > 7.45: 1 point Since the pH is 7.32, it falls into the category of pH 7.30-7.34, so the score is 1 point. 7. **PaCO₂**: The A-a gradient is given as 364, but we need the PaCO₂ to calculate the respiratory score. However, the A-a gradient is not directly used in the APACHE II scoring system. We need the PaCO₂ value from the ABG. Since it's not provided directly, let's assume we have to use the pH score instead for respiratory function. 8. **Serum Sodium**: 138 mmol/L. The normal range for sodium is typically 135-145 mmol/L. Since 138 is within the normal range, the score for sodium is 0. 9. **Serum Potassium**: Not used in the APACHE II score. 10. **Creatinine**: 3.8 mg/dL. The APACHE II scoring system for creatinine is as follows: - Creatinine < 1.2 mg/dL: 0 points - 1.2-1.9 mg/dL: 1 point - 2.0-2.9 mg/dL: 2 points - 3.0-4.9 mg/dL: 3 points - ≥ 5.0 mg/dL: 4 points Since the creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL, it falls into the 3.0-4.9 mg/dL range, so the score is 3 points. 11. **WBC Count**: 12,000 cells/µL. The APACHE II scoring system for WBC is as follows: - WBC < 4,000 or > 12,000: 1 point - 4,000-12,000: 0 points Since the WBC count is exactly 12,000, it is on the boundary. According to the APACHE II scoring system, if the WBC is > 12,000, it gets a score of 1 point. Since the WBC is exactly 12,000, it is considered to be in the > 12,000 category, so the score is 1 point. 12. **Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)**: The patient has a GCS of 14, which corresponds to mild confusion. The APACHE II scoring system for GCS is as follows: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 13-14: 1 point - GCS 9-12: 2 points - GCS 5-8: 3 points - GCS < 5: 4 points Since the GCS is 14, the score is 1 point.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly. It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney. A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease. On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity. The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks.

The general form of the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for females is: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-1.174} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] But since the patient's age is given as 38 years old and the serum creatinine is 8.9 mg/dL, let's use the formula step by step. 1. Convert the serum creatinine from mg/dL to μmol/L because the CKD-EPI equation uses μmol/L for creatinine. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 88.4 μmol/L. So, \[ \text{Creatinine in μmol/L} = 8.9 \times 88.4 = 786.76 \, \mu \text{mol/L}. \] Now, we will use the CKD-EPI equation for females: \[ GFR = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-1.174} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}}. \] Plugging in the values: - Creatinine = 786.76 μmol/L - Age = 38 years First, calculate \(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\): \[ \frac{786.76}{0.7} = 1123.942857. \] Now, calculate \(\left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-1.174}\): \[ \left(1123.942857\right)^{-1.174}. \] Using a calculator: \[ \left(1123.942857\right)^{-1.174} \approx 0.000031. \] Next, calculate \(0.993^{\text{Age}}\): \[ 0.993^{38}. \] Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.898. \] Now, plug these values into the GFR formula: \[ GFR = 144 \times 0.000031 \times 0.898. \] Calculate step by step: \[ 144 \times 0.000031 = 0.004464. \] Then, \[ 0.004464 \times 0.898 \approx 0.004. \] So the GFR is approximately 4 mL/min/1.73m². Thus, the patient's GFR is approximately 4 mL/min/1.73m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need to convert the serum creatinine from mg/dL to μmol/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma (). Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer. Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months. Here is the task: What is the patient's FeverPAIN score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the FeverPAIN score, the formula is: FeverPAIN = 3 if the patient has a temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) </think> + 2 if the patient has pain or abdominal pain </think> + 1 if the patient has altered mental status </think> + 1 if the patient has tachycardia (heart rate > 100 bpm) </think> + 1 if the patient has hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mmHg or systolic BP < 100 mmHg in patients with hypertension) </think>. Let's break this down step-by-step using the information provided in the patient note. Step 1: Check for Fever (Temperature > 100.4°F or 38°C). The patient note does not provide the patient's temperature. Therefore, we cannot add points for fever. Step 2: Check for Pain or Abdominal Pain. The patient presented with nausea and vomiting and felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat. He also experienced abdominal pain, as indicated by the statement "The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival." However, the note mentions that the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain upon arrival at the tertiary center. Since the patient did report abdominal pain initially, we can consider this as a positive for pain or abdominal pain. Therefore, we add 2 points. Step 3: Check for Altered Mental Status. The patient note does not mention any signs of altered mental status. Therefore, we do not add any points for altered mental status. Step 4: Check for Tachycardia (heart rate > 100 bpm). The patient's pulse was 65 beats per minute. Since the pulse is not above 100 bpm, we do not add any points for tachycardia. Step 5: Check for Hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mmHg or systolic BP < 100 mmHg in patients with hypertension). The patient's blood pressure was 157/84 mmHg. Since the systolic blood pressure (157 mmHg) is not below 90 mmHg or below 100 mmHg (considering the patient has a history of hypertension), we do not add any points for hypotension. Now, let's sum up the points: - Fever: No information provided, so 0 points. - Pain or Abdominal Pain: Yes, so +2 points. - Altered Mental Status: No, so 0 points. - Tachycardia: No, so 0 points. - Hypotension: No, so 0 points. Therefore, the FeverPAIN score is 2. The final answer is 2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to check the following criteria:\n1. Fever (Temperature > 100.4°F or 38°C): No information provided, so 0 points.\n2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

Since the problem doesn't provide fasting insulin levels, I'll assume that the given information includes the change in insulin levels after treatment. From the information provided: "After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17 mg/dl), insulin (−26 uIU/ml), and TG (−12 mg/dl)." This means that the fasting glucose decreased by 17 mg/dL from some previous value, and the fasting insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL from some previous value. To calculate the HOMA-IR, we need the fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels at the time of this measurement. Let's use the fasting glucose level given for the time when HbA1c was 8.3%, which is 163 mg/dL (since it says "FG (−17 mg/dl)" likely refers to the change from an earlier value). Let's denote the fasting insulin level as \( I \). The change in insulin is given as -26 uIU/mL. This means the insulin level decreased by 26 uIU/mL from some initial value. Without the initial insulin level, we can't directly calculate the current insulin level. However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the HOMA-IR score based on the information provided and the change in insulin, we can use the change to infer the new insulin level if we had the initial insulin level. Let's denote the initial fasting insulin level as \( I_{initial} \). The current fasting insulin level would be \( I_{current} = I_{initial} - 26 \). Since the problem does not provide the initial insulin level, we cannot calculate the exact HOMA-IR score directly from the information given. But let's try another approach using the information provided at the time of the preoperative evaluation. At the initial preoperative evaluation, the weight was 129.3 kg, height was 154.5 cm, and BMI was 54.2 kg/m2. The laboratory values were: HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210 mg/dL. If we had the fasting insulin level at this time, we could calculate the HOMA-IR. Let's assume we have the fasting insulin level at this time. Let's denote the fasting insulin level at the initial preoperative evaluation as \( I_1 \). The HOMA-IR at the initial preoperative evaluation would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_1 = \frac{(210 \times I_1)}{405}. \] Now, let's move to the time when the patient was on Exenatide and had HbA1c 8.3%, FG 163 mg/dL. The change in fasting glucose is given as -17 mg/dL. This means the fasting glucose decreased by 17 mg/dL from some previous value. If the previous fasting glucose was 180 mg/dL (since 163 + 17 = 180), this could be the fasting glucose before the treatment with Exenatide. The change in insulin is given as -26 uIU/mL. Let's denote the initial fasting insulin level before the treatment with Exenatide as \( I_2 \). The current fasting insulin level after the treatment would be \( I_2 - 26 \). Now we can calculate the HOMA-IR at the time when the patient had HbA1c 8.3%, FG 163 mg/dL, and the insulin level is \( I_2 - 26 \). The HOMA-IR would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR} = \frac{(163 \times (I_2 - 26))}{405}. \] Since we don't have the value of \( I_2 \), we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the HOMA-IR score based on the information given at the time of the preoperative evaluation and the changes. Let's use the information from the preoperative evaluation and the changes to estimate the HOMA-IR. At the preoperative evaluation: - Fasting Glucose (FG) = 210 mg/dL - Let's assume the fasting insulin level at this time is \( I_1 \). The HOMA-IR at the preoperative evaluation is: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_1 = \frac{(210 \times I_1)}{405}. \] After 6 months of treatment with Exenatide: - Fasting Glucose (FG) = 163 mg/dL (since it says FG decreased by 17 mg/dL from some previous value, and the previous value would be 163 + 17 = 180 mg/dL if we assume the change is from the value just before the treatment started). - The change in insulin is -26 uIU/mL. Let's denote the fasting insulin level just before the treatment started as \( I_2 \). The fasting insulin level after 6 months of treatment is \( I_2 - 26 \). The HOMA-IR after 6 months of treatment is: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_2 = \frac{(163 \times (I_2 - 26))}{405}. \] Since the problem doesn't give us the initial insulin levels, we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. But let's use the information that the patient's HbA1c improved from 10.7% to 8.3%, and the fasting glucose improved from 210 mg/dL to 163 mg/dL. Let's assume that the fasting insulin level at the preoperative evaluation is the same as the fasting insulin level just before the treatment started, i.e., \( I_1 = I_2 \). Then the HOMA-IR at the preoperative evaluation is: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_1 = \frac{(210 \times I_1)}{405}, \] and the HOMA-IR after 6 months of treatment is: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_2 = \frac{(163 \times (I_1 - 26))}{405}. \] To find the HOMA-IR score, we need the fasting insulin level. Since the problem doesn't provide the fasting insulin level, we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. Let's assume that the problem is asking for an estimated HOMA-IR based on the information given. If we use the fasting glucose level of 163 mg/dL and assume an average fasting insulin level for a patient with similar characteristics. For a patient with a BMI of 54.2 kg/m2 and HbA1c of 10.7%, the fasting insulin level might be relatively high. Let's assume an average fasting insulin level for a patient with type 2 diabetes and obesity is around 20-30 uIU/mL. Let's use the fasting insulin level of 26 uIU/mL as an example. If the fasting insulin level before the treatment was 26 uIU/mL, then the fasting insulin level after the treatment would be: \[ I_2 - 26 = 26 - 26 = 0. \] This would imply that the HOMA-IR after the treatment would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_2 = \frac{(163 \times 0)}{405} = 0. \] This seems unrealistic because it implies that the insulin level dropped to 0, which is not likely. Let's try another approach. Let's use the fasting glucose level of 163 mg/dL and assume a fasting insulin level of 20 uIU/mL. The HOMA-IR would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR} = \frac{(163 \times 20)}{405} = \frac{3260}{405} \approx 8.05. \] Let's use the fasting glucose level of 163 mg/dL and assume a fasting insulin level of 25 uIU/mL. The HOMA-IR would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR} = \frac{(163 \times 25)}{405} = \frac{4075}{405} \approx 10.06. \] Let's use the fasting glucose level of 163 mg/dL and assume a fasting insulin level of 30 uIU/mL. The HOMA-IR would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR} = \frac{(163 \times 30)}{405} = \frac{4890}{405} \approx 12.07. \] Since the problem doesn't provide the fasting insulin level, we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. However, based on the information given and assuming a fasting insulin level within the range of 20-30 uIU/mL, the HOMA-IR score would be approximately between 8.05 and 12.07. Since the problem doesn't give us the fasting insulin level, we can't provide a specific numerical answer. Thus, the answer is that we need more information to calculate the HOMA-IR score accurately. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HOMA-IR score, we need both the fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet. Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions. Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus. Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome. Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases. It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded. From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018. The patient had no medical history of past illness. The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer. The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg. In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA. On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung.

The formula for adjusted body weight is: Adjusted Body Weight = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight) The ideal body weight (IBW) for men is often calculated using the following formula: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet. The patient's height is 160 cm. Let's convert this to feet and inches. 160 cm = 160 / 2.54 inches ≈ 62.99 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the height in feet and inches is: 62.99 inches = 5 feet + (62.99 - 60) inches = 5 feet + 2.99 inches ≈ 5 feet 3 inches. Now we use the formula for ideal body weight for men: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height in inches - 60 inches) / 12 inches per foot. But since the height is 160 cm, let's use another common formula for calculating ideal body weight for men: IBW (kg) = 50 + 0.91 * (height in cm - 152.4). Let's calculate the ideal body weight using this formula: IBW = 50 + 0.91 * (160 - 152.4) IBW = 50 + 0.91 * 7.6 IBW = 50 + 6.916 IBW ≈ 56.916 kg. Now we have the actual body weight (ABW) = 56.8 kg and the ideal body weight (IBW) ≈ 56.916 kg. Using the formula for adjusted body weight: Adjusted Body Weight = IBW + 0.4 * (ABW - IBW). Plugging in the values: Adjusted Body Weight = 56.916 + 0.4 * (56.8 - 56.916) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.916 + 0.4 * (-0.116) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.916 - 0.0464 Adjusted Body Weight ≈ 56.8696 kg. Rounded to a reasonable precision, the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.87 kg. However, since the patient's actual body weight is very close to the ideal body weight, the adjusted body weight is very close to the actual body weight. So the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.8 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the adjusted body weight, we first need the patient's height and weight.

Step 1: Calculate the estimated date of ovulation. Since the cycle length is 25 days, ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of the cycle. For a cycle that starts on 02/08/2024 and has a length of 25 days, ovulation would occur approximately 25 - 14 = 11 days after the start of the LMP. So, to find the date of ovulation: Start from the LMP: 02/08/2024. Add 11 days to the LMP to get the estimated date of ovulation. Let's calculate this step by step: - 02/08/2024 + 11 days. Adding 11 days to February 8, 2024: February 8 + 11 days: February has 29 days in 2024 because it is a leap year. If we add 11 days to February 8: February 8 + 11 = February 19. So, the estimated date of ovulation is February 19, 2024. Since conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation, the estimated date of conception is around February 19, 2024. Thus, the estimated date of conception is 02/19/2024. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated date of conception, I used the information that the patient's last menstrual period (LMP) was on 02/08/2024 and her cycle length is 25 days.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

The full MDRD equation is: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times (0.742 \text{ if female}) \times (1.210 \text{ if black}) \] Given the information: - Creatinine (Cr) = 8 mg/dL - Age = 73 years - Race = African American - Gender = Female Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation. The MDRD equation for this patient is: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Where: - Cr = 8 mg/dL - Age = 73 years - The factor for being female is 0.742 - The factor for being African American is 1.210 Now let's calculate it step by step. Step 1: Calculate \( (Cr)^{-1.154} \): \[ (8)^{-1.154} \] Using a calculator: \[ (8)^{-1.154} \approx 0.097 \] Step 2: Calculate \( (Age)^{-0.203} \): \[ (73)^{-0.203} \] Using a calculator: \[ (73)^{-0.203} \approx 0.505 \] Step 3: Now plug these values into the MDRD equation: \[ GFR = 175 \times 0.097 \times 0.505 \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Let's multiply these step by step. First, multiply \( 175 \times 0.097 \): \[ 175 \times 0.097 = 16.975 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.505: \[ 16.975 \times 0.505 \approx 8.577 \] Then, multiply the result by 0.742: \[ 8.577 \times 0.742 \approx 6.361 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.210: \[ 6.361 \times 1.210 \approx 7.706 \] So the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is approximately 7.706 mL/min/1.73m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

The formula to calculate sodium concentration is: Sodium (Na+) = millimoles/L Given: Na+ = 136 </think> The sodium concentration is already provided as 136 mmol/L. Since 1 mmol/L is equivalent to 1 mEq/L for sodium (because the valence of sodium is 1), the sodium concentration is 136 mEq/L. However, the question asks for the corrected sodium concentration. To correct the sodium concentration for the patient's serum glucose and osmolality, we need to use the formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 18 From the given information, the random blood sugar is 250 mg/dL, and the measured sodium is 136 mmol/L. Let's use the formula to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. 1. The measured sodium is 136 mmol/L. 2. The glucose level is 250 mg/dL. 3. The formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 18 Now, let's plug in the values: Corrected Sodium = 136 + (250 - 100) / 18 Calculate the difference in glucose: 250 - 100 = 150 Now divide this by 18: 150 / 18 ≈ 8.33 Add this to the measured sodium: Corrected Sodium = 136 + 8.33 ≈ 144.33 So the corrected sodium concentration is approximately 144.33 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: Corrected AG = Measured AG + 2.5 * (4 - Serum Albumin [in g/dL]) Given that the serum albumin is 4.2 g/dL. Let's plug in the values: Measured AG = 32 (from the calculation above) Serum Albumin = 4.2 g/dL Corrected AG = 32 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2) Corrected AG = 32 + 2.5 * (-0.2) Corrected AG = 32 + 2.5 * (-0.2) Corrected AG = 32 + (-0.5) Corrected AG = 32 - 0.5 Corrected AG = 31.5 mEq/L However, the question seems to ask for the "albumin corrected delta gap." The delta gap is the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. The normal anion gap is typically between 8-12 mEq/L. Let's use the average normal anion gap of 10 mEq/L for simplicity. The measured anion gap is 32 mEq/L. The albumin-corrected anion gap is 31.5 mEq/L. Now, the delta gap is the difference between the corrected anion gap and the normal anion gap. Delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG Delta gap = 31.5 - 10 Delta gap = 21.5 mEq/L So the patient's albumin-corrected delta gap is 21.5 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the anion gap (AG), we use the formula: AG = [Na] - (Cl+) - (HCO3-).

Next, we need to correct this anion gap for the patient's albumin level. The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: Corrected AG = Measured AG + 2.5 * (4 - Serum Albumin [in g/dL]). The serum albumin is given as 4.2 g/dL. So, the calculation is: Corrected AG = 32 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2) = 32 + 2.5 * (-0.2) = 32 - 0.5 = 31.5 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is typically between 8-12 mEq/L; we'll use the average, which is 10 mEq/L. The delta gap is the difference between the corrected anion gap and the normal anion gap. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 31.5 - 10 = 21.5 mEq/L.", "answer": "21.5"}

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

We have the heart rate (HR) = 164 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. We need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and can be calculated from the heart rate using the formula: RR = 60 / Heart Rate. 3. Plugging in the heart rate: RR = 60 / 164 ≈ 0.366 seconds (or 0.365854 seconds if we use more precision). 4. Now we use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc): QTc = QT / √RR. 5. Plugging in the values: QTc = 330 / √0.366. 6. First, calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.366 ≈ 0.605. 7. Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc ≈ 330 / 0.605 ≈ 545.45 msec. Let's do the calculation with more precision. 1. Calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 164 ≈ 0.365854 seconds. 2. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.365854 ≈ 0.604858. 3. Now, use the Fridericia formula: QTc = 330 / 0.604858 ≈ 545.45 msec. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 545 msec.

Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 545 msec.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '461.339', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).\nThe patient's heart rate is 164 beats per minute.\nThe QT interval is 330 msec.\nThe RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/164 = 0.366.\nHence, plugging in these values, we will get 330/√(0.366) = 461.339.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 461.339 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Each of these factors is assigned a point if present. Let's break this down step-by-step for the given patient: 1. **Age ≥ 65**: The patient is 81 years old. This criterion is met. So, +1 point. 2. **Unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction**: The patient denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea and there's no mention of unstable angina or myocardial infarction. This criterion is not met. So, +0 points. 3. **Cerebrovascular disease**: The patient has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual left-sided weakness. This criterion is met. So, +1 point. 4. **Severe pulmonary disease**: There's no mention of severe pulmonary disease in the patient note. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, which suggests no severe respiratory issues. This criterion is not met. So, +0 points. 5. **Renal insufficiency**: The patient's creatinine level is 120 µmol/L. To determine if this indicates renal insufficiency, we need to convert this value to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or use a threshold for creatinine that indicates renal insufficiency. Typically, a creatinine level of 120 µmol/L corresponds roughly to an eGFR of around 60 mL/min/1.73m² or lower, depending on the patient's age, sex, and other factors. For simplicity and based on the context of the rule, if we use the creatinine level directly as an indicator, a creatinine level above a certain threshold (often around 115-130 µmol/L is considered indicative of renal impairment), we can consider this as renal insufficiency. Since the patient's creatinine is 120 µmol/L, this criterion is met. So, +1 point. Now, let's add up the points: - Age ≥ 65: +1 point - Unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction: +0 points - Cerebrovascular disease: +1 point - Severe pulmonary disease: +0 points - Renal insufficiency: +1 point Total points = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 points. According to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, the points translate to the following risk categories: - 0 points: Low risk (<1%) - 1 point: Low risk (<1%) - 2 points: Moderate risk (1-10%) - 3 points: High risk (10-20%) - 4 points or more: Very high risk (>20%) Since the patient has 3 points, the Cardiac Risk Index indicates a high risk (10-20%). So the patient's Cardiac Risk Index is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Cardiac Risk Index using the revised Cardiac Risk Index for pre-operative risk assessment, we use the following factors: Age ≥ 65, Unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction, Cerebrovascular disease, Severe pulmonary disease, and Renal insufficiency.

To convert 0.014 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine/L converts to 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The patient has pre-operative creatinine <= 2 mg/dL, so we keep the score the same at 2.\n\nThe cardiac risk index score is 2.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Step 1: Identify the criteria for the PSI score from the given patient note. The patient is a 75-year-old female, so she is over 65 years old. The given information includes: - Body temperature: 36.5°C (which is within the normal range, not < 36 or > 38°C) - Pulse rate: 82 beats per minute - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg - Hematocrit: 39% - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated) - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL (slightly high) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (within normal limits) - Arterial blood gas analysis: pH 7.40 and PaO2 80 mm Hg - Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion. To calculate the PSI score, we need to use the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scoring system, which involves several factors including age, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values. The PSI score is calculated using a complex algorithm that includes the following categories: 1. Age 2. Comorbidities 3. Vital signs 4. Laboratory values Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Age The patient is 75 years old, which puts her in the age category of ≥ 65 years. Step 2: Comorbidities The patient has a past history of congestive heart failure. According to the PSI scoring system, congestive heart failure is considered a comorbidity. Step 3: Vital Signs - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal) - Pulse rate: 82 beats per minute (normal) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (slightly elevated but not necessarily abnormal) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal) Step 4: Laboratory Values - Hematocrit: 39% (normal range for females is typically 37-47%, so this is within the normal range) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated) - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL (slightly high, but not necessarily abnormal) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (normal) - Arterial blood gas analysis: pH 7.40 (normal), PaO2 80 mm Hg (normal) Step 5: Use the PSI scoring system to calculate the score. The PSI score is determined by assigning points to various risk factors and then using a table or calculator to determine the risk class. Let's use the key components of the PSI scoring system: 1. Age: The patient is 75 years old. 2. Comorbidities: Congestive heart failure. 3. Vital signs: - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute - Pulse rate: 82 beats per minute - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg 4. Laboratory values: - WBC count: Not provided - PaO2: 80 mm Hg - BUN: 27 mg/dL - Creatinine: Not provided - Glucose: 180 mg/dL - Hematocrit: 39% Since the WBC count and creatinine levels are not provided, we will have to make some assumptions or use the information we have. Let's use the PSI calculator approach step-by-step. The PSI score is calculated based on the following factors: - Age - Comorbidities - Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure) - Laboratory values (WBC count, PaO2, BUN, creatinine, hematocrit, glucose) Since the WBC count and creatinine are not provided, we will use the information we have and make some assumptions if necessary. Let's use the PSI scoring system's risk factors and points: 1. Age ≥ 65: 1 point 2. Comorbidities: - Congestive heart failure: 1 point 3. Vital signs: - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal, no points) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (normal, no points) - Pulse rate: 82 beats per minute (normal, no points) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal, no points) 4. Laboratory values: - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal, no points) - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly high, but we need to check if it exceeds the threshold for PSI) - Hematocrit: 39% (normal, no points) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated, but we need to check if it exceeds the threshold for PSI) Now let's use the PSI scoring system's risk classes and points. The PSI score is calculated using a complex formula that involves summing up points for various risk factors and then using a table to determine the risk class. Since the WBC count and creatinine are missing, let's use the information we have and the presence of pleural effusion on chest X-ray to infer that the patient has pneumonia. Let's use the following simplified approach to estimate the PSI score: 1. Age ≥ 65: 1 point 2. Comorbidities: Congestive heart failure = 1 point 3. Vital signs: All within normal limits, so no additional points. 4. Laboratory values: - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal, no points) - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly high, but within the normal range for PSI scoring) - Hematocrit: 39% (normal, no points) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated, but we need to check if it exceeds the threshold for PSI scoring) Since the patient has a past history of congestive heart failure and is over 65 years old, she automatically falls into a higher risk category. Given the information provided, the patient has: - Age ≥ 65: 1 point - Comorbidities (Congestive heart failure): 1 point Let's assume the WBC count is within the normal range since it is not provided. Now, let's use the PSI calculator approach to determine the risk class. The PSI score is typically calculated using a table or an online calculator that takes into account all the factors. Since we don't have all the necessary lab values (WBC count, creatinine), let's use the information we have and make a reasonable assumption. Given the patient's age, comorbidities (congestive heart failure), and the presence of pleural effusion on chest X-ray, the patient likely has pneumonia. Let's assume the patient's PSI score falls into a higher risk category due to her age and comorbidities. Based on the information provided and the presence of pleural effusion, the patient likely has a PSI score that places her in a higher risk class. After considering the available information and the presence of congestive heart failure and age over 65, the patient likely falls into PSI class 3 or 4. However, without the WBC count and creatinine, we can't calculate the exact PSI score. But for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the patient's PSI score places her in PSI class 3. The PSI class 3 corresponds to a moderate risk of in-hospital mortality. So the final answer is that the patient likely has a PSI score that places her in a higher risk category. Since the exact PSI score cannot be calculated without all the necessary lab values, we can conclude that the patient has a moderate to high risk based on the information provided. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to use the given information about the patient's age, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values.

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 95.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

Let's break this down step-by-step using the information provided in the patient note. Step 1: Identify the patient's age. The patient is 69 years old. Step 2: Identify the systolic blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure is 130 mm Hg. Since it is not less than 90 mm Hg, this criterion does not apply. Step 3: Identify the heart rate. The heart rate is 88 beats per minute. Since it is not greater than 100 beats per minute, this criterion does not apply. Step 4: Identify if the patient has melena. The patient has dark, tarry stools (melena), which is present. Step 5: Identify the hemoglobin level. The hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL. Since it is not less than 70 g/L (which is approximately 7 g/dL), this criterion does not apply. Step 6: Identify the BUN level. The BUN level is 18 mg/dL. We need to convert this to mmol/L. The conversion factor is approximately 1 mg/dL = 0.357 mmol/L. Therefore, 18 mg/dL = 18 * 0.357 ≈ 6.43 mmol/L. Since the BUN level is not greater than 10 mmol/L, this criterion does not apply. Step 7: Identify if the patient has variceal bleeding. There is no mention of variceal bleeding in the note. Therefore, this criterion does not apply. Step 8: Identify if the patient has peptic ulcer disease. The patient is taking sodium bicarbonate for a diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer, so he has peptic ulcer disease. This criterion applies. Step 9: Identify if the patient is using NSAIDs or anticoagulants. There is no mention of NSAIDs or anticoagulants in the medication profile. Therefore, this criterion does not apply. Now let's assign points according to the Glasgow-Blatchford Score criteria: - Age: The patient is 69 years old. If the patient is between 50-59 years, they get 1 point; if 60-69 years, they get 2 points; if 70-79 years, they get 3 points; and if 80+ years, they get 4 points. Since the patient is 69 years old, he gets 2 points. - Systolic BP < 90 mm Hg: The systolic BP is 130 mm Hg, so this criterion is not met. 0 points. - Heart rate > 100 bpm: The heart rate is 88 bpm, so this criterion is not met. 0 points. - Sudden onset of symptoms: There is no information about the sudden onset of symptoms, so we cannot assign points for this criterion. 0 points. - Melena: The patient has melena (dark, tarry stools). This criterion applies. 1 point. - Hemoglobin < 70 g/L: The hemoglobin is 13 g/dL, which is not less than 7 g/dL (70 g/L). 0 points. - BUN > 10 mmol/L: The BUN is approximately 6.43 mmol/L, which is not greater than 10 mmol/L. 0 points. - Variceal bleed: No indication of variceal bleed. 0 points. - Peptic ulcer disease: The patient has peptic ulcer disease. 1 point. - Use of NSAIDs or anticoagulants: No mention of NSAIDs or anticoagulants. 0 points. Now, let's sum up the points: - Age (69 years): 2 points - Melena: 1 point - Peptic ulcer disease: 1 point Total score = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 points. Therefore, the patient's Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score, we use the following information from the patient note:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination. Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive. His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010. The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine. Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected. Here is the task: What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio, the formula is: Albumin corrected delta ratio = (Serum Albumin - 0.8) </think> However, it seems that I might have misunderstood the task. The term "albumin corrected delta ratio" is not a standard term in nephrology or medicine that I am familiar with. It seems like there might be some confusion or a specific context that I am missing. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the patient note. The patient's serum albumin level is given as 3.8 g/dL. Step 2: Understand the context of the term "albumin corrected delta ratio." The term "albumin corrected delta ratio" is not a standard term used in clinical practice. It seems like it might be a made-up term or a specific calculation that is not commonly used. However, if we interpret the term "albumin corrected delta ratio" as a possible calculation involving the albumin level, we might be looking at a formula similar to the one I initially thought of: (Serum Albumin - 0.8). Let's calculate this using the given albumin level. The patient's serum albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Using the formula: Albumin corrected delta ratio = (Serum Albumin - 0.8) Albumin corrected delta ratio = (3.8 - 0.8) = 3.0 But this seems to be an incorrect approach since the term "albumin corrected delta ratio" is not a standard term. It seems that the term "delta ratio" might be related to the delta creatinine or some other renal function test. Let's try another approach. The delta creatinine is the change in creatinine over time. We have the following creatinine values: - Initial creatinine: 1.15 mg/dL (from 3 years prior) - Current creatinine on admission: 10.48 mg/dL - Creatinine on day 4: 13.6 mg/dL - Creatinine at discharge: 3.54 mg/dL - Creatinine 8 weeks later: Normal (we don't have the exact value but it's back to normal). To calculate the delta creatinine, we can use the change from the baseline to the peak value. Delta creatinine = Peak creatinine - Baseline creatinine Peak creatinine = 13.6 mg/dL (the highest value mentioned during the hospital stay) Baseline creatinine = 1.15 mg/dL (from 3 years prior) Delta creatinine = 13.6 - 1.15 = 12.45 mg/dL Now, if we assume that the "albumin corrected delta ratio" involves correcting the delta creatinine by the albumin level, we might use a formula like: Albumin corrected delta ratio = Delta creatinine / Albumin Using the values we have: Delta creatinine = 12.45 mg/dL Albumin = 3.8 g/dL Albumin corrected delta ratio = 12.45 / 3.8 ≈ 3.276 However, this is still speculative since the term is not standard. Given the lack of clarity and the absence of a standard definition for "albumin corrected delta ratio," it seems that the question might be incorrectly posed or requires additional context. Since the term is not standard and the context is unclear, I will assume that the question is asking for a calculation that involves the change in creatinine and the albumin level. Let's use the formula I derived: Albumin corrected delta ratio ≈ 3.276 So the final answer is approximately 3.28. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the 'albumin corrected delta ratio,' we need to identify the relevant information from the patient note.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.

Step 3: Check for Airway compromise. The patient has symptoms such as loud snoring and noisy breathing, which indicate potential airway compromise. Therefore, this gives us 1 point. Step 4: Check for Inflammation. The patient has acute otitis media, enlarged tonsils with mild erythema and white exudates, and an elevated C-reactive protein level (17.17 mg/dL), indicating inflammation. Therefore, this gives us 1 point. Step 5: Check for Neck swelling. The patient has multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes bilaterally, and the ultrasound and CT scan confirm lymphadenopathy. Therefore, this gives us 1 point. Now, we add up all the points: Fever (≥ 38°C) = 3 points Pain = 1 point Airway compromise = 1 point Inflammation = 1 point Neck swelling = 1 point Total FeverPAIN score = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 So the patient's FeverPAIN score is 7. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we use the following components: \n1.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

Step 1: Identify the components of the CHA2DS2-VASc score. The CHA2DS2-VASc score includes the following factors: - C: Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction - H: Hypertension - A2: Age ≥ 65 years (for males, it's age ≥ 65) - D: Diabetes mellitus - S2: Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) - V: Vascular disease (e.g., peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, aortic plaque) - A: Age 65-74 years (for males) - S: Sex category (female) Now let's evaluate each component for the given patient: - **C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction):** Not mentioned in the note. So, this is 0. - **H (Hypertension):** The patient has a history of arterial hypertension. This is 1 point. - **A2 (Age ≥ 75 years):** The patient is 83 years old. Since he is over 75 years old, this is 2 points. - **D (Diabetes mellitus):** The patient has diabetes. This is 1 point. - **S2 (Stroke or TIA):** There is no mention of a previous stroke or TIA in the note. So, this is 0. - **V (Vascular disease):** The patient has diabetes, which can be considered a form of vascular disease. This is 1 point. - **A (Age 65-74 years):** Since the patient is 83 years old, this category does not apply because he is older than 74 years. So, this is 0. - **S (Sex category):** The patient is male. The sex category for males is 0. Now let's add up the points: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A2 (Age ≥ 75 years): 2 points - D (Diabetes mellitus): 1 point - V (Vascular disease): 1 point Adding these up: 1 (H) + 2 (A2) + 1 (D) + 1 (V) = 5 points. So the CHA2DS2-VASc score for this patient is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the patient, we need to evaluate each component of the score based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n- C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction): Not mentioned.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L.

Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody.

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the formula is: FIB-4 index = π^3 / Platelet count Where π is approximately 3.14 Given values: Platelet count = 101000/μL FIB-4 = (3.14^3) / 101000 ≈ 1.97 </think> However, the correct formula for the FIB-4 index is: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(\text{Age} \times \text{AST})}{(\text{Platelet Count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}})} \] To calculate the FIB-4 index, we need the following information: - Age of the patient - AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) - ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) - Platelet count From the patient note, we have the following information: - The patient is a two-year-old. - The most recent AST and ALT values before the liver biopsy are not explicitly given in the text for the calculation of the FIB-4 index. However, the values just before the liver biopsy are mentioned as AST 547 IU/L and ALT 600 IU/L. - The platelet count before the liver biopsy was 101000 / μL. Let's use these values to calculate the FIB-4 index. The formula for the FIB-4 index is: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{\text{Age} \times \text{AST}}{\text{Platelet Count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}}} \] Plugging in the values: - Age = 2 years - AST = 547 IU/L - ALT = 600 IU/L - Platelet Count = 101000 / μL Now, let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{600} \approx 24.49 \] 2. Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{2 \times 547}{101000 \times 24.49} \] 3. Calculate the numerator: \[ 2 \times 547 = 1094 \] 4. Calculate the denominator: \[ 101000 \times 24.49 \approx 2473490 \] 5. Now, divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{1094}{2473490} \approx 0.000442 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000442. Thus, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the required parameters for the FIB-4 index: Age, AST, ALT, and Platelet Count. 2. Use the values from the patient note: Age = 2 years, AST = 547 IU/L, ALT = 600 IU/L, and Platelet Count = 101000 / μL. 3. Calculate the square root of ALT: $\sqrt{600} \approx 24.49$. 4. Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula: $\text{FIB-4} = \frac{2 \times 547}{101000 \times 24.49}$. 5. Compute the numerator: $2 \times 547 = 1094$. 6. Compute the denominator: $101000 \times 24.49 \approx 2473490$. 7. Divide the numerator by the denominator: $\frac{1094}{2473490} \approx 0.000442$. Therefore, the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000442. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, we use the formula: FIB-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet Count * sqrt(ALT)). From the patient note, we have the following values: Age = 2 years, AST = 547 IU/L, ALT = 600 IU/L, and Platelet Count = 101000 / μL. First, we calculate the square root of ALT: sqrt(600) ≈ 24.49. Next, we plug the values into the formula: FIB-4 = (2 * 547) / (101000 * 24.49). We calculate the numerator: 2 * 547 = 1094. Then we calculate the denominator: 101000 * 24.49 ≈ 2473490.

Therefore, the mean arterial pressure is 126 mmHg.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '126', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 100.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 178.0 mm Hg = 126.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 126.0 mm Hg.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range. The plan is to continue monitoring her closely and to adjust her therapies as needed based on the comprehensive assessment of her case.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score includes the following components: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg) - A: Abnormal renal/liver function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR - E: Elderly (age > 65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly Let's evaluate each component based on the given patient note: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg or on treatment for hypertension):** - The patient has a documented history of hypertension. - This criterion is met. - Score = 1 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function:** - The patient has hepatic cirrhosis (suggestive signs) and confirmed renal disease (due to her kidney transplant). - This criterion is met. - Score = 1 3. **S: Stroke:** - The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) of the brain last year. - TIA is considered a risk factor similar to stroke. - This criterion is met. - Score = 1 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition:** - The patient denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. - There is no clear history of a major bleeding episode. - No known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. - However, the patient drinks more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. - Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of bleeding. - This criterion is met due to excessive alcohol consumption. - Score = 1 5. **L: Labile INR (INR outside the therapeutic range in the past 6 months):** - The blood investigations show a stable international normalized ratio (INR). - This criterion is not met. - Score = 0 6. **E: Elderly (age > 65 years):** - The patient is 22 years old. - This criterion is not met. - Score = 0 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, or alcohol):** - The patient drinks more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. - This criterion is met due to excessive alcohol consumption. - Score = 1 Now, let's sum up the scores for each criterion: - H: 1 - A: 1 - S: 1 - B: 1 - L: 0 - E: 0 - D: 1 Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 1 (S) + 1 (B) + 0 (L) + 0 (E) + 1 (D) = 5 Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for the patient, we will evaluate each component of the HAS-BLED score based on the provided information.\n\n- **H: Hypertension**: The patient has a documented history of hypertension.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Here is the task:

Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

The full MDRD equation is: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times (0.742 \text{ if female}) \times (1.210 \text{ if black}) \] Let's use the given information to calculate the GFR step-by-step. Given: - Serum Creatinine (Cr) = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - The patient is female. - The patient is African-American. The MDRD equation for this patient would be: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Let's plug in the values: 1. Serum Creatinine (Cr) = 14.6 mg/dL 2. Age = 27 years 3. The patient is female, so we multiply by 0.742. 4. The patient is African-American, so we multiply by 1.210. Now, let's calculate it step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate \( (Cr)^{-1.154} \). \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \] Using a calculator: \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \approx 0.037 \] Step 2: Calculate \( (Age)^{-0.203} \). \[ (27)^{-0.203} \] Using a calculator: \[ (27)^{-0.203} \approx 0.58 \] Step 3: Now plug these values into the MDRD equation. \[ GFR = 175 \times 0.037 \times 0.58 \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Let's multiply these step-by-step. Step 4: First, multiply \( 175 \times 0.037 \). \[ 175 \times 0.037 = 6.475 \] Step 5: Next, multiply the result by 0.58. \[ 6.475 \times 0.58 = 3.7595 \] Step 6: Then, multiply the result by 0.742. \[ 3.7595 \times 0.742 = 2.786 \] Step 7: Finally, multiply the result by 1.210. \[ 2.786 \times 1.210 = 3.371 \] So, the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is approximately 3.371 mL/min/1.73 m². Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 3 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the patient's GFR is approximately 3 mL/min/1.73 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the MDRD equation, we use the formula: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times (0.742 \text{ if female}) \times (1.210 \text{ if black}) \\ Given: \n - Serum Creatinine (Cr) = 14.6 mg/dL \n - Age = 27 years \n - The patient is female. \n - The patient is African-American. \n Step 1: Calculate \( (Cr)^{-1.154} \). \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \approx 0.037 \] Step 2: Calculate \( (Age)^{-0.203} \). \[ (27)^{-0.203} \approx 0.58 \] Step 3: Plug these values into the MDRD equation: \[ GFR = 175 \times 0.037 \times 0.58 \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Step 4: Multiply step-by-step: \[ 175 \times 0.037 = 6.475 \] \[ 6.475 \times 0.58 = 3.7595 \] \[ 3.7595 \times 0.742 = 2.786 \] \[ 2.786 \times 1.210 = 3.371 \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 3.371 mL/min/1.73 m², which rounds to about 3 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "3"} {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the MDRD equation, we use the formula: \[ GFR = 175 \times (Cr)^{-1.154} \times (Age)^{-0.203} \times (0.742 \text{ if female}) \times (1.210 \text{ if black}) \\ Given: \n - Serum Creatinine (Cr) = 14.6 mg/dL \n - Age = 27 years \n - The patient is female. \n - The patient is African-American. \n Step 1: Calculate \( (Cr)^{-1.154} \). \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \approx 0.037 \] Step 2: Calculate \( (Age)^{-0.203} \). \[ (27)^{-0.203} \approx 0.58 \] Step 3: Plug these values into the MDRD equation: \[ GFR = 175 \times 0.037 \times 0.58 \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Step 4: Multiply step-by-step: \[ 175 \times 0.037 = 6.475 \] \[ 6.475 \times 0.58 = 3.7595 \] \[ 3.7595 \times 0.742 = 2.786 \] \[ 2.786 \times 1.210 = 3.371 \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 3.371 mL/min/1.73 m², which rounds to about 3 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "3"}

The patient's height is 145 cm. Convert this to meters: 145 cm = 1.45 m. 2. The target BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2. 3. Use the formula for BMI: BMI = weight / (height)^2. 4. Rearrange the formula to solve for weight: weight = BMI * (height)^2. 5. Substitute the given values into the formula: weight = 18.5 * (1.45)^2. 6. Calculate (1.45)^2: (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. 7. Now multiply this result by the target BMI: weight = 18.5 * 2.1025 ≈ 38.89625 kg. Rounded to two decimal places, the target weight is approximately 38.90 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

We have the heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. We need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and can be calculated from the heart rate using the formula: RR = 60 / Heart Rate. 3. Plugging in the heart rate: RR = 60 / 154 ≈ 0.3903 seconds. 4. Now we use the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval, which is given by: QTc = QT / √RR. 5. Plugging in the values: QTc = 330 / √0.3903. 6. First, calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.3903 ≈ 0.6247. 7. Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc ≈ 330 / 0.6247 ≈ 528.3 msec. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 528 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 528 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges Formula: QTc (msec) = QT / √RR interval. First, we calculate the RR interval using the formula RR = 60 / Heart Rate. Given the heart rate is 154 bpm, RR = 60 / 154 ≈ 0.3903 seconds.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

Step 1: Identify the components of the CURB-65 score. The CURB-65 score includes the following criteria: - C (Confusion): The presence of mental confusion. - U (Urea): Serum urea level. - R (Respiratory rate): Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute. - B (Blood pressure): Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mmHg. - Age ≥ 65 years. Now let's evaluate each criterion for the given patient: 1. **Confusion (C):** The patient appears in mild distress but there is no mention of confusion or altered mental status in the patient note. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Urea (U):** The lab results show the urea nitrogen level is 14 mg/dL. A high urea level is defined as a serum urea level ≥ 7 mmol/L (which is approximately ≥ 20 mg/dL). Since the patient's urea nitrogen level is 14 mg/dL, this criterion is not met. 3. **Respiratory rate (R):** The patient's respiratory rate is 16/min. The criterion for this component is a respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute. Since the respiratory rate is 16/min, this criterion is not met. 4. **Blood pressure (B):** The patient's blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg. The criterion for this component is a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mmHg. Since the systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is 85 mmHg, this criterion is not met. 5. **Age ≥ 65 years:** The patient is 62 years old. Therefore, this criterion is not met since the patient is not 65 years or older. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea: No - Respiratory rate ≥ 30: No - Blood pressure criteria (systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg): No - Age ≥ 65: No None of the criteria are met. Therefore, the CURB-65 score is 0. So the CURB-65 score for this patient is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to evaluate the following components for the patient: C (Confusion), U (Urea), R (Respiratory rate ≥ 30), B (Blood pressure: systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg), and Age ≥ 65.\n\n1. Confusion (C): The patient appears in mild distress but there is no mention of confusion. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n2. Urea (U): The serum urea nitrogen level is 14 mg/dL. Since the threshold for high urea is typically ≥ 7 mmol/L (approximately ≥ 20 mg/dL), this criterion is not met.\n3. Respiratory rate (R): The respiratory rate is 16/min. The criterion is a respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute. Since the respiratory rate is 16/min, this criterion is not met.\n4. Blood pressure (B): The blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg. The criterion is systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg. Since the systolic is 150 mmHg and the diastolic is 85 mmHg, this criterion is not met.\n5. Age ≥ 65: The patient is 62 years old, so this criterion is not met.\n\nSince none of the criteria are met, the CURB-65 score is 0.", "answer": "0"}

The Centor Score actually includes the following criteria: 1. Fever (measured or reported) 2. Absence of cough 3. Tonsillar exudate (pus on the tonsils) 4. Swollen and tender anterior cervical lymph nodes 5. Age (less than 15 years old is a point, while being 15 or older subtracts a point) Let's evaluate the patient's information against these criteria: 1. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 100.8°F (38.2°C), which indicates fever. This criterion is met. +1 point. 2. **Absence of cough**: The patient endorses fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days but does not mention having a cough. Since the patient does not report a cough, this criterion is met. +1 point. 3. **Tonsillar exudate**: The physical exam notes that the patient has an erythematous oropharynx with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. However, there is no specific mention of tonsillar exudate (pus on the tonsils). Therefore, we cannot confirm this criterion is met. 0 points. 4. **Swollen and tender anterior cervical lymph nodes**: The physical exam mentions "posterior cervical lymphadenopathy," which indicates swollen lymph nodes in the posterior cervical area. This criterion is met. +1 point. 5. **Age**: The patient is 19 years old. Since the patient is over 15 years old, this criterion subtracts a point. -1 point.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.

Since the patient's weight is not provided, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluid.

Let's assume the question is not directly related to the given patient note and is a standalone question about calculating maintenance fluids for a 22-year-old male. If we assume a standard weight for a healthy 22-year-old male, let's use an average weight of 70 kg for the calculation. Now, let's calculate the maintenance fluid for a 70 kg patient. Step 1: Calculate the maintenance fluid for the first 10 kg. - 4 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 40 mL/hr Step 2: Calculate the maintenance fluid for the next 10 kg. - 2 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 20 mL/hr Step 3: Calculate the maintenance fluid for the remaining weight (70 kg - 20 kg = 50 kg). - 1 mL/kg/hr * 50 kg = 50 mL/hr Step 4: Add all these amounts together to get the total maintenance fluid. - 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 50 mL/hr = 110 mL/hr So, the maintenance fluid for a 70 kg patient is 110 mL/hr.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

Eye Opening: - Spontaneous: 4 - To verbal command: 3 - To pain: 2 - None: 1 Given the patient's information: - The patient's eyes "slightly opened", which suggests a score of 3. 2. Verbal Response: - The patient is described as "nonverbal", which corresponds to a score of 1. 3. Motor Response: - The patient's limbs hesitated to reflex into extension movement, which corresponds to a score of 3. Glasgow Coma Score = Eye Opening + Verbal Response + Motor Response GCS = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 </think> So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. **Eye Opening:** The patient's eyes "slightly opened" in response to a sternal rub. This indicates that the eye-opening response is not spontaneous but is in response to pain. Therefore, the score for Eye Opening is 2 (To pain). 2. **Verbal Response:** The patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. This corresponds to a score of 1 (None). 3. **Motor Response:** The patient's limbs reflexed into an extension movement hesitantly. An extension movement in response to pain is associated with a score of 2 (Abnormal flexion or extension). However, the description of "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement" suggests a motor response to pain, which corresponds to a score of 3 (Abnormal flexion). Let's break it down systematically: - **Eye Opening:** - Spontaneous: 4 - To verbal command: 3 - To pain: 2 - None: 1 The patient's eyes "slightly opened" in response to a sternal rub. This indicates that the eye-opening response is to pain. Therefore, the score for Eye Opening is 2. - **Verbal Response:** - Oriented: 5 - Confused: 4 - Inappropriate words: 3 - Incomprehensible sounds: 2 - None: 1 The patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. Therefore, the score for Verbal Response is 1 (None). - **Motor Response:** - Obeys commands: 6 - Localizes pain: 5 - Withdraws from pain: 4 - Flexion to pain (decorticate posturing): 3 - Extension to pain (decerebrate posturing): 2 - None: 1 The patient's limbs hesitated to reflex into an extension movement. This suggests a motor response to pain, and the extension movement corresponds to a score of 2 (Extension to pain). So the scores are: - Eye Opening: 2 (To pain) - Verbal Response: 1 (None) - Motor Response: 2 (Extension to pain) Thus, the GCS = 2 (Eye Opening) + 1 (Verbal Response) + 2 (Motor Response) = 5. But let's consider another interpretation based on the hesitating movement. If the movement is considered a hesitant response to pain and it involves some form of movement, it might be interpreted as a flexion response (which is a score of 3 for abnormal flexion). So, if we take the Motor Response as 3 (Abnormal flexion), the scores would be: - Eye Opening: 2 (To pain) - Verbal Response: 1 (None) - Motor Response: 3 (Abnormal flexion) Thus, the GCS = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Given the information that the patient's limbs "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement," it seems more likely that the movement is an extension movement, which corresponds to a score of 2 for the motor response. Therefore, the most appropriate score is: GCS = 2 (Eye Opening) + 1 (Verbal Response) + 2 (Motor Response) = 5. So the final score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate three components: Eye Opening, Verbal Response, and Motor Response.\n\n1. **Eye Opening:** - The patient's eyes \"slightly opened\" in response to a sternal rub. This indicates that the eye-opening response is to pain. Therefore, the score for Eye Opening is 2 (To pain).\n 2. **Verbal Response:** - The patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. Therefore, the score for Verbal Response is 1 (None).\n 3. **Motor Response:** - The patient's limbs hesitated to reflex into an extension movement. An extension movement in response to pain corresponds to a score of 2 (Extension to pain).\n Now, let's add up the scores: - Eye Opening: 2 - Verbal Response: 1 - Motor Response: 2 Thus, the GCS = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n Therefore, the Glasgow Coma Score is 5.", "answer": "5"}

Step 1: Identify the patient's age. The patient is 63 years old. According to the Caprini Score, if the patient is ≥ 40 years old, this contributes 1 point. Step 2: Identify if the patient has had surgery or trauma. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and sustained multiple traumas, including multiple rib fractures, a left femoral shaft fracture, and a traumatic brain injury. This indicates that the patient has experienced significant trauma. In the Caprini Score, major trauma (such as fractures, head injury, spinal cord injury) is considered and contributes points. For major trauma, the Caprini Score assigns points as follows: - Major trauma: 5 points Step 3: Identify any additional risk factors related to mobility impairment. The patient remains confined to bed due to her injuries. Being bedridden or having limited mobility is a significant risk factor for VTE. The Caprini Score assigns points for mobility impairment as follows: - Bedridden for > 3 days or unable to walk: 1 point Step 4: Identify other risk factors such as malignancy, obesity, history of VTE, and other conditions. - The patient has a history of prior DVT. A history of VTE (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) contributes 1 point. - The patient has a BMI of 27.1 kg/m^2. This is considered overweight but not obese (obesity is typically defined as a BMI ≥ 30). Therefore, this does not contribute any points according to the Caprini Score. - The patient has elevated serum homocysteine, which is a risk factor for thrombosis but is not specifically included in the Caprini Score. - The patient has varicose veins bilaterally. Varicose veins contribute 1 point in the Caprini Score. - The patient's mother had a DVT/PE in her 50's. This indicates a family history of VTE, which contributes 1 point. Now let's sum up the points based on the Caprini Score criteria: 1. Age ≥ 40 years: 1 point 2. Major trauma: 5 points 3. Bedridden or unable to walk: 1 point 4. History of VTE (prior DVT): 1 point 5. Varicose veins: 1 point 6. Family history of VTE: 1 point Adding these points together: 1 (Age) + 5 (Major trauma) + 1 (Bedridden) + 1 (History of VTE) + 1 (Varicose veins) + 1 (Family history of VTE) = 10 points Therefore, the patient's Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism is 10. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), we need to evaluate several factors from the patient's profile.

We have the heart rate (HR) = 79 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. We need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and can be calculated from the heart rate using the formula: RR = 60 / HR. 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.\nOver the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.\nOn examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.\nPhysical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.\nContrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.\nHer laboratory studies were as shown in .\nSerum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

Generally, a low-grade fever is considered to be between 37.5°C to 38.3°C. Since the patient has a low-grade fever, it suggests that the fever is likely within the range of 37.5°C to 38.3°C. This range corresponds to either a mild or moderate fever according to the FeverPAIN scale. Given that a low-grade fever is usually considered to be within the range of 37.5°C to 38.3°C, it would fall into the "moderate fever" category if it's above 37.8°C and up to 38.3°C, or the "mild fever" category if it's between 37.5°C and 37.8°C. Since the term "low-grade fever" is somewhat ambiguous between mild and moderate, and without the exact temperature, I'll assume it's within the moderate fever range (between 37.9°C and 38.3°C), which is typically associated with a low-grade fever. According to the FeverPAIN scale: - Mild fever (less than 37.8°C) = 1 point - Moderate fever (between 37.9°C and 38.3°C) = 2 points - Severe fever (above 38.4°C) = 3 points Since the patient has a low-grade fever, and assuming it falls within the moderate fever range (between 37.9°C and 38.3°C), the FeverPAIN score for the fever component would be 2 points.

Now, let's count the days month by month from July 18, 2010, to February 9, 2011. - From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: July has 31 days. So, from July 18 to July 31 is $31 - 18 = 13$ days. - August 2010 has 31 days. - September 2010 has 30 days. - October 2010 has 31 days. - November 2010 has 30 days. - December 2010 has 31 days. - January 2011 has 31 days. - And from February 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011, is 9 days. Now, let's add up all these days: - Days from July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: 13 days. - August 2010: 31 days. - September 2010: 30 days. - October 2010: 31 days. - November 2010: 30 days. - December 2010: 31 days. - January 2011: 31 days. - February 1 to February 9, 2011: 9 days. Adding these together: \[ 13 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 9 \] Let's do the addition step by step: \[ 13 + 31 = 44 \] \[ 44 + 30 = 74 \] \[ 74 + 31 = 105 \] \[ 105 + 30 = 135 \] \[ 135 + 31 = 166 \] \[ 166 + 31 = 197 \] \[ 197 + 9 = 206 \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 206 days. To convert 206 days into weeks and days, we divide 206 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). \[ 206 \div 7 = 29.42857 \] This means there are 29 full weeks. To find the number of remaining days, we calculate: \[ 206 - (29 \times 7) = 206 - 203 = 3 \] So, 206 days is equal to 29 weeks and 3 days.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The question seems to ask for the "delta gap," but typically, the term "delta gap" is not standard in this context. The term "anion gap" is what we just calculated. If the question is asking for the anion gap, the answer is 30 mEq/L. Therefore, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the formula for the anion gap: Anion Gap = [Na+] - (Cl- + HCO3-). 2. Plug in the given values: [Na+] = 137 mmol/L, [Cl-] = 98 mmol/L, and [HCO3-] = 9 mmol/L. 3. Calculate the sum of Cl- and HCO3-: 98 + 9 = 107. 4. Subtract this sum from the sodium level: 137 - 107 = 30. Thus, the anion gap is 30 mEq/L. The answer to the question is 30. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the anion gap, we use the formula: Anion Gap = [Na+] - (Cl- + HCO3-).

He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.", 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '30', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' To calculate the delta gap in mEq/L, the formula is: Delta Gap = Anion Gap = [Na+] - (Cl- + HCO3-) Given values: - Sodium (Na+) = 137 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl-) = 98 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3-) = 9 mmol/L ', 'LLM Explanation': 'To calculate the Delta Gap, using the formula: Delta Gap = Na - (Cl+ HCO3) = 137 - (98 + 9) = 137 - 107 = 30', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '30', 'Target Explanation': 'To calculate the anion gap, we use the formula: Anion Gap = [Na+] - (Cl- + HCO3-). Given the values: Sodium (Na+) = 137 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl-) = 98 mmol/L, and Bicarbonate (HCO3-) = 9 mmol/L. Plugging these into the formula gives us: Anion Gap = 137 - (98 + 9). First, calculate the sum inside the parenthesis: 98 + 9 = 107. Then, subtract this sum from the sodium level: 137 - 107 = 30. Therefore, the anion gap is 30 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '18', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Step 1: Calculate the Respiratory component of the SOFA score. The Respiratory component is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio or the use of mechanical ventilation. The patient's PaO₂ is 77 mm Hg and FiO₂ is 54%. The PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is calculated as: \[ \text{PaO₂/FiO₂} = \frac{77}{0.54} \approx 142.59 \] Using the SOFA Respiratory criteria: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: Score = 0 - 400 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300: Score = 1 - 300 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 200: Score = 2 - 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100: Score = 3 - PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100: Score = 4 Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 142.59, it falls into the range 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100. Therefore, the Respiratory score is 3. Step 2: Calculate the Cardiovascular component of the SOFA score. The Cardiovascular component is based on the use of vasopressors and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient is on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min respectively, and norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. According to the SOFA Cardiovascular criteria: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg: Score = 0 - No vasopressors and MAP < 70 mm Hg, or any dose of Dopamine: Score = 1 - Dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min or any dose of Dobutamine or Noradrenaline/Epinephrine ≤ 0.1 mcg/kg/min: Score = 2 - Noradrenaline/Epinephrine > 0.1 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min: Score = 3 - Noradrenaline/Epinephrine > 0.5 mcg/kg/min: Score = 4 Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, we need to focus on the highest dose of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine because they are the most potent vasopressors. The doses are: - norEPINEPHrine: 0.07 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine: 0.03 mcg/kg/min The total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine is the sum of the doses of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine: \[ 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min \] Since the total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine is 0.1 mcg/kg/min, it falls into the range "Noradrenaline/Epinephrine > 0.1 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min," which corresponds to a score of 3. Step 3: Calculate the Hepatic component of the SOFA score. The Hepatic component is based on the bilirubin level. The patient's bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL. Using the SOFA Hepatic criteria: - Bilirubin < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2 ≤ Bilirubin < 1.7: Score = 1 - 1.7 ≤ Bilirubin < 2.2: Score = 2 - 2.2 ≤ Bilirubin < 6.0: Score = 3 - Bilirubin ≥ 6.0: Score = 4 Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.7 ≤ Bilirubin < 2.2, which corresponds to a score of 2. Step 4: Calculate the Neurological component of the SOFA score. The Neurological component is based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). The patient's GCS is 13. Using the SOFA Neurological criteria: - GCS 15: Score = 0 - 14 ≤ GCS ≤ 13: Score = 1 - 12 ≤ GCS ≤ 9: Score = 2 - 8 ≤ GCS ≤ 5: Score = 3 - GCS ≤ 4: Score = 4 Since the GCS is 13, it falls into the range 14 ≤ GCS ≤ 13, which corresponds to a score of 1. Step 5: Calculate the Renal component of the SOFA score. The Renal component is based on the serum creatinine level or urine output. The patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and the urine output is 925 mL/day. Using the SOFA Renal criteria: For creatinine: - Creatinine < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2 ≤ Creatinine < 1.4: Score = 1 - 1.4 ≤ Creatinine < 1.7: Score = 2 - 1.7 ≤ Creatinine < 2.3: Score = 3 - Creatinine ≥ 2.3: Score = 4 Since the creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.7 ≤ Creatinine < 2.3, which corresponds to a score of 3. For urine output, the criteria are: - Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour: Score = 0 - Urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour: Score = 4 To calculate the urine output criterion, we need the patient's weight. Since the weight is not provided, we will use the creatinine level to determine the Renal score. Thus, the Renal score based on creatinine is 3. Now, let's sum up all the scores from each component: - Respiratory: 3 - Cardiovascular: 3 - Hepatic: 2 - Neurological: 1 - Renal: 3 The total SOFA score is the sum of these individual scores: \[ 3 (Respiratory) + 3 (Cardiovascular) + 2 (Hepatic) + 1 (Neurological) + 3 (Renal) = 12 \] Therefore, the patient's SOFA score is 12. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate each of the six components: Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Hepatic, Coagulation, Renal, and Neurological.

The total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine is 0.1 mcg/kg/min. According to the SOFA Cardiovascular criteria, a total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine between 0.1 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min corresponds to a score of 3.\n\nStep 3: Hepatic Component\nThe patient's bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL. According to the SOFA Hepatic criteria, a bilirubin level in the range 1.7 ≤ Bilirubin < 2.2 corresponds to a score of 2.\n\nStep 4: Neurological Component\nThe patient's GCS is 13. According to the SOFA Neurological criteria, a GCS in the range 14 ≤ GCS ≤ 13 corresponds to a score of 1.\n\nStep 5: Renal Component\nThe patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the SOFA Renal criteria, a creatinine level in the range 1.7 ≤ Creatinine < 2.3 corresponds to a score of 3. The urine output is 925 mL/day, but without the patient's weight, we use the creatinine level to determine the Renal score, which is 3.\n\nNow, we sum up the scores from each component:\n- Respiratory: 3\n- Cardiovascular: 3\n- Hepatic: 2\n- Neurological: 1\n- Renal: 3\n\nTotal SOFA score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 12.", "answer": "12"}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

This criterion is likely met. 4. **Tonsillar exudate**: The presence of lymphoid follicles suggests inflammation and possibly exudate, but the note does not explicitly mention tonsillar exudate. However, the presence of lymphoid follicles could imply tonsillar inflammation. 5. **Age**: The patient is 16 years old. The Centor Score has an age criterion where patients aged 15-44 years get a point if they do not have a cough. The Centor Score criteria are: - Fever (temperature > 38°C) - Absence of cough - Cervical lymphadenopathy (enlarged, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes) - Tonsillar exudate Let's apply these to the given information: - **Fever**: Yes, the patient has a fever (39°C). This is a positive point. +1 point. - **Absence of cough**: The patient has a cough. This is a negative point. 0 points. - **Cervical lymphadenopathy**: The note mentions lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall with a maximum diameter of 9 mm. This suggests enlarged tonsils or lymph nodes. +1 point. - **Tonsillar exudate**: The presence of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall suggests tonsillar inflammation, but there is no explicit mention of tonsillar exudate. However, the presence of lymphoid follicles can be indicative of tonsillar inflammation. We will assume this is a positive point based on the context. +1 point. Now let's count the points: - Fever: +1 - Absence of cough: 0 (since the patient has a cough) - Cervical lymphadenopathy: +1 - Tonsillar exudate: +1 Total Centor Score = 1 (fever) + 0 (absence of cough) + 1 (cervical lymphadenopathy) + 1 (tonsillar exudate) = 3 points. So the Centor Score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we use the following criteria: Fever, Absence of cough, Cervical lymphadenopathy, and Tonsillar exudate.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

Let's correct this step-by-step. The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3) But the Delta Gap is defined as the difference between the measured bicarbonate (HCO3) and the calculated bicarbonate (which is derived from the anion gap). The formula for the calculated bicarbonate is: Calculated Bicarbonate = 24 - (Anion Gap - 12) And the Delta Gap is: Delta Gap = Measured HCO3 - Calculated Bicarbonate Let's calculate the Anion Gap first: Anion Gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3) Given: - Na = 135 mmol/L - Cl = 103 mmol/L - HCO3 = 19 mmol/L Anion Gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 mmol/L Now, we use the formula for the calculated bicarbonate: Calculated Bicarbonate = 24 - (Anion Gap - 12) Plugging in the Anion Gap value: Calculated Bicarbonate = 24 - (13 - 12) = 24 - 1 = 23 mmol/L Now we can calculate the Delta Gap: Delta Gap = Measured HCO3 - Calculated Bicarbonate Plugging in the values: Delta Gap = 19 - 23 = -4 mEq/L So the patient's Delta Gap is -4 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Delta Gap, we need to follow these steps:\n1.

{'Row Number': 741, 'Calculator Name': 'Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '63', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-2791737-1', 'Patient Note': 'Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L).

Let's break this down step-by-step using the given information. Step 1: Identify the parameters and their corresponding scores from the APACHE II scoring system. 1. Age: The patient is 73 years old. - Age Score: For age 71-80, the score is 4. 2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): The patient's GCS is 15. - GCS Score: For GCS 15, the score is 1. 3. Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. - Temperature Score: For 36.0-38.0°C, the score is 0. 4. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): We need to calculate the MAP from the given systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The formula for MAP is: MAP = (2 x Diastolic + Systolic) / 3. - Given: Systolic BP = 138 mmHg, Diastolic BP = 92 mmHg. - MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = (184 + 138) / 3 = 322 / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. - MAP Score: For MAP 70-110 mmHg, the score is 0. 5. Respiratory Rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. - Respiratory Rate Score: For respiratory rate > 34 breaths per minute, the score is 4. 6. PaO2/FiO2 Ratio: We need to calculate the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. - Given: PaO2 = 78 mmHg, FiO2 = 0.63 (since the fraction of inspired air is 63%). - PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. - PaO2/FiO2 Score: For PaO2/FiO2 101-150, the score is 3. 7. pH: The patient's pH is 7.29. - pH Score: For pH 7.21-7.30, the score is 2. 8. Serum Sodium: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. - Serum Sodium Score: For sodium 130-145 mmol/L, the score is 0. 9. Serum Potassium: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. - Serum Potassium Score: For potassium 3.1-5.0 mmol/L, the score is 0. 10. White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The patient's WBC is 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL). - WBC Score: For WBC > 20 x 10^9/L or < 4 x 10^9/L, the score is 2. Since 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL = 15.1 x 10^9/L, this falls into the category of > 20 x 10^9/L if we assume a typo and it should be 15,100 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^9/L). However, since 15.1 x 10^9/L is between 10 and 20 x 10^9/L, the correct score for WBC between 10-20 x 10^9/L is 1. But if we take the given value as 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL), it is within the normal range (4-10 x 10^9/L), so the score would be 0. Let's assume the given value is correct and within the normal range. - WBC Score: For WBC 4-10 x 10^9/L, the score is 0. 11. Serum Creatinine: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. - Convert creatinine to µmol/L: 1 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L. - 4.58 mg/dL = 4.58 * 88.4 ≈ 405.67 µmol/L. - Serum Creatinine Score: For creatinine > 5.0 mg/dL (which is > 442 µmol/L), the score is 3. Since 4.58 mg/dL is just below 5.0 mg/dL, we use the closest range. - For creatinine 3.0-5.0 mg/dL (which is 265.2 - 442 µmol/L), the score is 2. - Since 4.58 mg/dL is within the range of 3.0-5.0 mg/dL, the score is 2. 12. Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is 41%. - Hematocrit Score: For hematocrit 30-44%, the score is 0. Now, let's sum up all the scores: - Age: 4 - GCS: 1 - Temperature: 0 - MAP: 0 - Respiratory Rate: 4 - PaO2/FiO2: 3 - pH: 2 - Serum Sodium: 0 - Serum Potassium: 0 - WBC: 0 - Serum Creatinine: 2 - Hematocrit: 0 Adding these scores together: APACHE II Score = 4 (Age) + 1 (GCS) + 0 (Temperature) + 0 (MAP) + 4 (Respiratory Rate) + 3 (PaO2/FiO2) + 2 (pH) + 0 (Serum Sodium) + 0 (Serum Potassium) + 0 (WBC) + 2 (Serum Creatinine) + 0 (Hematocrit) APACHE II Score = 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 16.

Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. Age: The patient is 73 years old. For age 71-80, the score is 4.\\n2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): The patient's GCS is 15. For GCS 15, the score is 1.\\n3. Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. For 36.0-38.0°C, the score is 0.\\n4. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): We calculate MAP from the given systolic (138 mmHg) and diastolic (92 mmHg) blood pressures. MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. For MAP 70-110 mmHg, the score is 0.\\n5. Respiratory Rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. For respiratory rate > 34 breaths per minute, the score is 4.\\n6. PaO2/FiO2 Ratio: Given PaO2 = 78 mmHg and FiO2 = 0.63, PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. For PaO2/FiO2 101-150, the score is 3.\\n7. pH: The patient's pH is 7.29. For pH 7.21-7.30, the score is 2.\\n8. Serum Sodium: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. For sodium 130-145 mmol/L, the score is 0.\\n9. Serum Potassium: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. For potassium 3.1-5.0 mmol/L, the score is 0.\\n10. White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The patient's WBC is 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL). Assuming this is a typo and should be within the normal range or within the given range, for WBC 4-10 x 10^9/L, the score is 0.\\n11. Serum Creatinine: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. Converting to µmol/L gives approximately 405.67 µmol/L. For creatinine 3.0-5.0 mg/dL (which is 265.2 - 442 µmol/L), the score is 2.\\n12. Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is 41%. For hematocrit 30-44%, the score is 0.\\n\\nNow, sum up all the scores:\\n- Age: 4\\n- GCS: 1\\n- Temperature: 0\\n- MAP: 0\\n- Respiratory Rate: 4\\n- PaO2/FiO2: 3\\n- pH: 2\\n- Serum Sodium: 0\\n- Serum Potassium: 0\\n- WBC: 0\\n- Serum Creatinine: 2\\n- Hematocrit: 0\\n\\nAdding these scores together: 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 16.\\n\\nTherefore, the APACHE II score is 16.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '41', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 73.0 years old. The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative . Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 92.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 138.0 mm Hg = 107.333 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 107.333 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 35 and 49 breaths per minute, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 11 + 3 = 14.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 14 + 8 = 22.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 22. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 22 + 4 = 26.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 26 = 41.0.

The HAS-BLED score includes the following factors: - H: Hypertension (Blood pressure > 160/90 mmHg or on treatment for hypertension) - A: Age ≥ 65 years - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding - L: Labile INR - E: Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or end-stage renal disease (not directly part of the HAS-BLED score as described in the note, but we'll check for renal function) - D: Diabetes However, the HAS-BLED score is typically defined as follows: - H: Hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) - A: Age > 65 years - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR - E: Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or end-stage renal disease - D: Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs) But for simplicity and based on the information provided, we will use the following components from the HAS-BLED score: - H: Hypertension (present) - A: Age ≥ 65 years (not present since the patient is 59 years old) - S: Stroke or TIA (present, as the patient has a history of stroke) - B: Bleeding (present, as there is a documented significant bleeding event) - L: Labile INR (present, as the INR was in the supra-therapeutic range nearly 80% of the time) - E: Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or end-stage renal disease (not mentioned, and renal function tests are normal) - D: Diabetes (not mentioned) Now let's score each component: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has uncontrolled hypertension (182/111), so this is present. Score = 1. 2. **A: Age ≥ 65 years** - The patient is 59 years old, so this is not present. Score = 0. 3. **S: Stroke or TIA** - The patient has a history of stroke. Score = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding** - There is a documented significant bleeding event following a minor operative procedure. Score = 1. 5. **L: Labile INR** - The INR was in the supra-therapeutic range nearly 80% of the time, indicating a labile INR. Score = 1. 6. **E: Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or end-stage renal disease** - The renal function tests are normal, so this is not present. Score = 0. 7. **D: Diabetes** - Not mentioned in the note. We will assume it is not present unless stated otherwise. Score = 0. Now, let's add up the scores: - H: 1 - A: 0 - S: 1 - B: 1 - L: 1 - E: 0 - D: 0 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4. So the patient's HAS-BLED score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we need to evaluate the following components: H (Hypertension), A (Age ≥ 65), S (Stroke or TIA), B (Bleeding), L (Labile INR), E (Creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL or end-stage renal disease), and D (Diabetes). \n\nFrom the patient note:\n- H (Hypertension): The patient has uncontrolled hypertension (182/111), so this is present.

Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 556 msec.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '466.934', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).\nThe patient's heart rate is 170 beats per minute.\nThe QT interval is 330 msec.\nThe RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/170 = 0.353.\nHence, plugging in these values, we will get 330/√(0.353) = 466.934.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 466.934 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **C (Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction):** Not mentioned in the note. Score = 0. 2. **H (Hypertension):** Not mentioned in the note. Score = 0. 3. **A (Age ≥ 65):** The patient is 55 years old, which is less than 65. Score = 0. 4. **D (Diabetes Mellitus):** Not mentioned in the note. Score = 0. 5. **S (Stroke or TIA):** No mention of stroke or TIA. Score = 0. 6. **V (Vascular Disease):** No mention of vascular disease. Score = 0. 7. **A (Age 55-74):** The patient is 55 years old, which falls within the age range of 55-74. Score = 1. 8. **S (Sex category: Female):** The patient is male. Score = 0. Now let's add up the scores: - Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (C): 0 - Hypertension (H): 0 - Age ≥ 75 (A): 0 (since the patient is 55, this category does not apply) - Diabetes Mellitus (D): 0 - Stroke or TIA (S): 0 - Vascular Disease (V): 0 - Age 65-74 (A): 1 (since the patient is 55, this category does not apply directly to the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system as it has separate categories for age ranges) - Sex category: Female (S): 0 (since the patient is male) It seems I made an error in the categorization. Let's use the correct CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system: CHA2DS2-VASc Score components: - C: Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (1 point) - H: Hypertension (1 point) - A2: Age ≥ 75 years (2 points) - D: Diabetes Mellitus (1 point) - S2: Stroke or TIA (2 points) - V: Vascular Disease (1 point) - A: Age 65-74 years (1 point) - S: Sex category: Female (1 point) Let's calculate it step by step: 1. **Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (C):** Not mentioned. Score = 0. 2. **Hypertension (H):** Not mentioned. Score = 0. 3. **Age ≥ 75 years (A2):** The patient is 55 years old, so this is not applicable. Score = 0. 4. **Diabetes Mellitus (D):** Not mentioned. Score = 0. 5. **Stroke or TIA (S2):** Not mentioned. Score = 0. 6. **Vascular Disease (V):** Not mentioned. Score = 0. 7. **Age 65-74 years (A):** The patient is 55 years old, so this is not applicable. Score = 0. 8. **Sex category: Female (S):** The patient is male. Score = 0. So the total score is: 0 (C) + 0 (H) + 0 (A2) + 0 (D) + 0 (S2) + 0 (V) + 0 (A) + 0 (S) = 0. It seems I made an incorrect assumption about the age category. Let's use the correct scoring for the age range for males. For males, the CHA2DS2-VASc score includes: - Age 65-74: 1 point - Age ≥ 75: 2 points Since the patient is 55 years old, he doesn't fall into either of these age categories that give points. Thus the correct breakdown is: - Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction: 0 - Hypertension: 0 - Age ≥ 75: 0 - Diabetes Mellitus: 0 - Stroke or TIA: 0 - Vascular Disease: 0 - Age 65-74: 0 (since the patient is 55) - Sex category: Female: 0 (since the patient is male) So the total CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. Therefore, the CHA2DS2-VASc score for this patient is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for the patient, we need to evaluate each component of the score based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n1. **C (Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction):** Not mentioned in the note.

Calculate the Child-Pugh Score: Based on the given values: - Serum bilirubin: 40.2 μmol/L = 3 points - Serum albumin: 3.1 g/dL = 1 point - Ascites: Absent = 1 point - INR: 2.1 = 3 points Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 </think> Now let's convert the bilirubin value from μmol/L to mg/dL to use the correct scoring system. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 17.1 μmol/L. Therefore, 40.2 μmol/L = 40.2 / 17.1 ≈ 2.35 mg/dL. Since the serum bilirubin is ≥ 2 mg/dL, it corresponds to 3 points. Now we can assign the points for each criterion: - Serum bilirubin: ≥ 2 mg/dL, so 3 points. - Serum albumin: 3.1 g/dL. This falls between 2.8-3.4 g/dL, so it gets 2 points. - Ascites: The note says "negative for ascites," so it is absent. Therefore, 1 point. - INR: 2.1. Since it is ≥ 2, it gets 3 points. Now we add up the points: - Serum bilirubin: 3 points - Serum albumin: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - INR: 3 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 9. So the Child-Pugh Score is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: serum bilirubin, serum albumin, ascites, and INR. \n\n1.

Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.', 'Question': 'What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?', 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '2', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To determine the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient: The criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) are: 1.

Therefore, we cannot say that the fourth criterion is met.\\n\\nSo, the patient meets two criteria: body temperature and respiratory rate.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's heart rate is 68.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 36.3 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

The general conversion factor is that 5 mg of Prednisone is roughly equivalent to 25 mg of Hydrocortisone. This means that 1 mg of Prednisone is approximately equal to 5 mg of Hydrocortisone. To find the equivalent dosage of Prednisone PO for 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV, we use the conversion factor: \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose (mg)} = \frac{\text{Hydrocortisone dose (mg)}}{5} \] Let's calculate this step-by-step.

Conversion factors: - Fentanyl patch: 1 mcg/hour of fentanyl patch is approximately equivalent to 10 mg of oral morphine. However, the conversion for the total mg of a fentanyl patch to MME is different. Typically, 100 mcg/hour fentanyl patch is equivalent to about 25 mg of oral morphine. For simplicity and common conversion, 1 mg of fentanyl patch is roughly equivalent to 25-50 mg of oral morphine. Let's use the conversion factor that 1 mg of fentanyl patch is approximately 30 mg of oral morphine. - Hydrocodone (Hydromorphone): 1 mg of hydromorphone is approximately equivalent to 4 mg of oral morphine. - Fentanyl Buccal: 1 mcg of buccal fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 10-15 mg of oral morphine. For simplicity, let's use the conversion factor that 1 mg of buccal fentanyl is approximately 100 mg of oral morphine. Now let's calculate the MME for each medication separately. 1. **Fentanyl Patch (60 mg/day):** - Conversion factor: 1 mg of fentanyl patch ≈ 30 mg of oral morphine. - Therefore, 60 mg of fentanyl patch = 60 mg * 30 = 1800 mg of oral morphine. 2. **Hydromorphone (20 mg, 3 times a day):** - Total daily dose = 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg/day. - Conversion factor: 1 mg of hydromorphone ≈ 4 mg of oral morphine. - Therefore, 60 mg of hydromorphone = 60 mg * 4 = 240 mg of oral morphine. 3. **Fentanyl Buccal (30 mg, 2 times a day):** - Total daily dose = 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg/day. - Conversion factor: 1 mg of buccal fentanyl ≈ 100 mg of oral morphine. - Therefore, 60 mg of buccal fentanyl = 60 mg * 100 = 6000 mg of oral morphine. Now, we add up all the MMEs from each medication to get the total daily MME. Total MME = MME from Fentanyl Patch + MME from Hydromorphone + MME from Fentanyl Buccal Total MME = 1800 mg (from Fentanyl Patch) + 240 mg (from Hydromorphone) + 6000 mg (from Fentanyl Buccal) Total MME = 1800 + 240 + 6000 = 8040 mg. So the total daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 8040 mg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the total daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), I will convert each medication to its MME equivalent using the following steps:\n\n1. **Fentanyl Patch (60 mg/day):**\n - Conversion factor: 1 mg of fentanyl patch ≈ 30 mg of oral morphine.\n - Therefore, 60 mg of fentanyl patch = 60 mg * 30 = 1800 mg of oral morphine.\n\n2. **Hydromorphone (20 mg, 3 times a day):**\n - Total daily dose = 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg/day.\n - Conversion factor: 1 mg of hydromorphone ≈ 4 mg of oral morphine.\n - Therefore, 60 mg of hydromorphone = 60 mg * 4 = 240 mg of oral morphine.\n\n3. **Fentanyl Buccal (30 mg, 2 times a day):**\n - Total daily dose = 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg/day.\n - Conversion factor: 1 mg of buccal fentanyl ≈ 100 mg of oral morphine.\n - Therefore, 60 mg of buccal fentanyl = 60 mg * 100 = 6000 mg of oral morphine.\n\nNow, we add up all the MMEs from each medication to get the total daily MME.\nTotal MME = MME from Fentanyl Patch + MME from Hydromorphone + MME from Fentanyl Buccal\nTotal MME = 1800 mg (from Fentanyl Patch) + 240 mg (from Hydromorphone) + 6000 mg (from Fentanyl Buccal)\nTotal MME = 1800 + 240 + 6000 = 8040 mg.", "answer": "8040"}

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Step 1: Identify the components of the CURB-65 score from the patient note. - **Confusion**: The patient note does not explicitly mention confusion. The patient has symptoms like fever, rigors, and generalized weakness, but there's no mention of confusion or altered mental status. Therefore, we'll assume no confusion is present. - **Uremia (BUN/Creatinine ratio or serum creatinine level)**: The patient's BUN is 21 and creatinine is 1.0. The BUN/creatinine ratio is 21 / 1.0 = 21. Typically, a high BUN/creatinine ratio can indicate uremia, but the threshold for uremia in the CURB-65 score is usually defined by the serum creatinine level. The normal range for serum creatinine varies but is generally around 0.6-1.2 mg/dL for men. Since the patient's creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, it is within the normal range. Therefore, we will consider this as not meeting the criterion for uremia. - **Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute**: The patient's respiratory rate (RR) is 19 breaths per minute. Since 19 is less than 30, this criterion is not met. - **Blood pressure (BP) < 90 systolic or < 60 diastolic**: The patient's BP is 121/79. Both the systolic (121) and diastolic (79) blood pressures are within the normal range and do not meet the criteria for low blood pressure. - **Age ≥ 65 years**: The patient is 41 years old. Since 41 is less than 65, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria that the patient meets: - Confusion: No - Uremia: No - Respiratory rate ≥ 30: No - Blood pressure < 90 systolic or < 60 diastolic: No - Age ≥ 65: No Since none of the criteria are met, the CURB-65 score is 0. Therefore, the CURB-65 score for this patient is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to evaluate the following components: \n1. Confusion: The patient note does not mention any confusion or altered mental status. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n2. Uremia: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n3. Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is below 30. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n4. Blood pressure < 90 systolic or < 60 diastolic: The patient's BP is 121/79, which is within the normal range. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n5. Age ≥ 65: The patient is 41 years old, which is less than 65. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\nSince none of the criteria are met, the CURB-65 score is 0.", "answer": "0"}

The conversion factors are as follows: - Hydrocodone: 1 mg of HYDROmorphone is approximately equivalent to 4-8 mg of Morphine. Let's use the commonly accepted conversion factor of 4 mg of Morphine per 1 mg of HYDROmorphone. - Fentanyl: 100 mcg (0.1 mg) of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 25-30 mg of Morphine. Therefore, 1 mg of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 250-300 mg of Morphine. Let's use the conversion factor of 250 mg of Morphine per 1 mg of Fentanyl. - Tramadol: 100 mg of Tramadol is approximately equivalent to 10 mg of Morphine. Therefore, 1 mg of Tramadol is approximately equivalent to 0.1 mg of Morphine. Now let's calculate the MME for each medication separately. 1. HYDROmorphone: The patient takes 10 mg of HYDROmorphone 1 time a day. - Conversion factor: 1 mg of HYDROmorphone = 4 mg of Morphine. - Therefore, 10 mg of HYDROmorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 mg of Morphine. - Since it's taken 1 time a day, the daily MME from HYDROmorphone is 40 mg. 2. Fentanyl patch: The patient takes 40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day. - Conversion factor: 1 mg of Fentanyl = 250 mg of Morphine. - Therefore, 40 mg of Fentanyl = 40 * 250 = 10000 mg of Morphine. - Since it's taken 3 times a day, the daily MME from Fentanyl is 10000 mg * 3 = 30000 mg. 3. Tramadol: The patient takes 60 mg of Tramadol 2 times a day. - Conversion factor: 1 mg of Tramadol = 0.1 mg of Morphine. - Therefore, 60 mg of Tramadol = 60 * 0.1 = 6 mg of Morphine. - Since it's taken 2 times a day, the daily MME from Tramadol is 6 mg * 2 = 12 mg. Now, we add up the MME from all three medications to get the total daily MME. Total MME = MME from HYDROmorphone + MME from Fentanyl + MME from Tramadol Total MME = 40 mg + 30000 mg + 12 mg = 30052 mg. It seems there might be an issue with the given information about the Fentanyl patch. Typically, Fentanyl patches are not prescribed in such high doses and frequencies. A Fentanyl patch is usually applied every 72 hours (every 3 days), and the dose is not taken multiple times a day. Let's assume the patient is using Fentanyl patches and correct the approach. Let's assume the 40 mg Fentanyl patch is applied every 72 hours (every 3 days), and the dose is continuous over that period. The daily dose from a Fentanyl patch is calculated differently. The typical conversion for a Fentanyl patch is that a 40 mcg/hour patch delivers 40 mcg/hour continuously. To convert this to a daily dose: 1. A 40 mcg/hour patch delivers 40 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 960 mcg/day = 0.96 mg/day. If the patient has a 40 mg Fentanyl patch, this is likely a typo or misunderstanding. Let's assume the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch. The conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME is that 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 9 mg of Morphine per day. So, for a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch: - Daily MME from a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch = 40 mcg/hour * 9 mg/Morphine per mcg/hour = 360 mg of Morphine per day. Since the patient is using the patch 3 times a day, this implies that the patient is applying a new patch every 8 hours (since 24 hours / 3 = 8 hours). This is unusual for Fentanyl patches, which are typically applied every 72 hours. Let's assume the patient is using three different 40 mcg/hour patches over 24 hours. If the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour patch and applying it every 8 hours, the total daily MME would be the MME from one patch times the number of patches applied in a day. Since each 40 mcg/hour patch delivers 360 mg of Morphine per day, and if the patient applies 3 patches in a day (each for 8 hours), the total MME from Fentanyl would be: Total MME from Fentanyl = 360 mg (MME from one patch for 24 hours). But since the patches are applied every 8 hours, we need to calculate the MME for the overlapping doses. Let's simplify this by assuming the patient is using a total dose equivalent to the sum of the patches applied over 24 hours. If the patient applies a 40 mcg/hour patch every 8 hours, the total dose over 24 hours is effectively the sum of the doses from each patch over its duration. Since each patch delivers 40 mcg/hour continuously, over 8 hours, one patch delivers: 40 mcg/hour * 8 hours = 320 mcg. Since the patient applies 3 such patches in 24 hours, the total dose over 24 hours is: 320 mcg * 3 = 960 mcg = 0.96 mg. Now, converting this total daily dose to MME: Using the conversion factor that 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 9 mg of Morphine per day for a continuous 24-hour dose: For a 40 mcg/hour patch, the daily MME is 360 mg (as calculated earlier). So the total MME from the Fentanyl patches is 360 mg. Now let's calculate the total MME again with the corrected approach: 1. HYDROmorphone: 10 mg taken 1 time a day. - Conversion: 1 mg of HYDROmorphone = 4 mg of Morphine. - Therefore, 10 mg of HYDROmorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 mg of Morphine. - Daily MME from HYDROmorphone = 40 mg. 2. Fentanyl patch: Let's assume it's a 40 mcg/hour patch applied every 72 hours. - Conversion: A 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch is approximately equivalent to 360 mg of Morphine per day. - Since the patch is applied every 72 hours (every 3 days), the daily MME contribution from the patch is 360 mg. But since the problem states the patient takes the Fentanyl patch 3 times a day, let's assume it's a typo and that the patient is using a total dose equivalent to 3 times the dose of a single patch over 24 hours. If the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour patch and applying it every 8 hours, the total daily MME from Fentanyl is: 360 mg (from one patch for 24 hours). 3. Tramadol: 60 mg taken 2 times a day. - Conversion: 1 mg of Tramadol = 0.1 mg of Morphine. - Therefore, 60 mg of Tramadol = 60 * 0.1 = 6 mg of Morphine. - Since it's taken 2 times a day, the daily MME from Tramadol is 6 mg * 2 = 12 mg. Now, adding up the MME from all medications: Total MME = MME from HYDROmorphone + MME from Fentanyl + MME from Tramadol Total MME = 40 mg + 360 mg + 12 mg = 412 mg. So the total daily MME is 412 mg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the total daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), I will convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

The patient's height is 168 cm and weight is 68 kg. Let's calculate the BMI: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}} = \frac{68}{(1.68)^{2}} = \frac{68}{2.8224} \approx 24.09. \] Since the BMI is approximately 24.09, which is within the normal range (normal BMI range is 18.5 - 24.9), we will use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight for the adjusted body weight. To calculate the ideal body weight (IBW), we use the formula for men: \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight (IBW)} = 50 + 0.9 \times (\text{Height in cm} - 152). \] Plugging in the height: \[ \text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \times (168 - 152) = 50 + 0.9 \times 16 = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 \, \text{kg}. \] Since the actual weight is 68 kg and the ideal body weight is 64.4 kg, the adjusted body weight will be the minimum of the two, which is 64.4 kg. Now we can use the Cockroft-Gault Equation with the adjusted body weight of 64.4 kg. The Cockroft-Gault Equation is: \[ \text{CrCl} = \frac{(140 - \text{Age}) \times \text{Adjusted Body Weight}}{72 \times \text{Serum Creatinine}}. \] Plugging in the values: - Age = 66 years - Adjusted Body Weight = 64.4 kg - Serum Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL \[ \text{CrCl} = \frac{(140 - 66) \times 64.4}{72 \times 5.09}. \] Calculate the numerator: \[ (140 - 66) = 74, \] \[ 74 \times 64.4 = 4763.6. \] Now calculate the denominator: \[ 72 \times 5.09 = 365.28. \] Now divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{CrCl} = \frac{4763.6}{365.28} \approx 12.99 \, \text{mL/min}. \] Rounding to two decimal places, the CrCl is approximately 13.0 mL/min. So the final answer is approximately 13 mL/min. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

{'Row Number': 515, 'Calculator Name': 'LDL Calculated', 'Calculator ID': '44', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-3221905-1', 'Patient Note': "A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation. This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital. Here is the task: What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate serum osmolality, the formula is: Serum osmolality = 2 (Sodium) + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8 Given values: - Sodium = 136 mmol/L - Glucose = 517 mg/dL - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) = 25.9 mg/dL Calculations: Serum osmolality = (2 * 136) + (517/18) + (25.9/2.8) = 272 + 28.76 + 9.25 = 310 </think> However, I should use the values from the time when the patient was admitted to the emergency unit for the initial assessment. The initial values given for the patient on admission are: - Sodium: 133 mmol/L - Glucose: 569 mg/dL - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25.9 mg/dL Let's use these values to calculate the serum osmolality. The formula for serum osmolality is: \[ \text{Serum osmolality} = 2 \times \text{[Na]} + \text{[Glucose]/18} + \text{[BUN]/2.8} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{[Na]} = 133 \, \text{mmol/L} \] \[ \text{[Glucose]} = 569 \, \text{mg/dL} \] \[ \text{[BUN]} = 25.9 \, \text{mg/dL} \] Now, let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate \( 2 \times \text{[Na]} \): \[ 2 \times 133 = 266 \] 2. Calculate \(\text{[Glucose]}/18\): \[ \frac{569}{18} \approx 31.61 \] 3. Calculate \(\text{[BUN]}/2.8\): \[ \frac{25.9}{2.8} \approx 9.25 \] Now, add these values together: \[ \text{Serum osmolality} = 266 + 31.61 + 9.25 \] Adding them up: \[ 266 + 31.61 = 297.61 \] \[ 297.61 + 9.25 = 306.86 \] So the serum osmolality is approximately 307 mOsm/kg. Now let's use the values from the time after the return of spontaneous circulation to calculate the serum osmolality at that point. The values after the return of spontaneous circulation are: - Sodium: 136 mmol/L - Glucose: 517 mg/dL - BUN: not provided directly, but we can use the BUN value from the initial assessment if it's assumed to be relatively stable or use the value from the initial assessment for consistency. Let's use the BUN value from the initial assessment (25.9 mg/dL). Using the formula again with these values: \[ \text{[Na]} = 136 \, \text{mmol/L} \] \[ \text{[Glucose]} = 517 \, \text{mg/dL} \] \[ \text{[BUN]} = 25.9 \, \text{mg/dL} \] Now, let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate \( 2 \times \text{[Na]} \): \[ 2 \times 136 = 272 \] 2. Calculate \(\text{[Glucose]}/18\): \[ \frac{517}{18} \approx 28.72 \] 3. Calculate \(\text{[BUN]}/2.8\): \[ \frac{25.9}{2.8} \approx 9.25 \] Now, add these values together: \[ \text{Serum osmolality} = 272 + 28.72 + 9.25 \] Adding them up: \[ 272 + 28.72 = 300.72 \] \[ 300.72 + 9.25 = 309.97 \] So the serum osmolality after the return of spontaneous circulation is approximately 310 mOsm/kg. Since the question does not specify which set of values to use, I will use the initial values for the calculation as they are the first set of values provided. Thus, the serum osmolality using the initial values is approximately 307 mOsm/kg. So the final answer is 307 mOsm/kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate serum osmolality, we use the formula: Serum osmolality = 2 * [Na] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

First, we need to calculate the RR interval from the given heart rate. The heart rate is 144 bpm. The formula to calculate the RR interval is RR = 60 / Heart Rate. Therefore, RR = 60 / 144 ≈ 0.4167 seconds. Next, we use the given QT interval, which is 330 msec, and the calculated RR interval to find the corrected QT interval (QTc). The formula for the corrected QT interval using the Framingham method is QTc = QT / √RR. Substituting the values, we get QTc = 330 / √0.4167. The square root of 0.4167 is approximately 0.6455. Therefore, QTc ≈ 330 / 0.6455 ≈ 511.2 msec. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 511 msec. However, I will use the more precise calculation to ensure accuracy. √0.4167 ≈ 0.6455, so QTc ≈ 330 / 0.6455 ≈ 511.2 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 511 msec.", "answer": "511"} It seems I made an error in the previous thinking process. Let's correct it step-by-step. 1. The given heart rate is 144 bpm. 2. The given QT interval is 330 msec. To calculate the RR interval in seconds, we use the formula: RR = 60 / Heart Rate. So, RR = 60 / 144 ≈ 0.4167 seconds. Now, we use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc): QTc = QT / √RR Substitute the values into the formula: QTc = 330 / √0.4167 Calculate the square root of 0.4167: √0.4167 ≈ 0.6455 Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc ≈ 330 / 0.6455 ≈ 511.2 Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 511 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 511 msec. So the final answer is 511. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula, we need to use the formula: QTc = QT / √(RR), where QT is the measured QT interval and RR is the RR interval in seconds.

Given the heart rate is 144 bpm and the QT interval is 330 msec, we can proceed as follows: Step 1: Calculate the RR interval. Heart rate = 144 bpm RR = 60 / 144 ≈ 0.4167 seconds.

Add 9 months to the result. </think> However, since the cycle length is given as 25 days instead of the standard 28 days, we need to adjust the calculation based on the cycle length. Step 1: Calculate the estimated due date using the standard Naegele's Rule for a 28-day cycle and then adjust it for the 25-day cycle. Using Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle: - Add 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (04/09/2021). - Add 9 months to the resulting date. Adding 7 days to 04/09/2021: \[ 04/09/2021 + 7 \text{ days} = 04/16/2021. \] Now, add 9 months to 04/16/2021: Adding 9 months to April 16, 2021, takes us to January 16, 2022. So, the estimated due date using the standard 28-day cycle is 01/16/2022. Now, we need to adjust this due date for a 25-day cycle instead of a 28-day cycle. The difference between the standard cycle (28 days) and the patient's cycle (25 days) is: \[ 28 - 25 = 3 \text{ days.} \] Since the patient's cycle is shorter by 3 days, the pregnancy will likely be shorter by approximately the same amount. Therefore, we need to subtract these 3 days from the estimated due date calculated using the 28-day cycle. Subtract 3 days from 01/16/2022: \[ 01/16/2022 - 3 \text{ days} = 01/13/2022. \] Thus, the estimated due date for the patient with a 25-day cycle is 01/13/2022. So the final answer is 01/13/2022. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle, we first add 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), which is 04/09/2021.

Therefore, the estimated due date using the standard 28-day cycle is 01/16/2022. Since the patient has a cycle length of 25 days, which is 3 days shorter than the standard 28-day cycle, we need to adjust the due date by subtracting these 3 days from the estimated due date calculated using the 28-day cycle. Subtracting 3 days from 01/16/2022 gives us 01/13/2022. Therefore, the adjusted estimated due date for the patient is 01/13/2022.", "answer": "01/13/2022"}

The corrected sodium concentration is already given in the note as: "Na+: 139 mEq/L" </think> However, to ensure that we're calculating the corrected sodium concentration properly, we need to consider if there's any condition that would require a correction to the sodium level. The patient has a few symptoms and conditions that might suggest a need for correction, such as hypothyroidism (fatigue, constipation, weight gain), anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, which is low), and possibly other conditions. But the most common reason to correct sodium levels is in the presence of hyperglycemia or hyperproteinemia because these conditions can cause a pseudohyponatremia (a falsely low sodium level). Let's check if we need to correct the sodium level for hyperglycemia. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 2.75 or 2.8 The patient's glucose level is 129 mg/dL. Using the formula: Corrected Sodium = 139 + (129 - 100) / 2.75 Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Calculate the difference between the glucose level and 100 mg/dL. 129 - 100 = 29 Step 2: Divide this difference by 2.75. 29 / 2.75 ≈ 10.545 Step 3: Add this result to the measured sodium level. Corrected Sodium = 139 + 10.545 ≈ 149.545 Rounded to the nearest whole number, the corrected sodium is approximately 149.5 mEq/L. However, let's also consider if there's any other condition that might require correction. The patient has symptoms like fatigue, constipation, and weight gain, which could suggest hypothyroidism. If the patient has hypothyroidism, it can cause a decrease in serum sodium levels due to increased water retention. But the question asks for the corrected sodium concentration, and the most common correction is for hyperglycemia. Given the information provided, the only correction we can make based on the available data is for hyperglycemia. So the corrected sodium concentration is approximately 149.5 mEq/L. But let's also check if the patient's condition might suggest another correction. The patient has a low hemoglobin level (10.0 g/dL), which indicates anemia. Anemia can sometimes affect the sodium level, but the correction for anemia is not as straightforward as the correction for hyperglycemia. Since the primary correction we can apply based on the given data is for hyperglycemia, we will use the corrected sodium concentration from the hyperglycemia correction. Thus, the corrected sodium concentration is approximately 149.5 mEq/L. So the final answer is 149.5 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we use the formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia since the patient has a glucose level of 129 mg/dL, which is above the normal range.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Let's correct this step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the comorbidities from the patient's note and their corresponding Charlson Comorbidity Index scores. - **Hepatoblastoma**: This is a type of cancer. The Charlson Comorbidity Index includes "Malignant neoplasm" (cancer), which has a score of 6. - **Leukemia**: This is also a type of cancer. It falls under the "Malignant neoplasm" category, which has a score of 6. - **Congestive Heart Failure**: This condition corresponds to "Congestive heart failure," which has a score of 1. - **Type II Diabetes Mellitus**: The Charlson Comorbidity Index includes "Diabetes mellitus" without end-organ damage, which has a score of 1. - **Dementia**: This condition has a score of 1. - **Severe liver disease**: The patient presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease. Severe liver disease corresponds to "Chronic liver disease," which has a score of 3. - **Connective tissue disease**: This is not explicitly listed in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. However, it can sometimes be considered under "Rheumatoid arthritis" or "Connective tissue disease," which is not included in the standard Charlson Comorbidity Index. For the sake of this calculation, we will not include it unless it has a specific impact that is listed in the Charlson Index. Now, let's list the comorbidities and their scores: - Malignant neoplasm (Hepatoblastoma and Leukemia): Since both are types of cancer, they fall under the "Malignant neoplasm" category. The Charlson Comorbidity Index counts malignant neoplasms only once, and it has a score of 6. - Congestive Heart Failure: Score = 1 - Diabetes Mellitus: Score = 1 - Dementia: Score = 1 - Severe liver disease (Chronic liver disease): Score = 3 Now, let's sum up the scores: - Malignant neoplasm: 6 - Congestive Heart Failure: 1 - Diabetes Mellitus: 1 - Dementia: 1 - Chronic liver disease: 3 Adding these scores together: \[ 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 \] So the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for this patient is 12. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), I identified the relevant comorbidities from the patient's note and their corresponding scores in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The identified comorbidities and their scores are as follows:\n- Malignant neoplasm (Hepatoblastoma and Leukemia): 6 (since both are cancers and counted as one under 'Malignant neoplasm')\n- Congestive Heart Failure: 1\n- Diabetes Mellitus: 1\n- Dementia: 1\n- Severe liver disease (Chronic liver disease): 3\n\nNow, I sum up these scores: 6 (Malignant neoplasm) + 1 (Congestive Heart Failure) + 1 (Diabetes Mellitus) + 1 (Dementia) + 3 (Chronic liver disease) = 12.\nTherefore, the Charlson Comorbidity Index for this patient is 12.", "answer": "12"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

<think> To calculate the maintenance fluid requirement, the general rule of thumb is: - 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg of body weight, - 2 mL/kg/hr for the next 10 kg, - 1 mL/kg/hr for each kilogram above 20 kg. Given the patient weighs 30 kg: - For the first 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 40 mL/hr - For the next 10 kg: 2 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 20 mL/hr - For the remaining 10 kg: 1 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 10 mL/hr Total maintenance fluid requirement = 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 10 mL/hr = 70 mL/hr </think>

{'Row Number': 334, 'Calculator Name': 'Maintenance Fluids Calculations', 'Calculator ID': '22', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5970484-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.', 'Question': "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '70', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' To calculate the maintenance fluid requirement, the general rule of thumb is: - 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg of body weight, - 2 mL/kg/hr for the next 10 kg, - 1 mL/kg/hr for each kilogram above 20 kg.

However, Naegele's Rule assumes a standard 28-day cycle. Since the cycle length is given as 30 days, we will use the standard Naegele's Rule for a 28-day cycle and then adjust if necessary. Step 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP (03/24/2017). Adding 7 days to 03/24/2017: \[ 03/24/2017 + 7 \, \text{days} = 03/31/2017. \] Step 2: Add 9 months to 03/31/2017. Adding 9 months to 03/31/2017: If we add 9 months to March 31st, we move to December 31st of the same year because: - March + 9 months = December. - So, 03/31/2017 + 9 months = 12/31/2017. Thus, the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule is 12/31/2017. Since the cycle length is 30 days instead of the standard 28 days, we need to adjust the due date. Naegele's Rule assumes a 28-day cycle. For a cycle that is longer than 28 days, the estimated due date would be later. To adjust for a 30-day cycle: The difference between the cycle length and the standard 28-day cycle is 2 days. Since the cycle is 2 days longer than the standard cycle, the ovulation and conception would be delayed by approximately 2 days compared to a 28-day cycle. To adjust the due date: Since the cycle is 2 days longer, the pregnancy would be extended by those 2 days. So, we add 2 days to the due date calculated using Naegele's Rule (which is 12/31/2017). Adding 2 days to 12/31/2017: \[ 12/31/2017 + 2 \, \text{days} = 01/02/2018. \] Therefore, the adjusted estimated due date for a 30-day cycle is 01/02/2018. So the final estimated due date is 01/02/2018. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule: \n1.

It considers five clinical parameters: 1. Serum bilirubin levels 2. Serum albumin levels 3. INR (International Normalized Ratio) 4. Prothrombin time 5. Encephalopathy grade </think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the parameters from the given patient note. - Serum Bilirubin: The patient's bilirubin level is 1.9 mg/dL. - Serum Albumin: The patient's albumin level is 3.3 g/dL. - INR: The patient's INR is 1.6. - Encephalopathy Grade: The patient has stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. We don't have the prothrombin time directly, but the INR is given, which is related to the prothrombin time and can be used for the Child-Pugh score. Now let's assign scores to each parameter according to the Child-Pugh classification: 1. **Serum Bilirubin:** - < 2 mg/dL: 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL: 2 points - 3-6 mg/dL: 3 points - > 6 mg/dL: 4 points The patient's bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls into the range < 2 mg/dL. Therefore, the score for serum bilirubin is 1 point. 2. **Serum Albumin:** - > 3.5 g/dL: 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL: 2 points - 2.1-2.8 g/dL: 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL: 4 points The patient's albumin is 3.3 g/dL, which falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL. Therefore, the score for serum albumin is 2 points. 3. **INR (or Prothrombin Time):** - < 1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - > 3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.6, which is < 1.7. Therefore, the score for INR is 1 point. 4. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Controlled with medication: 2 points - Refractory to medication: 3 points The patient note does not mention ascites. Since it is not mentioned, we will assume there is no ascites or that it is controlled without specific mention of refractory ascites. Therefore, we'll assign the score for ascites as 1 point (assuming no ascites). 5. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade I-II: 2 points - Grade III-IV: 3 points The patient has stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy, which corresponds to Grade III-IV. Therefore, the score for encephalopathy is 3 points. Now, let's add up the scores for each parameter: - Serum Bilirubin: 1 point - Serum Albumin: 2 points - INR: 1 point - Ascites: 1 point - Encephalopathy: 3 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 points. The Child-Pugh Score is 8. According to the Child-Pugh classification, the scores are categorized as follows: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 8, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. Therefore, the Child-Pugh Score is 8. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters from the patient note: Serum Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, INR, Ascites, and Encephalopathy.\n\n1.

Step 1: Identify the LMP, which is 10/11/2020. Step 2: Calculate the estimated date of ovulation. Since the cycle length is 29 days, ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of the cycle. For a cycle that starts on the LMP, ovulation would occur approximately 14 days before the next expected period. To find the day of ovulation relative to the LMP, we subtract the number of days from the cycle length to get the day of ovulation from the LMP. Ovulation usually happens about halfway through the cycle, which is approximately cycle length - 14 days after the LMP. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation occurs around day 14 or 15 after the LMP (since the cycle starts on the first day of the LMP). So, to find the date of ovulation: The LMP is October 11, 2020. To find the date 14 or 15 days after the LMP for a 29-day cycle, we calculate the date 14 or 15 days after the LMP. Let's calculate the date 14 days after the LMP (October 11, 2020). Adding 14 days to October 11, 2020: October has 31 days. If we add 14 days to October 11, 2020: October 11 + 14 days. Counting forward from October 11: - October 11 + 20 days in October = October 25 (since 31 - 11 = 20 days remaining in October, and adding 14 days to October 11 means we add up within October). Adding 14 days to October 11: October 11 + 14 = October 25. So, the estimated date of ovulation (and thus the estimated date of conception) is October 25, 2020. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is October 25, 2020. The answer is 10/25/2020. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated date of conception, I use the rule that conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation, which is approximately 14 days after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) for a regular cycle. The patient's LMP was on 10/11/2020, and her cycle length is 29 days. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation usually occurs around day 15 of the cycle (since ovulation is typically mid-cycle). To find the date of ovulation, I add approximately 14 days to the LMP. Adding 14 days to October 11, 2020: \nOctober 11 + 14 days = October 25, 2020. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is October 25, 2020.", "answer": "10/25/2020"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

The initial anion gap was 20.8 mEq/L, and on day two following admission, the anion gap was 16.2 mEq/L. To calculate the Delta Gap between the initial anion gap and the anion gap on day two: Delta Gap = Current Gap (on day 2) - Initial Gap Delta Gap = 16.2 mEq/L - 20.8 mEq/L Delta Gap = -4.6 mEq/L So the change in the anion gap from the initial measurement to the measurement on day two is -4.6 mEq/L. However, the question seems to be asking for the change in the anion gap between two points, but it doesn't specify which two points. Let's consider the change between the initial anion gap and the final anion gap mentioned. The initial anion gap is 20.8 mEq/L. On day 2, the anion gap is 16.2 mEq/L. On day 3, the anion gap is 13.2 mEq/L. Let's calculate the change between the initial anion gap and the anion gap on day 3: Delta Gap = Anion gap on day 3 - Initial anion gap Delta Gap = 13.2 mEq/L - 20.8 mEq/L Delta Gap = -7.6 mEq/L But if the task is to find the change between the initial anion gap and the anion gap on day 2: Delta Gap = Anion gap on day 2 - Initial anion gap Delta Gap = 16.2 mEq/L - 20.8 mEq/L Delta Gap = -4.6 mEq/L Since the question asks for the patient's delta gap in mEq/L without specifying the time points, I will assume it's asking for the change between the initial anion gap and the anion gap on day 2, as that is the first significant change mentioned after the initial measurement. Thus, the Delta Gap is -4.6 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Delta Gap, we need the difference between the anion gap at two different time points.

On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).\nDischarged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.', 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '-4.6', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' To calculate the Delta Gap, we need to know the formula: Delta Gap = Current Gap - Baseline Gap Given values: - Current Gap = 16.2 mEq/L - Baseline Gap = 20.8 mEq/L ', 'LLM Explanation': 'To calculate Delta Gap, subtract the Baseline Gap from the Current Gap.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '-4.6', 'Target Explanation': 'To calculate the Delta Gap, we need the difference between the anion gap at two different time points. The initial anion gap is given as 20.8 mEq/L. On day 2 following admission, the anion gap improved to 16.2 mEq/L. The Delta Gap between these two points is calculated as: Delta Gap = Anion gap on day 2 - Initial anion gap = 16.2 mEq/L - 20.8 mEq/L = -4.6 mEq/L. Therefore, the change in the anion gap from the initial measurement to the measurement on day 2 is -4.6 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise.

This counts as 1 point. 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function**: The patient has end-stage liver fibrosis (which indicates abnormal liver function). There is no mention of renal pathologies, so the renal function is not abnormal. However, since the liver function is abnormal, this counts as 1 point. 3. **S: Stroke**: There is no mention of a history of stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack). Therefore, this component scores 0 points. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition**: The patient has a history of a major bleeding episode in the past. This counts as 1 point. 5. **L: Labile INR**: There is no information provided about the patient's INR stability. Therefore, we cannot assign a point for this component. It scores 0 points. 6. **E: Elderly (age > 65 years)**: The patient is 67 years old, which is above 65 years. This counts as 1 point. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly**: The patient admits to mild alcohol consumption (about 3 drinks per week). While this is not heavy alcohol consumption, it still counts as a factor for the "Drugs/alcohol concomitantly" category. Therefore, this counts as 1 point. Now let's add up the points from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal renal/liver function): 1 point - S (Stroke): 0 points - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 1 point - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Elderly): 1 point - D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly): 1 point Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 0 (S) + 1 (B) + 0 (L) + 1 (E) + 1 (D) = 5 points.

A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment.

Now let's assign points to each criterion according to the Child-Pugh Score system: 1. Serum Bilirubin: The total bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Serum bilirubin < 2 mg/dL = Class A (1 point) - Serum bilirubin 2-3 mg/dL = Class B (2 points) - Serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL = Class C (3 points) Since the bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into Class A (1 point). 2. Serum Albumin: The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL = Class A (1 point) - Serum albumin 2.8-3.4 g/dL = Class B (2 points) - Serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL = Class C (3 points) Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls into Class B (2 points). 3. INR: The INR is 1.8. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - INR < 1.7 = Class A (1 point) - INR 1.7-2.3 = Class B (2 points) - INR > 2.3 = Class C (3 points) Since the INR is 1.8, it falls into Class B (2 points). 4. Ascites: There is no mention of ascites, so we will assume there is no ascites. - No ascites = Class A (1 point) - Mild ascites = Class B (2 points) - Moderate to severe ascites = Class C (3 points) Since there is no ascites, it falls into Class A (1 point). 5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech, indicating hepatic encephalopathy, likely Grade 1-2. - No encephalopathy = Class A (1 point) - Grade 1-2 encephalopathy = Class B (2 points) - Grade 3-4 encephalopathy = Class C (3 points) Since the patient has Grade 1-2 encephalopathy, it falls into Class B (2 points). Now we sum up the points for each criterion: - Serum Bilirubin: 1 point - Serum Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Hepatic Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8 points. To determine the Child-Pugh Class, we use the total score: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 8, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. However, the Child-Pugh score is typically reported as a class rather than a raw score. The raw score is used to determine the class. So the Child-Pugh Class is B. But the question asks for the Child-Pugh Score, which is the sum of the points. Thus, the Child-Pugh Score is 8. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient based on the following criteria: serum bilirubin, serum albumin, INR, presence of ascites, and presence of hepatic encephalopathy.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

The HEART score includes the following components: - H: History of chest pain - E: Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings - A: Age - R: Risk factors - T: Troponin levels However, the HEART score is typically used to assess the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients presenting with chest pain. The components are scored as follows: - History (H): The nature of the chest pain and its characteristics. - ECG (E): Presence of ischemic changes on the ECG. - Age (A): Age of the patient. - Risk factors (R): Presence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. - Troponin (T): Elevated troponin levels. Let's evaluate each component based on the given patient note. Step 1: History (H) The patient presented with acute chest pain and palpitations at rest. This is suggestive of a concerning history for ACS. Step 2: ECG (E) The ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL. These changes suggest ischemic changes. Step 3: Age (A) The patient is 35 years old. According to the HEART score, age is scored as follows: - Age < 45: 0 points - Age 45-64: 1 point - Age ≥ 65: 2 points Since the patient is 35 years old, he falls into the "< 45" category, which gives 0 points. Step 4: Risk factors (R) The patient has the following risk factors: - He smokes regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. - He has a history of taking medications like chlorpheniramine and propranolol, but these are not traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease. The risk factors for coronary artery disease include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease, and being over 45 for men or over 55 for women. Since the patient is a smoker, he has at least one significant risk factor for coronary artery disease. Therefore, this would likely contribute to the risk factor score. Step 5: Troponin (T) The patient note does not mention any information about troponin levels. If troponin levels are not elevated, this component would typically score 0. Now let's assign the scores for each component based on the HEART score system. For the History component (H): The patient has acute chest pain and palpitations at rest, which is concerning. This would typically score 2 points. For the ECG component (E): The ECG showed ST-segment depression and isolated ST elevation, indicating ischemic changes. This would typically score 2 points. For the Age component (A): Since the patient is 35 years old, this scores 0 points. For the Risk factors component (R): The patient is a smoker, which is a significant risk factor. This would typically score 1 point. For the Troponin component (T): Since there is no mention of elevated troponin levels, this scores 0 points. Now we add up the scores: H = 2 (for acute chest pain and palpitations) E = 2 (for ischemic changes on ECG) A = 0 (for age < 45) R = 1 (for smoking) T = 0 (no elevated troponin mentioned) Total HEART score = H + E + A + R + T = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5. Therefore, the patient's HEART score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score, we need to evaluate the following components: History (H), ECG (E), Age (A), Risk factors (R), and Troponin (T). \n\n1.

He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test.

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the SOFA score, the criteria are: - Systolic Blood Pressure: ≤ 65 - Respiratory Rate: ≥ 30 - Oxygen Requirement: FiO₂ ≥ 40% - Mental Status: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 15 - Kidney Function: Serum Creatinine ≥ 1.2 - White Blood Cell Count: ≤ 12,000 cells/mm^3 </think> But the SOFA score is actually calculated based on the following parameters: Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and CNS. Let's calculate the SOFA score step-by-step for each organ system. 1. **Respiratory:** - The score is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio. - Given: FiO₂ = 54%, PaO₂ = 76 mm Hg. - Calculate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: \[ \text{PaO₂/FiO₂} = \frac{76}{0.54} \approx 140.74. \] - The SOFA Respiratory score is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: Score = 0 - 300-400: Score = 1 - 200-300: Score = 2 - 100-200: Score = 3 - <100: Score = 4 - Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 140.74, it falls into the range 100-200. - Therefore, the Respiratory score is 3. 2. **Coagulation:** - The score is based on the Platelet count. - Given: Platelet count = 175,000/µL. - The SOFA Coagulation score is based on the platelet count: - > 150,000: Score = 0 - 100,000-150,000: Score = 1 - 50,000-100,000: Score = 2 - 20,000-50,000: Score = 3 - < 20,000: Score = 4 - Since the platelet count is 175,000/µL, it falls into the range > 150,000. - Therefore, the Coagulation score is 0. 3. **Liver:** - The score is based on the bilirubin level. - Given: Bilirubin = 2.3 mg/dL. - The SOFA Liver score is based on the bilirubin level: - < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2-1.7: Score = 1 - 1.7-2.6: Score = 2 - 2.6-3.4: Score = 3 - > 3.4: Score = 4 - Since the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.7-2.6. - Therefore, the Liver score is 2. 4. **Cardiovascular:** - The score is based on the use of vasopressors and mean arterial pressure (MAP). - Given: The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. - To determine the cardiovascular score, we need to assess the vasopressor requirement. - The SOFA Cardiovascular score is based on the vasopressor use and MAP: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg: Score = 0 - No vasopressors and MAP < 70 mm Hg or any dose of dopamine or dobutamine: Score = 1 - Dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min or any dose of dobutamine + dopamine or noradrenaline/epinephrine ≤ 0.1 mcg/kg/min: Score = 2 - Noradrenaline or adrenaline > 0.1 mcg/kg/min: Score = 3 or 4 depending on the dose. - Let's break this down step-by-step: - The patient is on norEPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), EPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), DOPamine (7 mcg/kg/min), and DOBUTamine (1 mcg/kg/min). - Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at doses of 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, we need to consider the total vasopressor load. - According to the SOFA scoring system: - If the patient is on noradrenaline or adrenaline at a dose > 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 4. - If the patient is on noradrenaline or adrenaline at a dose between 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min, the score is 3. - If the patient is on noradrenaline or adrenaline at a dose between 0.5-1.0 mcg/kg/min, the score is 4. - If the patient is on dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min or any dose of dobutamine + dopamine or noradrenaline/epinephrine ≤ 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 2. - Here, the patient is using norEPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min) and EPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), both of which are types of vasopressors similar to noradrenaline and adrenaline. - The total dose of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine combined is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mcg/kg/min. - Since the total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine equivalents is 0.2 mcg/kg/min, which is > 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score for the cardiovascular system will be at least 3. - Since the dose is between 0.1 and 0.5 mcg/kg/min (0.2 mcg/kg/min), the score is 3. - Therefore, the Cardiovascular score is 3. 5. **Renal:** - The score is based on the creatinine level or urine output. - Given: Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL, and the urine output over the past 24 hours is 850 mL/day. - The SOFA Renal score is based on either creatinine or urine output: - Creatinine: - < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2-1.9: Score = 1 - 2.0-3.4: Score = 2 - 3.5-4.9: Score = 3 - ≥ 5.0: Score = 4 - Since the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2-1.9. - Therefore, the score based on creatinine is 1. - Urine output: - > 2000 mL/day: Score = 0 - 1000-2000 mL/day: Score = 1 - 500-1000 mL/day: Score = 2 - 0-500 mL/day: Score = 3 or 4 depending on the use of renal replacement therapy. - Given the urine output is 850 mL/day, it falls into the range 500-1000 mL/day. - Therefore, the score based on urine output is 2. - We take the higher of the two scores (creatinine and urine output). - The score based on creatinine is 1, and the score based on urine output is 2. - Therefore, the Renal score is 2 (the higher score). 6. **CNS (Central Nervous System):** - The score is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). - Given: GCS = 10. - The SOFA CNS score is based on the GCS: - GCS 15: Score = 0 - GCS 13-14: Score = 1 - GCS 10-12: Score = 2 - GCS 6-9: Score = 3 - GCS < 6: Score = 4 - Since the GCS is 10, it falls into the range 10-12. - Therefore, the CNS score is 2. Now, let's sum up all the scores from each system: - Respiratory: 3 - Coagulation: 0 - Liver: 2 - Cardiovascular: 3 - Renal: 2 - CNS: 2 Adding these scores together: \[ 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12. \] Therefore, the total SOFA score is 12. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate each of the six components: Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and CNS.\n\n1. **Respiratory:** - Given: FiO₂ = 54%, PaO₂ = 76 mm Hg. - Calculate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: \(\frac{76}{0.54} \approx 140.74.\) - The PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of 140.74 falls into the range 100-200, so the Respiratory score is 3.\n 2. **Coagulation:** - Given: Platelet count = 175,000/µL. - Since the platelet count is > 150,000, the Coagulation score is 0.\n 3. **Liver:** - Given: Bilirubin = 2.3 mg/dL. - The bilirubin level of 2.3 mg/dL falls into the range 1.7-2.6, so the Liver score is 2.\n 4. **Cardiovascular:** - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), EPINEPHrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), DOPamine (7 mcg/kg/min), and DOBUTamine (1 mcg/kg/min). - The total dose of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mcg/kg/min. - Since the total dose of noradrenaline/epinephrine equivalents is 0.2 mcg/kg/min (which is > 0.1 mcg/kg/min), the Cardiovascular score is 3.\n 5. **Renal:** - Given: Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL and urine output = 850 mL/day. - For creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL falls into the range 1.2-1.9, so the score is 1. - For urine output: 850 mL/day falls into the range 500-1000 mL/day, so the score is 2. - We take the higher score between creatinine and urine output, which is 2. Therefore, the Renal score is 2.\n 6. **CNS:** - Given: GCS = 10. - Since GCS 10 falls into the range 10-12, the CNS score is 2.\n Now, we add up all the scores: - Respiratory: 3 - Coagulation: 0 - Liver: 2 - Cardiovascular: 3 - Renal: 2 - CNS: 2 Total SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12.", "answer": "12"}

Step 1: Identify the parameters needed for the Child-Pugh Score. The Child-Pugh Score evaluates liver function based on the following parameters: - Total Bilirubin - Serum Albumin - Prothrombin Time (INR) - Presence of Ascites - Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy The scoring system for each parameter is as follows: For Total Bilirubin: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3 mg/dL = 3 points For Serum Albumin: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - < 2.8 g/dL = 3 points For INR (Prothrombin Time): - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - > 2.3 = 3 points For Ascites: - None = 1 point - Controlled by diuretics = 2 points - Refractory = 3 points For Hepatic Encephalopathy: - None = 1 point - Controlled by medication = 2 points - Refractory = 3 points Now let's evaluate each parameter based on the given information: 1. **Total Bilirubin**: The patient's total bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if the total bilirubin is between 2-3 mg/dL, it scores 2 points. - Therefore, the score for Total Bilirubin = 2 points. 2. **Serum Albumin**: The patient's albumin is 3.2 g/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if the serum albumin is between 2.8-3.5 g/dL, it scores 2 points. - Therefore, the score for Serum Albumin = 2 points. 3. **INR**: The patient's INR is 1.9. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if the INR is between 1.7-2.3, it scores 2 points. - Therefore, the score for INR = 2 points. 4. **Ascites**: The note states "There was no evidence of ascites." - According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if there is no ascites, it scores 1 point. - Therefore, the score for Ascites = 1 point. 5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: The note mentions "slight mental slowness and mild asterixis." Asterixis can be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy. - However, the severity of hepatic encephalopathy is not explicitly stated. Since it is described as "slight mental slowness and mild asterixis," it suggests that the hepatic encephalopathy is likely controlled or mild. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if hepatic encephalopathy is controlled by medication or is present but not refractory, it scores 2 points. If it is not present, it scores 1 point. - Given the description of "slight mental slowness and mild asterixis," it seems that the hepatic encephalopathy is present but not severe or refractory. It is likely controlled by the patient's current condition or lifestyle. - Therefore, the score for Hepatic Encephalopathy = 2 points. Now, we sum up the scores for each parameter: - Total Bilirubin: 2 points - Serum Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Hepatic Encephalopathy: 2 points Adding these together: 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) + 1 (Ascites) + 2 (Hepatic Encephalopathy) = 9 points. The Child-Pugh Score is 9. Therefore, the Child-Pugh Score is 9, which corresponds to Child-Pugh Class B (since Child-Pugh scores range from 5 to 15, with 5-6 being Class A, 7-9 being Class B, and 10-15 being Class C). So the final answer is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: Total Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, INR, Ascites, and Hepatic Encephalopathy. Here's the breakdown based on the given information:\n\n1. Total Bilirubin: 2.0 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh criteria, a total bilirubin between 2-3 mg/dL scores 2 points. Therefore, the score for Total Bilirubin is 2 points.\n\n2. Serum Albumin: 3.2 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh criteria, a serum albumin between 2.8-3.5 g/dL scores 2 points. Therefore, the score for Serum Albumin is 2 points.\n\n3. INR: 1.9. According to the Child-Pugh criteria, an INR between 1.7-2.3 scores 2 points. Therefore, the score for INR is 2 points.\n\n4. Ascites: The note states \"There was no evidence of ascites.\" According to the Child-Pugh criteria, no ascites scores 1 point. Therefore, the score for Ascites is 1 point.\n\n5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The note mentions \"slight mental slowness and mild asterixis,\" which suggests the presence of mild hepatic encephalopathy. According to the Child-Pugh criteria, if hepatic encephalopathy is controlled by medication or is present but not refractory, it scores 2 points. Therefore, the score for Hepatic Encephalopathy is 2 points.\n\nNow, we add up the scores: 2 (Total Bilirubin) + 2 (Serum Albumin) + 2 (INR) + 1 (Ascites) + 2 (Hepatic Encephalopathy) = 9 points.\n\nThus, the Child-Pugh Score is 9.", "answer": "9"}

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

Given the patient's height is 172 cm and weight is 100 kg, we can plug these values into the formula. Let's calculate it step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the height and weight into the required units. The height is already in centimeters (172 cm), and the weight is already in kilograms (100 kg). Step 2: Use the formula for BSA: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times (100)^{0.425} \times (172)^{0.725} \] Now, let's calculate each part separately. Step 3: Calculate \( (100)^{0.425} \). \[ (100)^{0.425} \approx 6.454 \] Step 4: Calculate \( (172)^{0.725} \). \[ (172)^{0.725} \approx 30.089 \] Step 5: Now multiply these results together along with the constant 0.007184. \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times 6.454 \times 30.089 \] First, multiply \( 6.454 \times 30.089 \): \[ 6.454 \times 30.089 \approx 194.33 \] Now multiply this result by 0.007184: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times 194.33 \approx 1.40 \] So the body surface area is approximately 1.94 m². It seems I made an error in the calculation. Let's use another common formula for calculating BSA, the DuBois formula: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times W^{0.425} \times H^{0.725}, \] where \( W \) is the weight in kilograms and \( H \) is the height in centimeters. Let's calculate it again step-by-step using the DuBois formula. Step 1: Calculate \( W^{0.425} \), where \( W = 100 \). \[ 100^{0.425} \approx 6.454 \] Step 2: Calculate \( H^{0.725} \), where \( H = 172 \). \[ 172^{0.725} \approx 30.089 \] Step 3: Now multiply these results by the constant 0.007184. \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times 6.454 \times 30.089 \] First, multiply \( 6.454 \times 30.089 \): \[ 6.454 \times 30.089 \approx 194.33 \] Now multiply this result by 0.007184: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times 194.33 \approx 1.40 \] So the BSA is approximately 1.94 m². It seems I made an error in the final multiplication. Let's do the multiplication step-by-step more carefully. \[ 6.454 \times 30.089 \approx 194.33 \] Now multiply this by 0.007184: \[ 194.33 \times 0.007184 \approx 1.40 \] Let's use another formula for BSA, the Mosteller formula, which is simpler and commonly used: \[ \text{BSA (m}^2) = \sqrt{\frac{\text{weight (kg)} \times \text{height (cm)}}{3600}}. \] Given the patient's weight = 100 kg and height = 172 cm, we can plug these values into the Mosteller formula. Step 1: Calculate the product of the weight and height. \[ \text{weight} \times \text{height} = 100 \times 172 = 17200. \] Step 2: Divide this product by 3600. \[ \frac{17200}{3600} \approx 4.7778. \] Step 3: Take the square root of the result. \[ \sqrt{4.7778} \approx 2.186. \] So the BSA is approximately 2.19 m². Thus, the body surface area is approximately 2.19 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the body surface area (BSA), I will use the Mosteller formula, which is given by: BSA (m²) = sqrt[(weight (kg) * height (cm)) / 3600]. The patient's weight is 100 kg and the height is 172 cm. First, I will calculate the product of the weight and height: 100 kg * 172 cm = 17200. Next, I will divide this product by 3600: 17200 / 3600 ≈ 4.7778. Finally, I will take the square root of this result: sqrt(4.7778) ≈ 2.186.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta.

Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta.

Clinical assessment 2. Tachycardia (>102) 3. Alternative explanation for the tachycardia 4. Alternative diagnosis </think> However, let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Review the patient's note and identify the relevant information for the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism. The Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism include the following factors: - Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) - Heart rate > 100 bpm - Immobility for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks - Previous DVT or PE - Hemoptysis - Malignancy (active or within 6 months) - Signs of DVT (unilateral leg swelling, increased calf circumference, localised tenderness, positive Homan's sign) From the patient note: - The patient is a 43-year old, asymptomatic woman. - She was admitted after a chest x-ray during routine clinical examination showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region. - A CT scan revealed a type B dissection originating from an aneurysm of the left cervical arch. - The patient had a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. - There is no mention of symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or any signs of DVT. - No information about recent surgery, immobility, previous DVT or PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, or signs of DVT is provided. Let's apply the Wells' criteria one by one: 1. **Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of DVT**: No mention of any symptoms or signs of DVT. 2. **Heart rate > 100 bpm**: The note states that the resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute. This criterion is not met. 3. **Immobilization for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks**: No information about recent surgery or prolonged immobilization is provided. This criterion is not met. 4. **Previous DVT or PE**: No information about a history of DVT or PE is provided. This criterion is not met. 5. **Hemoptysis**: No mention of hemoptysis. This criterion is not met. 6. **Malignancy (active or within 6 months)**: No information about malignancy is provided. This criterion is not met. 7. **Signs of DVT**: No signs of DVT (such as unilateral leg swelling, increased calf circumference, localized tenderness, positive Homan's sign) are mentioned. This criterion is not met. Since the patient is described as asymptomatic and there is no mention of any of the symptoms or risk factors associated with pulmonary embolism, it seems that none of the Wells' criteria are met. The Wells' criteria scoring system is as follows: - Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of DVT: 1.5 points - Heart rate > 100 bpm: 1.0 point - Immobility for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks: 1.0 point - Previous DVT or PE: 1.0 point - Hemoptysis: 1.0 point - Malignancy (active or within 6 months): 1.0 point - Signs of DVT: 0.5 point Since none of the criteria appear to be met based on the information provided in the patient note, the score would be 0. Therefore, the patient's score according to the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's score using the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, we need to evaluate the given patient note against each criterion. The patient is described as asymptomatic and was admitted due to a chest x-ray showing a mediastinal mass, which led to the discovery of a type B dissection. The key points from the note include:\n\n- The patient is asymptomatic.\n- The resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute.\n- No symptoms or signs of DVT or PE are mentioned.\n- No information about recent surgery, immobilization, previous DVT or PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, or signs of DVT is provided.\n\nApplying the Wells' criteria:\n\n1.

Total Bilirubin 2. Serum Albumin 3. Prothrombin Time (INR) 4. Presence of Ascites 5. Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy The scoring for each parameter is as follows: - **Total Bilirubin:** - <1 mg/dL: 1 point - 1-1.9 mg/dL: 2 points - 2-3 mg/dL: 3 points - >3 mg/dL: 4 points - **Serum Albumin:** - >3.5 g/dL: 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL: 2 points - 2.1-2.7 g/dL: 3 points - <2.1 g/dL: 4 points - **Prothrombin Time (INR):** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points - **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate: 3 points - Tense: 4 points - **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 2 points - Grade 2: 3 points - Grade 3-4: 4 points Now let's evaluate the patient's parameters one by one based on the information provided: 1. **Total Bilirubin:** The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria: - 2-3 mg/dL corresponds to 3 points. - Therefore, the score for Total Bilirubin is 3 points. 2. **Serum Albumin:** The patient's albumin level is 2.8 g/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria: - 2.8-3.5 g/dL corresponds to 2 points. - Therefore, the score for Serum Albumin is 2 points. 3. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** The patient's INR is 1.9. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria: - 1.7-2.3 corresponds to 2 points. - Therefore, the score for Prothrombin Time (INR) is 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** The patient has moderate ascites. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria: - Moderate ascites corresponds to 3 points. - Therefore, the score for Ascites is 3 points. 5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Since it's between grade 1 and 2, we'll take the higher score to be conservative, which is grade 2. - According to the Child-Pugh criteria: - Grade 2 corresponds to 3 points. - Therefore, the score for Hepatic Encephalopathy is 3 points. Now, let's add up all the scores: - Total Bilirubin: 3 points - Serum Albumin: 2 points - Prothrombin Time (INR): 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Hepatic Encephalopathy: 3 points Adding these together: 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13 points. To determine the Child-Pugh Class, we use the total score: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 13, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class C.

Let's use the Framingham Risk Score calculator formula for women. The Framingham Risk Score for women is calculated using the following factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. Given information: - Age = 67 years - Total cholesterol = 196 mg/dL - HDL cholesterol = 50 mg/dL - Systolic blood pressure = 140 mm Hg - Hypertension = Yes (she is taking lisinopril and metoprolol) - Smoking status = No (she does not smoke) - Diabetes = Not mentioned (we will assume no diabetes unless stated otherwise) Let's use the points system for the Framingham Risk Score for women. 1. **Age:** - For age 67: The points for age are 10. 2. **Total Cholesterol:** - Total cholesterol = 196 mg/dL - The points for total cholesterol are as follows: - 160-199 mg/dL: 3 points - Since 196 falls in the range 160-199 mg/dL, the points for total cholesterol = 3. 3. **HDL Cholesterol:** - HDL cholesterol = 50 mg/dL - The points for HDL cholesterol are as follows: - 50-59 mg/dL: -1 point - Since 50 falls in the range 50-59 mg/dL, the points for HDL cholesterol = -1. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure:** - Systolic blood pressure = 140 mm Hg - The points for systolic blood pressure are as follows: - 120-129 mm Hg: 0 points - 130-139 mm Hg: 1 point - 140-149 mm Hg: 2 points - 150-159 mm Hg: 3 points - 160-169 mm Hg: 4 points - 170-179 mm Hg: 5 points - 180 mm Hg or more: 6 points - Since 140 falls in the range 140-149 mm Hg, the points for systolic blood pressure = 2. 5. **Treatment for Hypertension:** - The patient is taking lisinopril and metoprolol, which indicates she is being treated for hypertension. - If treated for hypertension: +1 point. - Therefore, the points for treatment for hypertension = 1. 6. **Smoking Status:** - The patient does not smoke. - Non-smoker: 0 points. - Therefore, the points for smoking status = 0. Now, let's sum up all the points: - Age: 10 points - Total Cholesterol: 3 points - HDL Cholesterol: -1 point - Systolic Blood Pressure: 2 points - Treatment for Hypertension: 1 point - Smoking Status: 0 points Total points = 10 + 3 - 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15 points. To convert these points into a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease, we use the following table or formula. For women, the 10-year risk can be estimated from the total points. For a total score of 15 points: Using the Framingham Risk Score table for women: - 15 points corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 10-15%. However, the Framingham Risk Score is often presented in terms of points and can be converted to a percentage risk using a specific table or calculator. Let's use the points to percentage conversion for women: For a score of 15 points, the 10-year risk is approximately 10-15%. But if we need to give the score directly in points as per the task, the total points are 15. So the Framingham Risk Score is 15 points. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Framingham Risk Score for this 67-year-old woman, we use the following factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

The components of the HAS-BLED score are: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg) - A: Abnormal Renal/Liver function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (Time in therapeutic range < 60%) - E: Elderly (Age > 65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (Antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs or excessive alcohol intake) Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg)** - The patient's recent BP measurement is 164/113 mmHg. - Since the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 164 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is 113 mmHg, both exceed the thresholds (SBP > 160 mmHg and DBP > 100 mmHg). - Therefore, this criterion is met. - Score for H = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal/Liver function** - The note mentions that there are no predominant signs of renal impairment, as witnessed by normal creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate. - No information about liver function is provided, but since it's not mentioned that there are any abnormalities, we'll assume normal renal and liver function. - Therefore, this criterion is not met. - Score for A = 0. 3. **S: Stroke** - The patient has a history of stroke. - Therefore, this criterion is met. - Score for S = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes. - There is no mention of any bleeding tendency or predisposition. - Therefore, this criterion is not met. - Score for B = 0. 5. **L: Labile INR (Time in therapeutic range < 60%)** - The note mentions that the coagulation profiles including INR have consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. - Therefore, this criterion is not met. - Score for L = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (Age > 65 years)** - The patient is 70 years old. - Therefore, this criterion is met. - Score for E = 1. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (Antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs or excessive alcohol intake)** - The patient denies alcohol consumption, reporting zero drinks per week. - There is no information provided about the use of antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs. - Therefore, this criterion is not met unless we have information about the use of antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs. Since the information is not provided, we will assume that the patient is not taking these medications. - Score for D = 0. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - H = 1 - A = 0 - S = 1 - B = 0 - L = 0 - E = 1 - D = 0 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for the patient, we will evaluate each component of the score based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg)**\n - The patient's BP is 164/113 mmHg.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

Step 1: Calculate the anion gap (AG), which is given by the formula: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). But the albumin-corrected delta gap is actually a different calculation, which is HCO3 - (Na - Cl). Step 2: Calculate (Na - Cl). Na = 135 mmol/L Cl = 110 mmol/L So, Na - Cl = 135 - 110 = 25 mmol/L. Step 3: Now, we use the HCO3 value to calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap. HCO3 = 18 mmol/L The albumin-corrected delta gap is given by: Albumin-corrected delta gap = HCO3 - (Na - Cl) = 18 - 25 = -7 mmol/L. Thus, the albumin-corrected delta gap is -7 mEq/L (since 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L for these ions).

{'Row Number': 789, 'Calculator Name': 'Albumin Corrected Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '66', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8056694-1', 'Patient Note': 'A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '18', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' To calculate the albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is: Albumin corrected delta gap = HCO3 - (Na - Cl) ', 'LLM Explanation': 'Calculating albumin corrected delta gap using HCO3, Na, and Cl values', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '-7', 'Target Explanation': 'To calculate the albumin corrected delta gap, we use the formula: Albumin corrected delta gap = HCO3 - (Na - Cl).

Then we use the HCO3 value to find the albumin-corrected delta gap: HCO3 - (Na - Cl) = 18 - 25 = -7 mmol/L. Since 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L for these ions, the albumin-corrected delta gap is -7 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Step 1: Calculate the estimated date of ovulation. Since the cycle length is 27 days, ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of the cycle. Therefore, to find the day of ovulation from the LMP, we subtract the LMP and add approximately the cycle length minus the typical luteal phase length (which is about 14 days for most women). However, a common approach is to estimate conception around the time of ovulation, which is roughly midway through the cycle. For a 27-day cycle, ovulation would occur approximately 27 - 14 = 13 days after the start of the LMP. So, we need to add 13 or 14 days to the LMP to estimate the date of conception. Let's calculate it step by step. Step 1: Add 14 days to the LMP to estimate the date of conception. The LMP is 08/22/2014. Adding 14 days to 08/22/2014: - August has 31 days. - From 08/22/2014 to 08/31/2014 is 9 days. - So, 14 days from 08/22/2014 means we have already used up 9 days within August, and we need an additional 14 - 9 = 5 days into September. Therefore, 14 days after 08/22/2014 is 09/05/2014. Thus, the estimated date of conception is 09/05/2014. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. The LMP is 08/22/2014. 2. The cycle length is 27 days. 3. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of the cycle from the start of the LMP. For a 27-day cycle, ovulation occurs approximately 27 - 14 = 13 days after the LMP. 4. However, conception often occurs around the time of ovulation, which is typically around day 14 after the LMP for a regular cycle. Adding 14 days to the LMP (08/22/2014): - 08/22 + 9 days = 08/31 (end of August). - We still need 14 - 9 = 5 more days. - Therefore, 5 days into September gives us 09/05. Thus, the estimated date of conception is 09/05/2014. The final answer is 09/05/2014. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated date of conception, I use the rule that conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation, which is approximately 14 days after the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP).

To find the date of conception, I add 14 days to the LMP.\n\nStep 1: Start with the LMP, which is 08/22/2014.\nStep 2: Add 14 days to 08/22/2014.\n\nFrom 08/22/2014 to 08/31/2014 is 9 days (since 31 - 22 = 9).\nSo, after 9 days, we reach 08/31/2014.\nWe need a total of 14 days. Since we've already used 9 out of those 14 days, we have 14 - 9 = 5 more days left to add.\nAdding these 5 days to September gives us 09/05/2014.\nTherefore, the estimated date of conception is 09/05/2014.", "answer": "09/05/2014"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later. Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice. Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography). Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home. Here is the task: What is the patient's HEART score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the HEART score, the acronym stands for: H - Hypertension E - Electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia A - Age ≥ 65 R - Radial waveform or T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF T - Troponin elevation </think> However, it seems there might be some confusion because the HEART score is typically used for evaluating chest pain and risk stratification for acute coronary syndrome. It includes components such as History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Let's break this down step-by-step using the HEART score components: 1. **History (H):** This involves the characteristics of the chest pain. The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is not typical for cardiac chest pain but can be associated with pericarditis. Let's assign a score based on the type of chest pain. - Pleuritic chest pain: This is not typical for cardiac chest pain. Score = 0. 2. **Electrocardiogram (E):** The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. - No ST-segment changes or other ischemic changes: Score = 0. 3. **Age (A):** The patient is 47 years old. - Age < 65: Score = 0. 4. **Risk factors (R):** The risk factors for coronary artery disease include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease, etc. - The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These are both risk factors for coronary artery disease. - Presence of risk factors: Score = 1. 5. **Troponin (T):** The initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (which is elevated), but it subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml. - Elevated troponin initially but then normalized: We will consider the peak troponin level for this score. - Elevated troponin: Score = 1. Now let's sum up the scores for each component: - History (H) = 0 - Electrocardiogram (E) = 0 - Age (A) = 0 - Risk factors (R) = 1 - Troponin (T) = 1 Total HEART score = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2. The HEART score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher risk for acute coronary syndrome. A score of 2 suggests a relatively low risk for acute coronary syndrome. So the patient's HEART score is 2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score, we use the following components: History (H), Electrocardiogram (E), Age (A), Risk factors (R), and Troponin (T).

Since 2023 is not a leap year, it has 365 days. Therefore, the number of days from October 1, 2022, to October 1, 2023, is 365 days. Now, we need to calculate the number of days from October 1, 2022, to June 13, 2023. From October 1, 2022, to October 1, 2022: 0 days. Now, let's count the days month by month from October 1, 2022, to June 13, 2023. - October 2022: From October 1 to October 31 = 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days. - November 2022: 30 days. - December 2022: 31 days. - January 2023: 31 days. - February 2023: 28 days (since 2023 is not a leap year). - March 2023: 31 days. - April 2023: 30 days. - May 2023: 31 days. - June 2023: From June 1 to June 13 = 13 days. Now, let's add up these days: - October 2022: 31 days - November 2022: 30 days - December 2022: 31 days - January 2023: 31 days - February 2023: 28 days - March 2023: 31 days - April 2023: 30 days - May 2023: 31 days - June 2023 (up to June 13): 13 days Adding these together: \[ 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 13 (June) \] Let's do the math step by step: \[ 31 + 30 = 61 \] \[ 61 + 31 = 92 \] \[ 92 + 31 = 123 \] \[ 123 + 28 = 151 \] \[ 151 + 31 = 182 \] \[ 182 + 30 = 212 \] \[ 212 + 31 = 243 \] \[ 243 + 13 = 256 \] So, the total number of days between October 1, 2022, and June 13, 2023, is 256 days. To convert 256 days into weeks and days, we divide 256 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). \[ 256 \div 7 = 36.5714 \] This means there are 36 full weeks in 256 days. To find the number of remaining days, we calculate: \[ 256 - (36 \times 7) = 256 - 252 = 4 \] So, 256 days is equal to 36 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, the estimated gestational age is (36 weeks, 4 days). The final answer is (36 weeks, 4 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated gestational age, I first determined the number of days between the last menstrual period (10/01/2022) and today's date (06/13/2023).
