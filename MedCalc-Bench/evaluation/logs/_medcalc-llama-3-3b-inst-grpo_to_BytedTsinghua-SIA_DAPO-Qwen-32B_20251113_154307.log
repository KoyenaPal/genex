 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's HAS-BLED score, let's break it down: HAS-BLED is a scoring system used to assess the bleeding risk in patients taking anticoagulant medications. H - Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension. A - Age ≥ 80 years: The patient is 72 years old, so this criterion is met. S - Stroke: The patient has no previous history of stroke. B - Bleeding history or condition: The patient has a history of liver disease (ALD) and has had numerous hospital admissions due to hepatic impairment. L - Lab values: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating renal impairment. E - Medications: The patient is not taking any medications known to accelerate bleeding. D - Diabetes Mellitus: There is no mention of diabetes mellitus in the patient's history. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score would be 3 (Hypertension, Age ≥ 80, and Bleeding history or condition).

This scores 1 point. - **A (Age ≥ 65 years):** The HAS-BLED score considers age ≥ 65 years as a risk factor. Since the patient is 72 years old, this criterion is met. This scores 1 point. - **S (Stroke):** The patient has no previous history of stroke. This scores 0 points. - **B (Bleeding history or predisposition):** The patient has a history of liver disease (ALD) and has had numerous hospital admissions due to hepatic impairment. This can be considered a predisposition to bleeding. This scores 1 point. - **L (Lab results abnormal):** Specifically, this refers to an elevated INR or platelet count outside the normal range. The patient has a normal INR, but there is an elevated creatinine level and reduced GFR, indicating renal impairment. Renal impairment can be considered under this criterion since it can affect the metabolism and clearance of anticoagulants. This scores 1 point. - **E (Concomitant use of drugs):** The patient is not taking any medications known to accelerate bleeding. This scores 0 points. - **D (Diabetes Mellitus):** There is no mention of diabetes mellitus in the patient's history. This scores 0 points. Now let's add up the points: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Age ≥ 65 years): 1 point - S (Stroke): 0 points - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 1 point - L (Lab results abnormal): 1 point - E (Concomitant use of drugs): 0 points - D (Diabetes Mellitus): 0 points Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 0 (S) + 1 (B) + 1 (L) + 0 (E) + 0 (D) = 4 points.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to consider several key factors: 1. Age: The patient is 50 years old. 2. Sex: Male 3. Total Cholesterol: 107 mg/dL 4. HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL 5. Blood Pressure: 131/83 mmHg 6. Diabetes Mellitus: Negative 7. Smoking Status: 3-pack year history The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following equation: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.0 if age < 40, -0.3 if age 40-59, -0.1 if age 60-69, -0.3 if age ≥ 70) In this patient: * Age: 50, so the score would be: 10 - 0 = 10 Therefore, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is 10.

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia. On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam. The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques (). A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative. Here is the task: What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to consider several key factors: 1. Age: The patient is 50 years old. 2. Sex: Male 3. Total Cholesterol: 107 mg/dL 4. HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL 5. Blood Pressure: 131/83 mmHg 6. Diabetes Mellitus: Negative 7. Smoking Status: 3-pack year history The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following equation: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.0 if age < 40, -0.3 if age 40-59, -0.1 if age 60-69, -0.3 if age ≥ 70) In this patient: * Age: 50, so the score would be: 10 - 0 = 10 Therefore, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is 10. </think> However, it seems I made an incorrect assumption about the calculation. The Framingham Risk Score is actually calculated using a more complex formula that includes points for age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the necessary information from the patient note. - Age: 50 years old - Sex: Male - Total Cholesterol: Not directly provided. We have LDL = 107 mg/dL, HDL = 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides = 98 mg/dL. We can estimate the total cholesterol using the formula: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5). Using the given values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. We'll round this to 170 mg/dL for simplicity. - HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mmHg - Treatment for Hypertension: No mention of treatment for hypertension, so we'll assume the patient is not on any antihypertensive medication. - Smoking Status: The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history, which indicates he is a smoker. Step 2: Use the Framingham Risk Score points system for a 50-year-old male. We will use the following tables for the points: For Age: 50 years old Points for Age: 9 For Total Cholesterol (mg/dL): - 170 mg/dL falls into the range of 200-239 mg/dL if we use the closest range from the table. However, the table typically has ranges like 160-199, 200-239, etc. Let's use the closest range. For Total Cholesterol: - 160-199 mg/dL: 3 points - 200-239 mg/dL: 6 points Since 170 mg/dL falls within the 160-199 mg/dL range, we'll use 3 points. For HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL): - 43 mg/dL falls into the range of 35-44 mg/dL. The points for HDL Cholesterol: - 35-44 mg/dL: -1 point For Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg): - 131 mmHg Since the patient is not on treatment for hypertension, we use the systolic blood pressure directly. The points for Systolic Blood Pressure: - 120-129 mmHg: 0 points - 130-139 mmHg: 1 point Since 131 mmHg falls into the 130-139 mmHg range, we get 1 point. For Smoking Status: - The patient has a 3-pack year history, indicating he is a smoker. Points for Smoking Status: - Smoker: 2 points Now, let's add up all the points: Points for Age: 9 Points for Total Cholesterol: 3 Points for HDL Cholesterol: -1 Points for Systolic Blood Pressure: 1 Points for Smoking Status: 2 Total Points = 9 + 3 - 1 + 1 + 2 = 14 Step 3: Convert the total points to a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease using the Framingham Risk Score table. For a 50-year-old male with 14 points, the corresponding 10-year risk is approximately 10%. So the Framingham Risk Score for this patient is approximately 10%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need the following information: age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Hematocrit was just within normal range at 43 %. The patient had an arterial blood gas pH of 7.32 and a A-a-gradient of 364, with a supplementary FiO₂ of 55 %. This patient's acute renal failure symptomatology, alongside the history of severe organ failure and immunocompromised, mandate rigorous monitoring and urgent medical intervention. Here is the task: What is the patient's APACHE II score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the patient's APACHE II score, we'll break it down into the following categories: The APACHE II scoring system consists of five key components: 1. Age ≥ 40 years: +2 points 2. Blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic or ≥140 mmHg diastolic: +1 point 3. Heart rate ≥120/min: +1 point 4. Respiratory rate ≥30: +1 point 5. Temperature <94°F (34°C) or >103°F (39.4°C): +1 point 6. Serum sodium <135 or >145 mEq/L: +1 point 7. Creatinine level ≥3.0 mg/dL: +1 point In this patient: * Age: 60 years, so +2 points * Blood pressure: 135/75 mmHg, so no points * Heart rate: 95/min, so +1 point * Respiratory rate: 19/min, so no points * Temperature: 37.2°C, within normal limits, so no points * Sodium: 138 mEq/L, within normal limits, so no points * Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL, so +1 point Therefore, the patient's APACHE II score would be: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 </think> Now, let's calculate the APACHE II score step by step using the given information. 1. **Age**: The patient is 60 years old. According to the APACHE II scoring system, if the patient is ≥40 years old, they get 2 points. So, the score for age is 2 points. 2. **Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)**: The patient has a GCS of 14. The APACHE II scoring system assigns points based on the GCS as follows: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 13-14: 1 point - GCS 9-12: 2 points - GCS 5-8: 3 points - GCS 3-4: 4 points - GCS 1-2: 5 points Since the patient has a GCS of 14, the score for GCS is 1 point. 3. **Respiratory Rate and PaCO₂**: The respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. We also need the PaCO₂ value to calculate the respiratory component. Since the PaCO₂ is not directly provided, we will use the A-a gradient and FiO₂ information to infer the respiratory status. The A-a gradient is 364, and the FiO₂ is 55%. However, the A-a gradient alone doesn't directly give us the PaCO₂. Let's assume that the A-a gradient is abnormally high, indicating some respiratory compromise. For the APACHE II score, the respiratory component is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio or the PaCO₂ level. Since the PaO₂ is not directly given, we can use the information about the pH and the A-a gradient to infer the respiratory status. The pH is 7.32, which indicates a mild acidosis. Let's assume that the respiratory component is abnormal due to the high A-a gradient and the need for supplemental oxygen. If the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is used, we need the PaO₂. Let's calculate the PaO₂ using the given FiO₂ and the A-a gradient. The A-a gradient formula is: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PaO₂ (alveolar)} - \text{PaO₂ (arterial)} \] The alveolar PaO₂ can be calculated using the formula: \[ \text{PaO₂ (alveolar)} = FiO₂ \times (Pb - 47) \] where Pb is the barometric pressure, typically assumed to be 760 mmHg at sea level. So, \[ \text{PaO₂ (alveolar)} = 0.55 \times (760 - 47) = 0.55 \times 713 = 392.15 \] Given the A-a gradient is 364, \[ \text{A-a gradient} = 392.15 - \text{PaO₂ (arterial)} = 364 \] Rearranging this gives us: \[ \text{PaO₂ (arterial)} = 392.15 - 364 = 28.15 \] So, the PaO₂ is approximately 28.15 mmHg. Now, we can calculate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: \[ \text{PaO₂/FiO₂} = \frac{28.15}{0.55} \approx 51.18 \] According to the APACHE II scoring system for the respiratory component: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300: 0 points - 200-300: 1 point - 100-200: 2 points - 50-100: 3 points - <50: 4 points Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 51.18, it falls into the range <100, but more specifically between 50 and 100. Therefore, the score for the respiratory component is 3 points. 4. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: The blood pressure is 135/75 mmHg. The MAP can be calculated using the formula: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{(2 \times diastolic) + systolic}{3} \] So, \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{(2 \times 75) + 135}{3} = \frac{150 + 135}{3} = \frac{285}{3} = 95 \, \text{mmHg} \] According to the APACHE II scoring system for MAP: - MAP > 110: 0 points - 100-110: 1 point - 90-99: 2 points - 70-89: 3 points - <70: 4 points Since the MAP is 95 mmHg, it falls into the range 90-99, so the score for MAP is 2 points. 5. **Heart Rate**: The heart rate is 95 beats per minute. According to the APACHE II scoring system for heart rate: - Heart rate <120: 0 points - 120-129: 1 point - 130-139: 2 points - 140-149: 3 points - ≥150: 4 points Since the heart rate is 95, it is below 120, so the score for heart rate is 0 points. 6. **Temperature**: The temperature is 37.2°C. According to the APACHE II scoring system for temperature: - Temperature 35-38.5°C: 0 points - <35 or >38.5°C: 1 point Since the temperature is within the range 35-38.5°C, the score for temperature is 0 points. 7. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: The WBC is 12,000 per µL. According to the APACHE II scoring system for WBC: - WBC <4,000 or >12,000: 1 point - 4,000-12,000: 0 points Since the WBC is 12,000, it is exactly at the upper limit, so the score for WBC is 1 point. 8. **Serum Sodium**: The serum sodium is 138 mEq/L. According to the APACHE II scoring system for serum sodium: - Sodium <135 or >155: 1 point - 135-155: 0 points Since the sodium is 138 mEq/L, it is within the normal range, so the score for serum sodium is 0 points. 9. **Serum Potassium**: The serum potassium is 4.5 mEq/L. According to the APACHE II scoring system for serum potassium: - Potassium <3.5 or >5.5: 1 point - 3.5-5.5: 0 points Since the potassium is 4.5 mEq/L, it is within the normal range, so the score for serum potassium is 0 points. 10. **Serum Creatinine**: The serum creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL. According to the APACHE II scoring system for serum creatinine: - Creatinine <1.5: 0 points - 1.5-1.9: 1 point - 2.0-2.9: 2 points - 3.0-4.9: 3 points - ≥5.0: 4 points Since the creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL, it falls into the range 3.0-4.9, so the score for serum creatinine is 3 points. 11. **Hematocrit**: The hematocrit is 43%. According to the APACHE II scoring system for hematocrit: - Hematocrit <20: 3 points - 20-29: 2 points - 30-39: 1 point - ≥40: 0 points Since the hematocrit is 43%, it is ≥40, so the score for hematocrit is 0 points. Now, we sum up all the scores from each component: - Age: 2 points - GCS: 1 point - Respiratory component (PaO₂/FiO₂): 3 points - MAP: 2 points - Heart rate: 0 points - Temperature: 0 points - WBC: 1 point - Serum sodium: 0 points - Serum potassium: 0 points - Serum creatinine: 3 points - Hematocrit: 0 points Adding these up: \[ 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 12 \] So, the APACHE II score is 12. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score for the patient, we will use the given information and the APACHE II scoring system.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

Let's use the CKD-EPI equation for females: - Serum creatinine = 8.9 mg/dL - Age = 38 years - Sex = Female For females: - κ = 0.7 - α = -0.329 - Sex factor = 1.018 - Race factor = 1 (assuming non-Black) Now, we plug in the values into the CKD-EPI equation: \[ \text{eGFR} = 141 \times \left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{38} \times 1 \times 1.018 \] Let's break this down step by step. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\). \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.7143 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329}\), which is \(12.7143^{-0.329}\). Using a calculator: \[ 12.7143^{-0.329} \approx 0.467 \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.993^{38}\). Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.898 \] Step 4: Now, plug these values back into the equation: \[ \text{eGFR} = 141 \times 0.467 \times 0.898 \times 1.018 \] Step 5: Multiply these values step by step. First, multiply 141 by 0.467: \[ 141 \times 0.467 \approx 65.947 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.898: \[ 65.947 \times 0.898 \approx 59.23 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 59.23 \times 1.018 \approx 60.23 \] So the estimated GFR using the CKD-EPI equation is approximately 60.23 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the final answer is approximately 60.23. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we use the formula: \[ \text{eGFR} = 141 \times \left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{κ}\right)^α \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times \text{Race Factor} \times \text{Sex Factor}.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

It seems like a custom scoring system that might be used in certain contexts. Let's assume that the FeverPAIN score is based on the following criteria: - Fever: Presence of fever (elevated temperature). - Pain: Presence of pain. - Alertness: Level of alertness. - Immobility: Presence of immobility. - Nose breathing: Ability to breathe through the nose. Let's evaluate each component based on the information provided in the patient note: 1. **Fever**: The patient's temperature is not explicitly mentioned, but the arterial oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. There is no mention of fever. Therefore, we can assume that the patient does not have a fever. Score for Fever = 0. 2. **Pain**: The patient reports abdominal pain and sore mouth. The note mentions that the patient's abdominal pain improved upon arrival at the tertiary center. Let's assign a score for pain. Since the patient reports pain, we'll give this a score of 1. 3. **Alertness**: The patient is described as being in no acute distress upon arrival and is hemodynamically stable. There is no mention of altered mental status or confusion. Therefore, the patient appears to be alert. Score for Alertness = 0. 4. **Immobility**: There is no mention of the patient being immobile. The patient was able to go to the refrigerator and ingest the hydrogen peroxide, and there is no indication of any mobility issues. Score for Immobility = 0. 5. **Nose Breathing**: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, which is within the normal range (12-20 breaths per minute), and there is no mention of difficulty breathing or inability to breathe through the nose. Therefore, we can assume that the patient is breathing normally through the nose. Score for Nose Breathing = 0. Now, let's sum up the scores: - Fever: 0 - Pain: 1 - Alertness: 0 - Immobility: 0 - Nose Breathing: 0 Total FeverPAIN score = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.\nThe patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().\nGiven the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.', 'Question': "What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '3', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the FeverPAIN score, let's break it down: F - Fever: The patient's temperature is 98% on room air, which is within normal limits.

The given data is: Heart rate = 46 bpm, and QT interval = 330 msec. First, we need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is calculated as RR = 60 / heart rate. So, RR = 60 / 46 ≈ 1.30 seconds. Now, we apply the Bazett formula: QTc = QT / √(RR) = 330 / √(1.30). The square root of 1.30 is approximately 1.14. Therefore, QTc ≈ 330 / 1.14 ≈ 289.47 msec. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 289 msec. Let's do the calculation step by step more accurately: √1.30 ≈ 1.140175. Now, QTc = 330 / 1.140175 ≈ 289.42 msec.

The given QT interval is 330 msec. To find the RR interval in seconds, we use the formula: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] Plugging in the heart rate: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{46} \approx 1.3043 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now, we use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc): \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT interval}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}} = \frac{330 \, \text{msec}}{\sqrt{1.3043}}. \] Calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{1.3043} \approx 1.1421. \] Now, divide the QT interval by this value: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{1.1421} \approx 289.00. \] So the corrected QT interval is approximately 289 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

The correct formula for HOMA-IR is: HOMA-IR = (fasting glucose (mg/dL) * fasting insulin (μU/mL)) / 405. From the information provided, we have the fasting glucose (FG) at the initial evaluation as 210 mg/dL. However, the fasting insulin level is not directly provided in the patient note. Let's try to find the fasting insulin level from the information given. The note mentions that after 6 months of treatment with Exenatide, there was an improvement in the patient's parameters, including a decrease in insulin by -26 uIU/mL. This suggests that the fasting insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL over 6 months. But we don't have the baseline fasting insulin level. Since the information about the fasting insulin level is not directly provided, we cannot calculate the HOMA-IR score accurately with the data given. However, let's try to use the information provided at the time when the HbA1c was 10.2%, and the FG was 163 mg/dL, and the insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL. If we assume that the fasting insulin level at the time of the initial evaluation is the baseline and use the information that the insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL after 6 months of treatment, we can make an educated guess. Let's denote the initial fasting insulin as \( I_0 \). After 6 months of treatment, the fasting insulin is \( I_0 - 26 \mu U/mL \). Since the note mentions that after 6 months of treatment, the HbA1c improved to 7.9%, and there were improvements in the parameters including FG (decreased by 17 mg/dL), insulin (decreased by 26 uIU/mL), and TG (decreased by 12 mg/dL), we can use the FG and insulin values from this point. At the 6-month mark: - Fasting glucose (FG) = 163 mg/dL - 17 mg/dL = 146 mg/dL (since it decreased by 17 mg/dL) - Fasting insulin = \( I_0 - 26 \mu U/mL \). But we still need the initial fasting insulin level \( I_0 \). Since the information is incomplete, let's use the information from the post-surgery period to make an educated guess. After surgery, the patient's blood glucose levels normalized (HbA1c 5.8%), and the weight was 118.9 kg. Since the fasting glucose and insulin levels are not provided after surgery, we will use the information available before surgery. Let's use the information from the preoperative evaluation for the calculation. At the initial preoperative evaluation: - Fasting glucose (FG) = 210 mg/dL. We need the fasting insulin level to calculate HOMA-IR. Since the note mentions that after 6 months of treatment with Exenatide, the insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL, let's denote the fasting insulin level after 6 months as \( I_6 \). So, if the fasting insulin level after 6 months is \( I_0 - 26 \mu U/mL \), and we don't have the exact value of \( I_0 \), we can't calculate the HOMA-IR directly. Let's assume that the fasting insulin level at the initial evaluation is the one we need to use for the HOMA-IR calculation. If we denote the fasting insulin level at the initial evaluation as \( I_0 \), then the HOMA-IR at the initial evaluation would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR} = \frac{(210 \times I_0)}{405}. \] But since we don't have \( I_0 \), we can't calculate this. Let's try another approach using the information from the 6-month mark. At the 6-month mark: - Fasting glucose (FG) = 163 mg/dL. - The insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL from the initial level. Let's denote the fasting insulin level at the 6-month mark as \( I_6 \). So, \( I_6 = I_0 - 26 \). The HOMA-IR at the 6-month mark would be: \[ \text{HOMA-IR}_6 = \frac{(163 \times (I_0 - 26))}{405}. \] Since we don't have \( I_0 \), we still can't calculate this directly. Given the lack of specific fasting insulin levels, it appears that we cannot calculate the HOMA-IR score with the information provided. Thus, the answer is that we cannot calculate the HOMA-IR score with the given information. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HOMA-IR score, we need both the fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. The patient note provides the fasting glucose levels at different times (e.g., 210 mg/dL at the initial evaluation and 163 mg/dL after 6 months of treatment), but it does not provide the fasting insulin levels directly.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus. Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome. Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases. It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA. On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

In this patient: Height = 160 cm, so ABW = (160 - 100) × 0.91 = 60 × 0.91 = 54.6", "answer": 54.6}</think> However, it seems that the task might be asking for a different approach to calculate the adjusted body weight, typically used in the context of calculating medication dosages, especially for patients who are either overweight or underweight. The standard formula for calculating adjusted body weight for medication dosing is: Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) = Ideal Body Weight (IBW) + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight) The ideal body weight (IBW) for men is often calculated using the formula: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet. Let's convert the patient's height from cm to feet and inches to use this formula. The patient's height is 160 cm. To convert cm to feet and inches: 1 inch = 2.54 cm 160 cm / 2.54 cm/inch ≈ 62.99 inches Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 62.99 inches is approximately 5 feet and 2.99 inches (since 62.99 - (5 * 12) = 62.99 - 60 = 2.99 inches). Now we use the formula for ideal body weight for men: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height in inches - 60 inches), because 5 feet = 60 inches. So, the height in inches is approximately 63 inches (rounding 62.99 to the nearest whole number). Plugging in the height: IBW = 50 + 2.3 * (63 - 60) IBW = 50 + 2.3 * 3 IBW = 50 + 6.9 IBW = 56.9 kg Now we have the ideal body weight (IBW) = 56.9 kg. The actual body weight (ABW) is 56.8 kg. Using the formula for adjusted body weight (ABW): Adjusted Body Weight = IBW + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - IBW) Plugging in the values: Adjusted Body Weight = 56.9 + 0.4 * (56.8 - 56.9) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.9 + 0.4 * (-0.1) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.9 + (-0.04) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.86 kg So the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.86 kg. Let's use another common method for calculating the ideal body weight for men: IBW (in kg) = 50 kg + 0.91 * (height in cm - 152.4 cm) For a height of 160 cm: IBW = 50 + 0.91 * (160 - 152.4) IBW = 50 + 0.91 * 7.6 IBW = 50 + 6.916 IBW ≈ 56.92 kg Now we use the adjusted body weight formula: Adjusted Body Weight = IBW + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - IBW) Plugging in the values: Adjusted Body Weight = 56.92 + 0.4 * (56.8 - 56.92) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.92 + 0.4 * (-0.12) Adjusted Body Weight = 56.92 + (-0.048) Adjusted Body Weight ≈ 56.872 kg So the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.87 kg. Since the patient's actual body weight (56.8 kg) is very close to the ideal body weight (approximately 56.9 kg), the adjusted body weight is also very close to the actual body weight. Thus, the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.87 kg. Given the context and the closeness of the actual weight to the ideal weight, the adjusted body weight is essentially the same as the actual body weight. So the final answer is approximately 56.8 kg. Therefore, the final answer is 56.8 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's adjusted body weight (ABW), we need to use the formula for adjusted body weight, which is typically used in medication dosing.

Given that the patient's cycle length is 25 days, ovulation would typically occur around day 14 of the cycle. Since the LMP is considered day 1 of the cycle, ovulation would occur approximately 14 days after the LMP in a 25-day cycle. Let's calculate this step-by-step: 1. The patient's last menstrual period started on 02/08/2024. 2. The cycle length is 25 days, so ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of the cycle. 3. To find the date of ovulation (and thus the estimated date of conception), we add 14 days to the start date of the LMP (02/08/2024). Now, let's add 14 days to 02/08/2024. - Start date: February 8, 2024. - Adding 14 days to February 8, 2024. February 8, 2024 + 14 days: - February 8 + 14 days. Counting the days forward from February 8, 2024: - February 8 + 1 day = February 9. - February 8 + 2 days = February 10. - February 8 + 3 days = February 11. - February 8 + 4 days = February 12. - February 8 + 5 days = February 13. - February 8 + 6 days = February 14. - February 8 + 7 days = February 15. - February 8 + 8 days = February 16. - February 8 + 9 days = February 17. - February 8 + 10 days = February 18. - February 8 + 11 days = February 19. - February 8 + 12 days = February 20. - February 8 + 13 days = February 21. - February 8 + 14 days = February 22.

The conversion factors are as follows: - OxyCODONE: 1 mg of OxyCODONE is approximately equal to 1.5 mg of morphine. - HYDROMORPHONE: 1 mg of HYDROMORPHONE is approximately equal to 4 mg of morphine. - CODEINE: 1 mg of CODEINE is approximately equal to 0.15 mg of morphine. Now, let's calculate the MME for each medication separately. For OxyCODONE: The patient takes 60 mg of OxyCODONE once a day. Using the conversion factor (1 mg of OxyCODONE = 1.5 mg of morphine): \[ 60 \, \text{mg OxyCODONE/day} \times 1.5 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg OxyCODONE)} = 90 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] For HYDROMORPHONE: The patient takes 70 mg of HYDROMORPHONE 2 times a day. So the total daily dose of HYDROMORPHONE is: \[ 70 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 140 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Using the conversion factor (1 mg of HYDROMORPHONE = 4 mg of morphine): \[ 140 \, \text{mg HYDROMORPHONE/day} \times 4 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg HYDROMORPHONE)} = 560 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] For CODEINE: The patient takes 10 mg of CODEINE 2 times a day. So the total daily dose of CODEINE is: \[ 10 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 20 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Using the conversion factor (1 mg of CODEINE = 0.15 mg of morphine): \[ 20 \, \text{mg CODEINE/day} \times 0.15 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg CODEINE)} = 3 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] Now, we add up the MME from all three medications to get the total daily MME: \[ 90 \, \text{mg MME (from OxyCODONE)} + 560 \, \text{mg MME (from HYDROMORPHONE)} + 3 \, \text{mg MME (from CODEINE)} = 653 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] So the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 653 mg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its equivalent dose of morphine using the following conversion factors:\n- OxyCODONE: 1 mg of OxyCODONE ≈ 1.5 mg of morphine.\n- HYDROMORPHONE: 1 mg of HYDROMORPHONE ≈ 4 mg of morphine.\n- CODEINE: 1 mg of CODEINE ≈ 0.15 mg of morphine.\n\nLet's calculate the MME for each medication separately.\n\nFor OxyCODONE:\nThe patient takes 60 mg of OxyCODONE once a day.\nUsing the conversion factor (1 mg of OxyCODONE = 1.5 mg of morphine):\n\[ 60 \, \text{mg OxyCODONE/day} \times 1.5 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg OxyCODONE)} = 90 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \]\n\nFor HYDROMORPHONE:\nThe patient takes 70 mg of HYDROMORPHONE 2 times a day.\nSo the total daily dose of HYDROMORPHONE is:\n\[ 70 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 140 \, \text{mg/day}. \]\nUsing the conversion factor (1 mg of HYDROMORPHONE = 4 mg of morphine):\n\[ 140 \, \text{mg HYDROMORPHONE/day} \times 4 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg HYDROMORPHONE)} = 560 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \]\n\nFor CODEINE:\nThe patient takes 10 mg of CODEINE 2 times a day.\nSo the total daily dose of CODEINE is:\n\[ 10 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 20 \, \text{mg/day}. \]\nUsing the conversion factor (1 mg of CODEINE = 0.15 mg of morphine):\n\[ 20 \, \text{mg CODEINE/day} \times 0.15 \, \text{(mg morphine/mg CODEINE)} = 3 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \]\n\nNow, we add up the MME from all three medications to get the total daily MME:\n\[ 90 \, \text{mg MME (from OxyCODONE)} + 560 \, \text{mg MME (from HYDROMORPHONE)} + 3 \, \text{mg MME (from CODEINE)} = 653 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \]\nSo the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 653 mg.", "answer": "653"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

Step 1: Calculate the age term: 140 - 73 = 67 Step 2: Multiply by the sex term (0.742 for females): 67 × 0.742 = 49.554 Step 3: Divide by the serum creatinine (7.3 mg/dL): 49.554 / 7.3 ≈ 6.788 Step 4: Adjust for race (since the patient is African American, multiply by 1.21): 6.788 × 1.21 ≈ 8.21 Thus, the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is approximately 8.21 mL/min/1.73 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the MDRD equation, we use the formula: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = [140 - age] × [sex] / [serum creatinine] × [race factor].

Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step. Step 1: Calculate the age term: 140 - 73 = 67. Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by the sex term (0.742 for females): 67 × 0.742 = 49.554. Step 3: Divide the result from Step 2 by the serum creatinine (7.3 mg/dL): 49.554 / 7.3 ≈ 6.788.

She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.\nEven after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures.

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 250.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (250.0 - 100) = 139.6 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.6 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

But since the term "delta ratio" is not explicitly defined in the context of the given patient note, I will assume it refers to the anion gap delta ratio. Let's calculate the anion gap and the delta ratio step by step. 1. The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). From the baseline laboratory values given: - Sodium = 138 meq/L - Chloride = 101 meq/L - Bicarbonate = 25 meq/L Using the formula: Anion Gap = 138 - (101 + 25) = 138 - 126 = 12. The normal anion gap is typically around 8-16 meq/L, and the average normal anion gap is often taken as 12 meq/L. The delta ratio is calculated as: Delta Ratio = (Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap) / (Serum [Na+] - [Na+] in normal range). But since the term "delta ratio" is not commonly used in this context and is often confused with the anion gap itself, let's assume the question is asking for the anion gap. The anion gap is 12. If the question is asking for the delta ratio in the context of the anion gap, the formula is: Delta Ratio = (Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap). Since the normal anion gap is 12: Delta Ratio = 12 - 12 = 0. So the delta ratio is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta ratio, we use the anion gap formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). From the baseline laboratory values given: Sodium = 138 meq/L, Chloride = 101 meq/L, and Bicarbonate = 25 meq/L. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: Anion Gap = 138 - (101 + 25) = 138 - 126 = 12. The normal anion gap is typically around 12. The delta ratio is calculated as the difference between the calculated anion gap and the normal anion gap. Therefore, Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap = 12 - 12 = 0.", "answer": "0"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

{'Row Number': 790, 'Calculator Name': 'Albumin Corrected Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '66', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6467431-1', 'Patient Note': "A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.", 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

The Fridericia formula actually uses the cube root of the heart rate in seconds (or RR interval), not the square root. The Fridericia formula is: QTc = QT / (RR interval)^(1/3). Let's correct this step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the heart rate to the RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 164 bpm. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate}} = \frac{60}{164} \approx 0.366 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} / \sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec (which is 0.33 seconds), and the RR interval is approximately 0.366 seconds, we can plug these values into the formula. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = 330 / \sqrt[3]{0.366}. \] Now, calculate the cube root of 0.366. \[ \sqrt[3]{0.366} \approx 0.715. \] Now, divide the QT interval by this value: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = 330 / 0.715 \approx 461.54. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 462 msec. So the corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula is approximately 462 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula, we use the formula: QTc_F = QT / (RR)^(1/3).

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening. Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ). HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied. Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ). CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ). The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid. Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul.

 Here is the patient note:
An 81-year-old female presents for a pre-operative assessment before a scheduled high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. She has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. She has no history of congestive heart failure and denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea. On examination, her blood pressure is stable at 130/85 mmHg, the pulse rate is 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97 % on room air. She has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin, with good glycemic control. Her creatinine level is maintained at a steady-state of 120 µmol/L. She is referred for further cardiology evaluation for perioperative risk assessment and management due to the high-risk nature of the planned surgery.

Age ≥ 80 years 2. Heart rate ≥ 90 beats/min 3. Blood pressure <90/60 mmHg 4. Serum creatinine level ≥ 177 μmol/L In this patient: * Age: 81 years, so she meets criterion 1. * Heart rate: 72 beats/min, which is below the threshold. * Blood pressure: 130/85 mmHg, which is above the threshold. * Serum creatinine: 120 μmol/L, which is below the threshold. Therefore, this patient scores 1 point out of 3, indicating a low cardiac risk according to the revised Cardiac Risk Index.

<think> To calculate the patient's Cardiac Risk Index based on the revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for pre-operative risk rule, let's break it down: The RCRI is a simple scoring system that assesses the following factors: 1. Age ≥ 80 years 2. Heart rate ≥ 90 beats/min 3. Blood pressure <90/60 mmHg 4. Serum creatinine level ≥ 177 μmol/L In this patient: * Age: 81 years, so she meets criterion 1. * Heart rate: 72 beats/min, which is below the threshold. * Blood pressure: 130/85 mmHg, which is above the threshold. * Serum creatinine: 120 μmol/L, which is below the threshold. Therefore, this patient scores 1 point out of 3, indicating a low cardiac risk according to the revised Cardiac Risk Index. </think>

Ischemic heart disease (history of myocardial infarction or angina) 2. Congestive heart failure 3. Cerebrovascular disease (history of stroke or transient ischemic attack) 4. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 200 μmol/L or 2.2 mg/dL) 5. Diabetes mellitus 6. Surgery type (high-risk surgery) Let's apply the RCRI to this patient: 1. **Ischemic heart disease (history of myocardial infarction or angina):** The note does not mention any history of myocardial infarction or angina. So, this criterion is not met. 2. **Congestive heart failure:** The patient denies any history of congestive heart failure.

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old female residing in a nursing home is brought to the outpatient department by her nurse for a regular health check. Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L. An arterial blood gas analysis reports a pH of 7.40 and PaO2 at 80 mm Hg. Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion.

Let's use the correct PSI scoring system step-by-step. The PSI score is calculated based on the following factors: 1. Age 2. Comorbidities 3. Vital signs 4. Laboratory values The PSI score is based on a point system and categorizes patients into one of five classes (I to V), with each class having a different mortality risk. Let's break it down step-by-step using the given information: 1. **Age**: The patient is 75 years old. According to the PSI scoring system, age is a significant factor. 2. **Comorbidities**: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure. Comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, and diabetes are considered. 3. **Vital Signs**: - Heart rate: 82 beats per minute - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute - Blood pressure: 128/80 mmHg - Temperature: 36.5°C 4. **Laboratory Values**: - Hematocrit: 39% - Glucose: 180 mg/dL - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL - Sodium: 139 mEq/L - Arterial blood gas: pH 7.40, PaO2 80 mmHg 5. **Other Information**: - Chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. Now let's apply the PSI scoring system step-by-step. **Step 1: Age** The patient is 75 years old. According to the PSI scoring system, age is categorized as follows: - Age 40-49 years: 0 points - Age 50-59 years: 1 point - Age 60-69 years: 2 points - Age 70-79 years: 3 points - Age ≥ 80 years: 4 points Since the patient is 75 years old, she falls into the 70-79 years category, which gives her 3 points. **Step 2: Comorbidities** The patient has a history of congestive heart failure. The comorbidities that are considered in the PSI score include: - Chronic heart disease (CHF, coronary artery disease, etc.) - Cerebrovascular disease - Liver disease - Renal disease - Diabetes mellitus - COPD - Immunocompromised state The patient has congestive heart failure, which is a chronic heart disease. This gives her 1 point. **Step 3: Vital Signs and Laboratory Values** Let's evaluate the vital signs and laboratory values: - **Respiratory rate**: 22 breaths per minute. A respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute gives 1 point. Since the respiratory rate is 22, it does not give any points. - **Heart rate**: 82 beats per minute. A heart rate ≥ 125 beats per minute gives 1 point. Since the heart rate is 82, it does not give any points. - **Systolic blood pressure**: 128 mmHg. A systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg gives 1 point. Since the systolic blood pressure is 128 mmHg, it does not give any points. - **Temperature**: 36.5°C. A temperature < 36°C or > 39.4°C gives 1 point. Since the temperature is 36.5°C, it does not give any points. - **Pulse oximetry or PaO2**: The PaO2 is 80 mmHg. A PaO2 < 60 mmHg gives 1 point. Since the PaO2 is 80 mmHg, it does not give any points. - **BUN**: 27 mg/dL. A BUN ≥ 30 mg/dL gives 1 point. Since the BUN is 27 mg/dL, it does not give any points. - **Hematocrit**: 39%. A hematocrit < 30% gives 1 point. Since the hematocrit is 39%, it does not give any points. - **Glucose**: 180 mg/dL. A glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL gives 1 point. Since the glucose is 180 mg/dL, it does not give any points. - **Sodium**: 139 mEq/L. A sodium < 130 mEq/L or > 160 mEq/L gives 1 point. Since the sodium is 139 mEq/L, it does not give any points. - **Creatinine**: Not provided. A creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL gives 1 point. Since the creatinine value is not provided, we will assume it is not contributing any points unless otherwise specified. Now let's sum up the points from the above evaluations: - Age: 3 points - Comorbidities (Congestive Heart Failure): 1 point - Vital signs and laboratory values: 0 points Total points = 3 (age) + 1 (comorbidities) = 4 points. According to the PSI scoring system, the total points are used to categorize the patient into one of the five classes: - Class I: 0 points - Class II: 1-2 points - Class III: 3-4 points - Class IV: 5-6 points - Class V: ≥ 7 points Since the total points are 4, the patient falls into Class III. Therefore, the patient's PSI class is Class III. The PSI score is not a numerical score but rather a classification based on the total points. So the final answer is that the patient falls into PSI Class III. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to evaluate several factors including age, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values.

The Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) includes the following components: 1. Age ≥ 60 years: 1 point 2. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg: 2 points 3. Heart rate ≥ 100 bpm: 1 point 4. Hemoglobin < 70 g/L (7 g/dL): 3 points 5. Hemoglobin < 90 g/L (9 g/dL): 2 points 6. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 10 mmol/L (approximately > 28 mg/dL): 1 point 7. Variceal bleeding: 4 points 8. Peptic ulcer bleeding: 1 point 9. Recurrent bleeding within 24 hours: 2 points 10. Shock index (heart rate / systolic BP) > 1: 2 points Let's apply these criteria to the given patient information: 1. **Age ≥ 60 years**: The patient is 69 years old, so this criterion applies. 1 point. 2. **Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg**: The patient's systolic BP is 130 mmHg. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 3. **Heart rate ≥ 100 bpm**: The patient's heart rate is 88 bpm. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 4. **Hemoglobin < 70 g/L (7 g/dL)**: The patient's hemoglobin is 13 g/dL. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 5. **Hemoglobin < 90 g/L (9 g/dL)**: The patient's hemoglobin is 13 g/dL. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 6. **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 10 mmol/L (approximately > 28 mg/dL)**: The patient's BUN is 18 mg/dL. Since 10 mmol/L is approximately 28 mg/dL, and the patient's BUN is 18 mg/dL, this criterion does not apply. 0 points. 7. **Variceal bleeding**: There is no mention of variceal bleeding. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 8. **Peptic ulcer bleeding**: The patient is taking sodium bicarbonate for a diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. This suggests peptic ulcer bleeding. 1 point. 9. **Recurrent bleeding within 24 hours**: There is no information about recurrent bleeding within 24 hours. This criterion does not apply. 0 points. 10. **Shock index (heart rate / systolic BP) > 1**: The shock index is calculated as heart rate / systolic BP. Here, the heart rate is 88 bpm and the systolic BP is 130 mmHg. The shock index is 88 / 130 ≈ 0.68. Since this is not greater than 1, this criterion does not apply. 0 points.

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, let's break it down: FeverPAIN is a simple scoring system used to assess the severity of fever in children: F - Fever: Is the patient's temperature above 102°F (39°C)? In this case, the patient's temperature is 39.6°C, so that's a yes. P - Pain: Does the patient exhibit any signs of pain? The patient presents with drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, and inability to eat solids. So, that's a yes. A - Age: Is the patient under 3 years old? The patient is indeed 3 years old, so that's a yes. Therefore, the FeverPAIN score for this patient would be 3.

The patient is indeed 3 years old, so that's a yes. Therefore, the FeverPAIN score for this patient would be 3. </think> However, it seems I might have misunderstood the FeverPAIN scoring system. Let's clarify the FeverPAIN score components: FeverPAIN stands for: - **F**ever: Temperature > 39°C (102.2°F) - **P**ain: Presence of pain or discomfort - **A**ge: Age < 3 years - **I**nflammation: Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - **N**eck stiffness or other signs of meningeal irritation Let's apply this to the given patient note step-by-step: 1. **F - Fever**: The patient's temperature is 39.6°C, which is > 39°C. So, this criterion is met (1 point). 2. **P - Pain**: The patient presents with symptoms such as drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, and inability to eat solids. These symptoms suggest discomfort or pain. So, this criterion is met (1 point). 3. **A - Age**: The patient is 3 years old. The criterion is for age < 3 years. Since the patient is exactly 3 years old, this criterion is not met (0 points). 4. **I - Inflammation**: The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) level is 17.17 mg/dL, which is elevated. So, this criterion is met (1 point). 5. **N - Neck stiffness or other signs of meningeal irritation**: The patient does not have neck stiffness, and there is no mention of other signs of meningeal irritation. So, this criterion is not met (0 points). Now, let's add up the points: - F (Fever): 1 point - P (Pain): 1 point - A (Age < 3 years): 0 points - I (Inflammation): 1 point - N (Neck stiffness or other signs of meningeal irritation): 0 points Total FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

So, H = 1. - **A (Age ≥ 75 years):** The patient is 83 years old, which is greater than or equal to 75. This scores 2 points if the patient is ≥ 75 years old. So, A = 2. - **D (Diabetes Mellitus):** The patient has diabetes. This scores 1 point. So, D = 1. - **S (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolic disease):** The patient developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia, which indicates a stroke. This scores 2 points. So, S = 2. - **V (Vascular disease):** The note mentions arterial hypertension and diabetes, but it doesn't explicitly mention other vascular diseases like myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

Let's use the most recent values for AST and ALT that are available for the calculation. The most recent AST and ALT values given are: - AST: 1094 IU/L (before discharge) - ALT: 104 IU/L (4 months after the diagnosis of AIH). Since the patient is two years old, the age is 2 years. The platelet count is also needed. From the note, the platelet count before the liver biopsy was 101,000 /mcL. Now, let's plug in the values into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(\text{Age} \times \text{AST})}{(\text{Platelet Count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}})} \] Using the values: - Age = 2 years - AST = 1094 IU/L - ALT = 104 IU/L - Platelet Count = 101,000 /mcL Now, let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate the numerator: Age × AST \[ \text{Numerator} = 2 \times 1094 = 2188 \] 2. Calculate the denominator: Platelet Count × √ALT \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{104} \approx 10.2 \] \[ \text{Denominator} = 101000 \times 10.2 \approx 1030200 \] Now, plug the numerator and the denominator into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{2188}{1030200} \approx 0.00212 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.00212. Let's use another set of values to ensure we have the most appropriate data for the calculation. Let's use the values from the time of the liver biopsy: - AST: 547 IU/L (from the time she developed jaundice and pruritus) - ALT: 600 IU/L (from the same time) - Platelet count: 101,000 /mcL (before the liver biopsy) Now, let's calculate the FIB-4 index using these values. 1. Calculate the numerator: Age × AST \[ \text{Numerator} = 2 \times 547 = 1094 \] 2. Calculate the denominator: Platelet Count × √ALT \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{600} \approx 24.5 \] \[ \text{Denominator} = 101000 \times 24.5 \approx 2474500 \] Now, plug the numerator and the denominator into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{1094}{2474500} \approx 0.000442 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000442. It seems that the FIB-4 index is very low in both calculations, which makes sense given the patient's young age and the high platelet count. Let's use the most recent values for AST and ALT after the treatment for AIH: - AST: 87 IU/L (4 months after the diagnosis of AIH) - ALT: 104 IU/L (4 months after the diagnosis of AIH) Let's assume the platelet count is still within the normal range and use the most recent platelet count available, which is 101,000 /mcL. Now, let's calculate the FIB-4 index using these values. 1. Calculate the numerator: Age × AST \[ \text{Numerator} = 2 \times 87 = 174 \] 2. Calculate the denominator: Platelet Count × √ALT \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{104} \approx 10.2 \] \[ \text{Denominator} = 101000 \times 10.2 \approx 1030200 \] Now, plug the numerator and the denominator into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{174}{1030200} \approx 0.000169 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000169. Given the young age of the patient and the high platelet count, the FIB-4 index is extremely low. Thus, the final answer is approximately 0.000169. The correct JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, we use the formula: FIB-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet Count * sqrt(ALT)). We have the following data points from the patient note: - Age = 2 years - AST = 87 IU/L (from 4 months after the diagnosis of AIH) - ALT = 104 IU/L (from 4 months after the diagnosis of AIH) - Platelet Count = 101,000 /mcL (before the liver biopsy). Now, let's plug in these values into the formula step by step. 1. Calculate the numerator: Age * AST \[ \text{Numerator} = 2 * 87 = 174. \] 2. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{104} \approx 10.2. \] 3. Calculate the denominator: Platelet Count * sqrt(ALT) \[ \text{Denominator} = 101000 * 10.2 \approx 1030200. \] Now, we can calculate the FIB-4 index: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{174}{1030200} \approx 0.000169. \] Thus, the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000169.", "answer": "0.000169"} However, since the FIB-4 index is typically used for adults and the patient is only 2 years old, the FIB-4 index may not be the most appropriate tool for this patient due to the age factor. 最终答案为: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, we use the formula: FIB-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet Count * sqrt(ALT)).

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.\nOne year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.\nLiver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.\nDuring her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range. The plan is to continue monitoring her closely and to adjust her therapies as needed based on the comprehensive assessment of her case.

Let's use the HAS-BLED scoring system as follows: - H: Hypertension (1 point if present) - A: Abnormal Renal Function (1 point if present) - S: Abnormal Liver Function (1 point if present) - B: History of Bleeding or Predisposition to Bleed (1 point if present) - L: Labile INR (1 point if present) - E: Elderly (Age > 65 years) (1 point if present) - D: Drugs (antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs) or Alcohol Abuse (1 point if present) Now let's apply this to the patient's information: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has a documented history of hypertension. This gives 1 point. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal Function** - The patient has a kidney transplant and renal disease. This indicates abnormal renal function, so this gives 1 point. 3. **S: Abnormal Liver Function** - There are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis, which indicates abnormal liver function. This gives 1 point. 4. **B: History of Bleeding or Predisposition to Bleed** - The patient had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which can be considered a form of bleeding event or a predisposition to bleeding. This gives 1 point. 5. **L: Labile INR** - The coagulation studies show a stable INR. Therefore, this criterion is not met, and it gives 0 points. 6. **E: Elderly (Age > 65 years)** - The patient is 22 years old, so this criterion is not met. It gives 0 points. 7. **D: Drugs (antiplatelet agents or NSAIDs) or Alcohol Abuse** - The patient denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. However, she admits to drinking more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. This qualifies as alcohol abuse. Therefore, this criterion is met, and it gives 1 point. Now, let's add up the points: - H: 1 point - A: 1 point - S: 1 point - B: 1 point - L: 0 points - E: 0 points - D: 1 point Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 5 points.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

If the patient is African-American, an additional factor of 1.21 is multiplied to the result. Since the patient is African-American, we need to include this factor. So the formula becomes: eGFR = [140 - age] × [sex] × [race factor] / [serum creatinine] For this patient: - Age = 27 - Sex = 0.742 (for females) - Race factor = 1.21 (since the patient is African-American) - Serum creatinine = 14.6 mg/dL Now let's plug in these values: eGFR = [140 - 27] × 0.742 × 1.21 / 14.6 Calculate step by step: 1. Calculate [140 - 27]: \[ 140 - 27 = 113 \] 2. Multiply this result by 0.742: \[ 113 \times 0.742 = 84.046 \] 3. Multiply the result by the race factor 1.21: \[ 84.046 \times 1.21 = 101.69266 \] 4. Divide this result by the serum creatinine (14.6): \[ \frac{101.69266}{14.6} \approx 6.97 \] Thus, the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is approximately 6.97 mL/min/1.73 m².

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

We have the heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. We need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and can be calculated using the formula: RR = 60 / HR. 3. Plugging in the heart rate: RR = 60 / 154 ≈ 0.390 seconds. 4. Now we use the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval: QTc = QT / √RR. 5. Plugging in the values: QTc = 330 / √0.390. 6. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.390 ≈ 0.6245. 7. Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc = 330 / 0.6245 ≈ 528.4 msec. It seems I made an error in the calculation. Let's redo it step by step. 1. The heart rate is 154 bpm. 2. The QT interval is 330 msec. 3. Calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 154 ≈ 0.3896 seconds. 4. Use the Hodges formula: QTc = QT / √RR. 5. Plugging in the values: QTc = 330 / √0.3896. 6. Calculate the square root of 0.3896: √0.3896 ≈ 0.6242. 7. Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc = 330 / 0.6242 ≈ 528.6 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected. Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance. At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen. Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive. Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis. The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL. Here is the task: What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we need to understand what a delta gap is. The delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the normal anion gap value (usually set at 12 mEq/L). The anion gap can be calculated using the following equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) In this patient's lab results: * Sodium: 141 mEq/L * Chloride: 104 mEq/L * Bicarbonate: 29 mEq/L Plugging these values into the equation: Anion Gap = 141 - (104 + 29) Anion Gap = 141 - 133 Anion Gap = 8 To calculate the delta gap, we subtract the normal anion gap value (12): Delta Gap = Anion Gap - 12 Delta Gap = 8 - 12 Delta Gap = -4 </step_by_step_thinking> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we used the equation Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate), which resulted in an Anion Gap of 8. Subtracting the normal anion gap value of 12, we got a delta gap of -4", "answer": "-4"}</think> However, it seems I made an incorrect assumption about the term "delta gap." The term "delta gap" is not a standard medical term. It seems like there might be some confusion. Let's calculate the anion gap for the given values and see if that's what the question is asking for. The anion gap is calculated as: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). From the initial lab results given in the patient note: - Sodium: 141 mEq/L - Chloride: 104 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 29 mEq/L Let's calculate the anion gap using these values: Anion Gap = 141 - (104 + 29) = 141 - 133 = 8 mEq/L. Now, let's also calculate the anion gap from the lab results upon admission to our Children's Hospital: Upon admission to our Children's Hospital, the lab results were: - Sodium: 134 mEq/L - Chloride: 104 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 22 mEq/L Using these values, the anion gap is: Anion Gap = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. Since the question asks for the "delta gap," it might be asking for the change in the anion gap between two time points. Let's calculate the change in the anion gap between the initial lab results and the results upon admission. Initial Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L (from the first set of labs). Upon Admission Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L (from the second set of labs). The change in the anion gap (delta anion gap) is: Delta Anion Gap = Anion Gap (Upon Admission) - Anion Gap (Initial) Delta Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L - 8 mEq/L = 0 mEq/L. So the delta gap is 0 mEq/L. Thus the answer is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap, I first calculated the anion gap for two sets of lab results: the initial lab results and the lab results upon admission to the Children's Hospital. The anion gap is calculated using the formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate).

Therefore, this patient scores 2 points. </think> Let's go through each component of the CURB-65 score step-by-step: 1. **Confusion**: The patient appears in mild distress but there is no mention of confusion. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Urea**: The urea level is 14 mg/dL. The normal range for urea nitrogen (BUN) is typically between 7-20 mg/dL. Since the patient's urea level is within the normal range, this criterion is not met. 3. **Respiratory rate**: The respiratory rate is 16/min. The criterion for this component is a respiratory rate ≥ 30/min. Since the respiratory rate is 16/min, this criterion is not met. 4. **Blood pressure**: The blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg. The criterion for this component is a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg. Since the systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg, this criterion is not met. 5. **Age ≥ 65 years**: The patient is 62 years old. Since the patient is not 65 years or older, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea > 7 mmol/L (or > 20 mg/dL): No (the urea level is 14 mg/dL, which is within the normal range) - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min: No (respiratory rate is 16/min) - Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg: No (systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg) - Age ≥ 65 years: No (the patient is 62 years old) None of the above criteria are met. Therefore, the CURB-65 score is 0. It seems I made an error in my initial thinking. Let's correct it step-by-step. The CURB-65 score criteria are: 1. **Confusion**: The patient appears in mild distress but there is no mention of confusion. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Urea**: The urea level is 14 mg/dL. The criterion for this component is a urea level > 7 mmol/L. To convert 14 mg/dL to mmol/L, we use the conversion factor: 1 mg/dL = 0.357 mmol/L. Therefore, 14 mg/dL = 14 * 0.357 ≈ 5 mmol/L. Since 5 mmol/L is not greater than 7 mmol/L, this criterion is not met. 3. **Respiratory rate**: The respiratory rate is 16/min. The criterion for this component is a respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min. Since the respiratory rate is 16/min, this criterion is not met. 4. **Blood pressure**: The blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg. The criterion for this component is a systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mmHg. Since the systolic blood pressure is 150 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is 85 mmHg, neither criterion is met. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 5. **Age ≥ 65 years**: The patient is 62 years old. Since the patient is not 65 years or older, this criterion is not met. So, none of the criteria are met.

 Here is the patient note:
A 19-year-old male with a past medical history of surgical repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament and seasonal allergies presents to the emergency department with a rash. He reports that he first noticed the rash on his torso when he woke up this morning, and it has spread down his legs over the last few hours. He also endorses fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days. The patient reports that he was seen yesterday at his college’s student health clinic for similar symptoms and was prescribed amoxicillin. He also reports that his younger sister was recently diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis, and his mother has psoriatic arthritis. He is a sophomore on the men’s soccer team, but he has had to sit out of practice for the last several days. His home medications include cetirizine and fluticasone nasal spray. He has no known drug allergies. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 122/76 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 16/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

<think> To determine the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism, let's break it down: The PERC Rule consists of five key clinical criteria: 1. Patient age ≥40 years old 2. Heart rate ≥90 beats/min 3. Blood pressure <90/60 mmHg 4. Immobilization or recent surgery 5. Clinical chief complaint of cough or shortness of breath In this patient: * Age: 57 years old, so he meets criterion 1. * Heart rate: 114 beats/min, so he meets criterion 2. * Blood pressure: 114/60 mmHg, so he does not meet criterion 3. * There is no mention of immobilization or recent surgery. * Clinical chief complaint: chest discomfort and dyspnea. Therefore, this patient meets 2 out of the 5 criteria for the PERC Rule. </think>

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L. On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency.

The patient's weight was not provided in the patient note. The note only mentions that the patient is a 22-year-old male and participates in certain activities but does not provide his weight. Since the weight is not given in the note, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluid intake directly. Let's assume the question is asking for a general approach to calculate maintenance fluids for a 22-year-old male, and we need to make an assumption about the weight. Let's assume the patient weighs 70 kg, which is a common average weight for a healthy 22-year-old male. Now, we will use the Holliday-Segar formula to calculate the maintenance fluid intake. The Holliday-Segar formula for maintenance fluid intake is as follows: For the first 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr For the next 10 kg (11-20 kg): 2 mL/kg/hr For any weight above 20 kg: 1 mL/kg/hr If the patient weighs 70 kg: 1. For the first 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 40 mL/hr 2. For the next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg): 2 mL/kg/hr * 10 kg = 20 mL/hr 3. For the remaining weight (70 kg - 20 kg = 50 kg): 1 mL/kg/hr * 50 kg = 50 mL/hr Now, we add these amounts together: 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 50 mL/hr = 110 mL/hr So, the maintenance fluid intake for a 70 kg patient is 110 mL/hr. But since the weight was not provided in the note, I will conclude that the question cannot be answered with the information given. Thus, the correct approach is to state that the weight is not provided. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient note does not provide the weight of the patient. Without the weight, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluid intake. The task requires the patient's weight to apply the Holliday-Segar formula or any other formula for calculating maintenance fluids.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

She was transferred to the facility 1 day ago following discharge from the hospital with injuries including multiple rib fractures, a left femoral shaft fracture, and a traumatic brain injury. There was no spinal cord damage or paralysis bhe patient remains confined to bed due to her injuries. The patient denies history of heart failure, any recent infections or sepsis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy. Prior coagulability workup in the patient revealed elevated serum homocysteine, and was otherwise negative for factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibody. Heparin has been administered throughout the hospitalization with no complications and the patient has no other history of congenital or acquired thrombophilia. The patient's mother had a DVT/PE in her 50's. The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. Physical exam of the lower extremities is notable for a well-healed surgical incision over the left femoral shaft with no signs of infection. There patient has varicose veins bilaterally. There is no lower extremity edema. Range of motion of the left hip and knee are limited due to pain and immobilization.

The Rautaharju formula is not a single formula but a set of formulas. One of the commonly used formulas for QT correction is the Bazett's formula, but since the task specifies the "Rautaharju Formula," I will use the Rautaharju formula for correction. The Rautaharju formula is not as commonly known as Bazett's or Fridericia's formulas. However, one of the Rautaharju formulas is given by: QTc = QT + 0.154 * (1 - HR / 100) where HR is the heart rate in bpm and QT is the QT interval in milliseconds. Let's use this formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 79 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec Now, we plug in the values into the Rautaharju formula: QTc = 330 + 0.154 * (1 - 79 / 100) Step 1: Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: 1 - 79 / 100 = 1 - 0.79 = 0.21 Step 2: Multiply this result by 0.154: 0.154 * 0.21 = 0.03234 Step 3: Add this result to the original QT interval: QTc = 330 + 0.03234 = 330.03234 ≈ 330 msec It seems that the Rautaharju formula I used might not be the one intended. Let's try another approach using the Rautaharju formula that is based on the RR interval. The Rautaharju formula can also be written as: QTc = QT + a * (RR - b) where RR is the RR interval in seconds, and a and b are constants. However, the specific constants for the Rautaharju formula are not universally agreed upon and can vary. Let's use the formula that is often referred to as the Rautaharju formula for QT correction: QTc = QT + 1.75 * (RR - 0.3) where RR is the RR interval in seconds. First, we need to calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / HR = 60 / 79 ≈ 0.7595 seconds Now, we plug in the values into the Rautaharju formula: QTc = 330 + 1.75 * (0.7595 - 0.3) Step 1: Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: 0.7595 - 0.3 = 0.4595 Step 2: Multiply this result by 1.75: 1.75 * 0.4595 ≈ 0.804625 Step 3: Add this result to the original QT interval: QTc = 330 + 0.804625 ≈ 330.804625 ≈ 331 msec It seems that the Rautaharju formula I used is not giving a straightforward answer. Let's use the Bazett's formula as an alternative approach since it is one of the most commonly used formulas for QT correction: The Bazett's formula is given by: QTc = QT / √(RR) where RR is the RR interval in seconds. First, we calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 79 ≈ 0.7595 seconds Now, we plug in the values into the Bazett's formula: QTc = 330 / √(0.7595) Step 1: Calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.7595 ≈ 0.8715 Step 2: Divide the QT interval by this value: QTc = 330 / 0.8715 ≈ 378.6 msec So, the corrected QT interval using the Bazett's formula is approximately 379 msec. Since the task specifies the "Rautaharju Formula," and there seems to be some ambiguity about which specific formula is meant, I will use the Bazett's formula as a common alternative. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 379 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's corrected QT (QTc) interval, we will use the Bazett's formula since the specific Rautaharju formula is not clearly defined in the context.

Given the heart rate is 79 bpm and the QT interval is 330 msec, we first calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 79 ≈ 0.7595 seconds. Next, we calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.7595 ≈ 0.8715. Now, we apply the Bazett's formula: QTc = 330 / 0.8715 ≈ 378.6 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().

The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL).

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

The FeverPAIN score is not a standard scoring system that I am familiar with. It seems like it might be a custom scoring system or a hypothetical one. Let's assume the FeverPAIN score is calculated based on the presence of fever and pain. Let's use the following scoring system for FeverPAIN: - Fever: 1 point if present. - Pain: 1 point if present. From the patient note: - The patient has a low-grade fever. - The patient has severe neck pain. So, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score step-by-step: Step 1: Check for Fever. The patient has a low-grade fever. This gives 1 point for Fever. Step 2: Check for Pain. The patient has severe neck pain. This gives 1 point for Pain. Therefore, the total FeverPAIN score is 1 (for Fever) + 1 (for Pain) = 2. However, if we assume that the FeverPAIN score includes additional components such as the severity of pain and other factors, let's use a more detailed approach. Let's use the following scoring system for FeverPAIN: - Fever: 1 point if present. - Pain: 1 point if mild, 2 points if moderate, 3 points if severe. From the patient note: - The patient has a low-grade fever. This gives 1 point for Fever. - The patient has severe neck pain. This gives 3 points for Pain.

<think> To calculate the patient's estimated gestational age, we need to determine the number of weeks and days since her last menstrual period (LMP). The patient's LMP was on July 18, 2010, and today's date is February 9, 2011. First, let's calculate the number of days between these two dates: February 9, 2011 - July 18, 2010 = approximately 246 days To convert these days to weeks and days, we can divide by 7: 246 days ÷ 7 = 35 weeks with no remaining days Therefore, the patient's estimated gestational age is 35 weeks, 0 days. </think>

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011. - From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: - July has 31 days. - Days from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. - August 2010 has 31 days. - September 2010 has 30 days. - October 2010 has 31 days. - November 2010 has 30 days. - December 2010 has 31 days. - January 2011 has 31 days. - And from February 1 to February 9, 2011, there are 9 days. Now, let's add up all these days: - Days in July from July 18 to July 31: 14 days. - Days in August: 31 days. - Days in September: 30 days. - Days in October: 31 days. - Days in November: 30 days. - Days in December: 31 days. - Days in January: 31 days. - Days in February from February 1 to February 9: 9 days. Adding them together: \[ 14 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 9 (February) \] Let's sum these step by step: \[ 14 + 31 = 45 \] \[ 45 + 30 = 75 \] \[ 75 + 31 = 106 \] \[ 106 + 30 = 136 \] \[ 136 + 31 = 167 \] \[ 167 + 31 = 198 \] \[ 198 + 9 = 207 \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 207 days. Now, we convert 207 days into weeks and days. \[ 207 \div 7 = 29.5714 \] This means there are 29 full weeks in 207 days. To find the number of remaining days, we calculate: \[ 207 - (29 \times 7) = 207 - 203 = 4 \] So, 207 days is equal to 29 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, the patient's estimated gestational age is 29 weeks and 4 days. It seems I made an error in my initial calculation. Let's correct it step-by-step. 1. Calculate the number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011. From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: - Days from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Now, we add the days for each month from August 2010 through January 2011: - August 2010: 31 days - September 2010: 30 days - October 2010: 31 days - November 2010: 30 days - December 2010: 31 days - January 2011: 31 days And from February 1 to February 9, 2011: - 9 days. Now, sum up all these days: \[ 14 (from July 18 to July 31) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 9 (February) \] Let's add them step by step: \[ 14 + 31 = 45 \] \[ 45 + 30 = 75 \] \[ 75 + 31 = 106 \] \[ 106 + 30 = 136 \] \[ 136 + 31 = 167 \] \[ 167 + 31 = 198 \] \[ 198 + 9 = 207 \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 207 days. To convert 207 days into weeks and days: \[ 207 \div 7 = 29 \text{ weeks and a remainder of } 207 - (29 \times 7) = 207 - 203 = 4 \text{ days.} \] Thus, the gestational age is 29 weeks and 4 days. So the correct answer is (29 weeks, 4 days). The final answer is (29 weeks, 4 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's estimated gestational age, we need to determine the number of days between the last menstrual period (July 18, 2010) and today's date (February 9, 2011). \n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of days from July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010. \n- July has 31 days. \n- Days from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days.\n\nStep 2: Add the number of days in each month from August 2010 through January 2011.\n- August 2010: 31 days\n- September 2010: 30 days\n- October 2010: 31 days\n- November 2010: 30 days\n- December 2010: 31 days\n- January 2011: 31 days\n\nStep 3: Add the number of days from February 1 to February 9, 2011.\n- 9 days.\n\nNow, sum up all these days:\n\[ 14 (from July 18 to July 31) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 9 (February). \] Let's add them step by step: \[ 14 + 31 = 45, \] \[ 45 + 30 = 75, \] \[ 75 + 31 = 106, \] \[ 106 + 30 = 136, \] \[ 136 + 31 = 167, \] \[ 167 + 31 = 198, \] \[ 198 + 9 = 207. \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 207 days.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The anion gap can be calculated using the following equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) In this patient: * Sodium: 137 mmol/L * Chloride: 98 mmol/L * Bicarbonate: 9 mmol/L Plugging these values into the equation: Anion Gap = 137 - (98 + 9) Anion Gap = 137 - 107 Anion Gap = 30 To calculate the delta gap, we subtract the normal anion gap value (12): Delta Gap = Anion Gap - 12 Delta Gap = 30 - 12 Delta Gap = 18 </step_by_step_thinking> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we used the equation Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate), which resulted in an Anion Gap of 30.

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling. The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues. He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained. On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative. Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ). The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

{'Row Number': 742, 'Calculator Name': 'Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '63', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7357312-1', 'Patient Note': "A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

However, the SOFA score for respiratory support also takes into account the use of mechanical ventilation or CPAP. - For patients on CPAP or mechanical ventilation, the score is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio and the level of support. - Since the patient is on CPAP and the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is 142.59, we need to check the criteria for mechanical support. - If the patient is on CPAP or mechanical ventilation and the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is between 100 and 200, the score is 3. - If the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is between 200 and 300, the score is 2. - If the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is between 300 and 400, the score is 1. - If the PaO₂/Fi₂ ratio is > 400, the score is 0. - Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is 142.59 and the patient is on CPAP, the score for the respiratory system is 3. 2. **Cardiovascular System (Blood Pressure and Vasopressor Support)**: - The patient's blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, which is within the normal range. - However, the patient is on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min respectively, and norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. - According to the SOFA scoring system for the cardiovascular system: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mmHg: Score = 0. - No vasopressors and MAP < 70 mmHg or any dose of dopamine or dobutamine: Score = 1. - Dopamine or dobutamine > 5 mcg/kg/min or any other vasopressor: Score = 2. - Norepinephrine or epinephrine > 0.1 mcg/kg/min or dopamine > 15 mcg/kg/min: Score = 3. - Norepinephrine or epinephrine > 0.2 mcg/kg/min or dopamine > 20 mcg/kg/min: Score = 4. - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: - DOPamine at 4 mcg/kg/min. - DOBUTamine at 3.5 mcg/kg/min. - norEPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min. - EPINEPHrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min. - Let's calculate the total vasopressor load: - Dopamine: 4 mcg/kg/min. - Dobutamine: 3.5 mcg/kg/min (dobutamine is not counted in the vasopressor score for SOFA). - Noradrenaline (norEPINEPHrine): 0.07 mcg/kg/min. - Adrenaline (EPINEPHrine): 0.03 mcg/kg/min. - The total effective vasopressor load is the sum of the doses of noradrenaline and adrenaline. - Noradrenaline: 0.07 mcg/kg/min. - Adrenaline: 0.03 mcg/kg/min. - Total = 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min. - Since the total vasopressor load (noradrenaline + adrenaline) is 0.1 mcg/kg/min, this falls into the category of norepinephrine or epinephrine > 0.1 mcg/kg/min. - Therefore, the score for the cardiovascular system is 3. 3. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Score)**: - The patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 13. - According to the SOFA scoring system for the CNS: - GCS 15: Score = 0. - GCS 14: Score = 1. - GCS 13: Score = 2. - GCS 12: Score = 3. - GCS < 12: Score = 4. - Since the patient's GCS is 13, the score for the CNS is 2. 4. **Hepatic System (Bilirubin Levels)**: - The patient's bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL. - According to the SOFA scoring system for the hepatic system: - Bilirubin ≤ 1.2: Score = 0. - 1.2 < Bilirubin ≤ 2: Score = 1. - 2 < Bilirubin ≤ 6: Score = 2. - 6 < Bilirubin ≤ 12: Score = 3. - Bilirubin > 12: Score = 4. - Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2 < Bilirubin ≤ 2. - Therefore, the score for the hepatic system is 1. 5. **Renal System (Creatinine and Urine Output)**: - The patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL. - The patient's urine output is 925 mL/day. - According to the SOFA scoring system for the renal system: - Creatinine ≤ 1.2: Score = 0. - 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9: Score = 1. - 1.9 < Creatinine ≤ 3.4: Score = 2. - 3.4 < Creatinine ≤ 4.9: Score = 3. - Creatinine > 4.9: Score = 4. - OR - Urine output < 200 mL/day: Score = 3. - Since the creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9. - Therefore, the score for the renal system based on creatinine is 1. - The urine output is 925 mL/day, which is above 200 mL/day. - Therefore, the score for the renal system based on urine output is 0. - We take the higher score between the two (creatinine and urine output). - The score for the renal system is 1 (from creatinine). 6. **Hematological System (Platelet Count)**: - The patient's platelet count is 180,000/μL. - According to the SOFA scoring system for the hematological system: - Platelets > 150,000: Score = 0. - 100,000 < Platelets ≤ 150,000: Score = 1. - 50,000 < Platelets ≤ 100,000: Score = 2. - 20,000 < Platelets ≤ 50,000: Score = 3. - Platelets ≤ 20,000: Score = 4. - Since the platelet count is 180,000/μL, it falls into the range > 150,000. - Therefore, the score for the hematological system is 0. Now, let's sum up the scores from each system: - Respiratory: 3 - Cardiovascular: 3 - CNS: 2 - Hepatic: 1 - Renal: 1 - Hematological: 0 Total SOFA score = 3 (respiratory) + 3 (cardiovascular) + 2 (CNS) + 1 (hepatic) + 1 (renal) + 0 (hematological) = 10. Therefore, the patient's SOFA score is 10. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's SOFA score, we will evaluate each component of the SOFA score step-by-step.\n\n1. **Respiratory System**:\n - The patient is on CPAP with FiO₂ = 54% (0.54), and PaO₂ = 77 mmHg.\n - Calculate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: $\\frac{77}{0.54} \\approx 142.59$.\n - Since the patient is on CPAP and the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is 142.59, which falls between 100 and 200, the score for the respiratory system is 3.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular System**:\n - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine (4 mcg/kg/min), DOBUTamine (3.5 mcg/kg/min), norEPINEPHrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min), and EPINEPHrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min).\n - The total effective vasopressor load (noradrenaline + adrenaline) is 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min.\n - Since the total vasopressor load is > 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score for the cardiovascular system is 3.\n\n3. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Score)**:\n - The patient's GCS is 13.\n - According to the SOFA scoring system, a GCS of 13 corresponds to a score of 2.\n\n4. **Hepatic System (Bilirubin Levels)**:\n - The patient's bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL.\n - Since 1.2 < Bilirubin ≤ 2, the score for the hepatic system is 1.\n\n5. **Renal System (Creatinine and Urine Output)**:\n - The patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL.\n - The urine output is 925 mL/day.\n - The creatinine level falls into the range 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9, giving a score of 1.\n - The urine output is > 200 mL/day, so the score for urine output is 0.\n - Therefore, the score for the renal system is 1 (from creatinine).\n\n6. **Hematological System (Platelet Count)**:\n - The patient's platelet count is 180,000/μL.\n - Since the platelet count is > 150,000, the score for the hematological system is 0.\n\nNow, we sum up the scores from each system:\n- Respiratory: 3\n- Cardiovascular: 3\n- CNS: 2\n- Hepatic: 1\n- Renal: 1\n- Hematological: 0\n\nTotal SOFA score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10.", "answer": "10"}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we need to understand what a delta gap is. The delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the normal anion gap value (usually set at 12 mEq/L). The anion gap can be calculated using the following equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) In this patient's lab results: * Sodium: 135 mmol/L * Chloride: 103 mmol/L * Bicarbonate: 19 mmol/L Plugging these values into the equation: Anion Gap = 135 - (103 + 19) Anion Gap = 135 - 122 Anion Gap = 13 To calculate the delta gap, we subtract the normal anion gap value (12): Delta Gap = Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap Delta Gap = 13 - 12 Delta Gap = 1

The APACHE II score is calculated using the following parameters: 1. Age 2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 4. Heart rate 5. Respiratory rate 6. Temperature 7. White blood cell count (WBC) 8. PaO2/FiO2 ratio 9. pH 10. PaCO2 11. Creatinine 12. Sodium 13. Potassium 14. Hematocrit 15. BUN 16. Glucose Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Age**: The patient is 73 years old. The age score is as follows: - Age 15-44: 0 points - Age 45-54: 2 points - Age 55-64: 4 points - Age 65-74: 6 points - Age ≥ 75: 8 points Since the patient is 73 years old, the age score is 6 points. 2. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: The patient's GCS is 15, which indicates full consciousness. The GCS score is as follows: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 14: 1 point - GCS 13: 2 points - GCS 12: 3 points - GCS 11: 4 points - GCS 10: 5 points - GCS 9: 6 points - GCS 8: 7 points - GCS 7: 8 points - GCS 6: 9 points - GCS 5: 10 points - GCS 4: 11 points - GCS 3: 12 points - GCS 2: 13 points - GCS 1: 14 points Since the patient's GCS is 15, the GCS score is 0 points. 3. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: The patient's blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg. The MAP can be calculated using the formula: MAP = Diastolic BP + 1/3 (Systolic BP - Diastolic BP). MAP = 92 + (1/3) * (138 - 92) = 92 + (1/3) * 46 = 92 + 15.33 ≈ 107.33 mmHg. The MAP score is as follows: - MAP ≥ 110: 0 points - MAP 100-109: 1 point - MAP 90-99: 2 points - MAP 80-89: 3 points - MAP 70-79: 4 points - MAP 60-69: 5 points - MAP 50-59: 6 points - MAP < 50: 7 points Since the MAP is approximately 107.33 mmHg, the MAP score is 0 points. 4. **Heart Rate**: The patient's heart rate is 107 beats per minute. The heart rate score is as follows: - Heart rate < 40: 4 points - Heart rate 40-49: 3 points - Heart rate 50-59: 2 points - Heart rate 60-100: 0 points - Heart rate 101-110: 1 point - Heart rate 111-120: 2 points - Heart rate 121-130: 3 points - Heart rate 131-140: 4 points - Heart rate > 140: 5 points Since the heart rate is 107 beats per minute, it falls into the range 101-110, so the heart rate score is 1 point. 5. **Respiratory Rate**: The patient's respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. The respiratory rate score is as follows: - Respiratory rate < 10: 3 points - Respiratory rate 10-11: 2 points - Respiratory rate 12-20: 0 points - Respiratory rate 21-24: 1 point - Respiratory rate 25-30: 2 points - Respiratory rate > 30: 3 points Since the respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, it falls into the > 30 range, so the respiratory rate score is 3 points. 6. **Temperature**: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. The temperature score is as follows: - Temperature < 35: 3 points - Temperature 35-35.9: 2 points - Temperature 36-38.4: 0 points - Temperature 38.5-38.9: 1 point - Temperature 39-39.4: 2 points - Temperature > 39.4: 3 points Since the temperature is 37.2°C, it falls into the 36-38.4 range, so the temperature score is 0 points. 7. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: The patient's WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL or 15.1 K/µL). The WBC score is as follows: - WBC < 1: 4 points - WBC 1-3: 3 points - WBC 3-6: 2 points - WBC 6-11: 0 points - WBC 11-15: 1 point - WBC 15-20: 2 points - WBC > 20: 3 points Since the WBC count is 15.1 K/µL, it falls into the 15-20 range, so the WBC score is 2 points. 8. **PaO2/FiO2 Ratio**: The patient's PaO2 is 78 mmHg and the FiO2 is 63% (0.63). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is calculated as: PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. The PaO2/FiO2 score is as follows: - PaO2/FiO2 > 400: 0 points - PaO2/FiO2 300-400: 1 point - PaO2/FiO2 200-299: 2 points - PaO2/FiO2 100-199: 3 points - PaO2/FiO2 < 100: 4 points Since the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is approximately 123.81, it falls into the 100-199 range, so the PaO2/FiO2 score is 3 points. 9. **pH**: The patient's pH is 7.29. The pH score is as follows: - pH > 7.6: 4 points - pH 7.5-7.59: 3 points - pH 7.35-7.45: 0 points - pH 7.25-7.34: 1 point - pH 7.15-7.24: 2 points - pH 7.05-7.14: 3 points - pH < 7.05: 4 points Since the pH is 7.29, it falls into the 7.25-7.34 range, so the pH score is 1 point. 10. **PaCO2**: We do not have the PaCO2 value directly provided. However, we can calculate it using the pH and the A-a gradient information. The A-a gradient is given as 331 mmHg, which seems incorrect because the A-a gradient is typically much lower. Let's assume there might be an error in the provided information. We will use the pH and other information to calculate the PaCO2 indirectly if possible. Since the pH is 7.29 (acidosis), and without the PaCO2, we can't directly use the PaCO2 score. Let's assume we need to use the pH score instead for now. 11. **Creatinine**: The patient's creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. The creatinine score is as follows: - Creatinine < 0.5: 0 points - Creatinine 0.5-0.9: 1 point - Creatinine 1-1.4: 2 points - Creatinine 1.5-1.9: 3 points - Creatinine 2-2.4: 4 points - Creatinine 2.5-2.9: 5 points - Creatinine 3-3.4: 6 points - Creatinine 3.5-3.9: 7 points - Creatinine 4-4.4: 8 points - Creatinine 4.5-4.9: 9 points - Creatinine 5-5.4: 10 points - Creatinine 5.5-5.9: 11 points - Creatinine 6-6.4: 12 points - Creatinine 6.5-6.9: 13 points - Creatinine 7-7.4: 14 points - Creatinine 7.5-7.9: 15 points - Creatinine ≥ 8: 16 points Since the creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL, it falls into the 4.5-4.9 range, so the creatinine score is 9 points. 12. **Sodium**: The patient's sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L. The sodium score is as follows: - Sodium < 120: 4 points - Sodium 120-129: 3 points - Sodium 130-134: 2 points - Sodium 135-144: 0 points - Sodium 145-149: 1 point - Sodium 150-155: 2 points - Sodium > 155: 3 points Since the sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L, it falls into the 135-144 range, so the sodium score is 0 points. 13. **Potassium**: The patient's potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L. The potassium score is as follows: - Potassium < 2.5: 4 points - Potassium 2.5-2.9: 3 points - Potassium 3-3.4: 2 points - Potassium 3.5-5.4: 0 points - Potassium 5.5-5.9: 1 point - Potassium 6-6.4: 2 points - Potassium 6.5-6.9: 3 points - Potassium ≥ 7: 4 points Since the potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L, it falls into the 3.5-5.4 range, so the potassium score is 0 points. 14. **Hematocrit**: The patient's hematocrit is 41%. The hematocrit score is as follows: - Hematocrit < 20: 4 points - Hematocrit 20-29: 3 points - Hematocrit 30-39: 2 points - Hematocrit 40-50: 0 points - Hematocrit > 50: 1 point Since the hematocrit is 41%, it falls into the 40-50 range, so the hematocrit score is 0 points. Now, let's sum up the scores we have calculated: - Age: 6 points - GCS: 0 points - MAP: 0 points - Heart rate: 1 point - Respiratory rate: 3 points - Temperature: 0 points - WBC: 2 points - PaO2/FiO2: 3 points - pH: 1 point - Creatinine: 9 points - Sodium: 0 points - Potassium: 0 points - Hematocrit: 0 points Adding these up: 6 (Age) + 0 (GCS) + 0 (MAP) + 1 (Heart rate) + 3 (Respiratory rate) + 0 (Temperature) + 2 (WBC) + 3 (PaO2/FiO2) + 1 (pH) + 9 (Creatinine) + 0 (Sodium) + 0 (Potassium) + 0 (Hematocrit) = 25 points. So the APACHE II score is 25. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score for the patient, we need to evaluate several parameters including age, GCS, MAP, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, WBC, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, pH, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and hematocrit.

The Fridericia formula actually uses the cube root of the heart rate in seconds (or RR interval), not the square root. The correct formula is: QTc = QT / (RR)^1/3. Let's correct this step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the heart rate to the RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 170 bpm. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60 \text{ seconds}}{\text{heart rate in bpm}} = \frac{60}{170} \approx 0.353 \text{ seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} / \sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec (or 0.330 seconds), and the RR interval is approximately 0.353 seconds, we can plug these values into the formula. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \frac{330 \text{ msec}}{\sqrt[3]{0.353}}. \] Now, we need to calculate the cube root of 0.353. \[ \sqrt[3]{0.353} \approx 0.7067. \] Now, we can calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \frac{330}{0.7067} \approx 466.9 \text{ msec}. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 467 msec. So the patient's corrected QT interval is approximately 467 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula, we use the formula: QTc_F = QT / (RR)^(1/3).

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

S - Medications: The patient is on levetiracetam. </think> <think> Let's evaluate each component of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the given patient: - C (Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction): No mention of congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Score = 0. - H (Hypertension): No mention of hypertension. Score = 0. - A (Age ≥ 75 years): The patient is 55 years old. Score = 0. - D (Diabetes Mellitus): No mention of diabetes mellitus. Score = 0. - S (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism): The patient has had syncopal episodes, but these are not explicitly described as strokes or TIAs. However, the syncopal episodes could potentially be related to cardiac issues or other conditions. Since the patient has had syncopal episodes and one of them was associated with a seizure, it's not clear if this qualifies as a stroke or TIA. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume that the syncopal episodes do not count as a stroke or TIA unless explicitly stated. Score = 0. - V (Vascular disease): No mention of vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque. Score = 0. - A (Age 65-74 years): The patient is 55 years old. Score = 0. - S (Sex category: female): The patient is male. Score = 0. Now let's sum up the scores for the components that we have evaluated: - Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction: 0 - Hypertension: 0 - Age ≥ 75 years: 0 - Diabetes Mellitus: 0 - Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism: 0 - Vascular disease: 0 - Age 65-74 years: 0 - Sex category (female): 0 However, let's re-evaluate the components more carefully: - C (Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction): No evidence of congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Score = 0. - H (Hypertension): No mention of hypertension. Score = 0. - A (Age ≥ 75 years): The patient is 55 years old, so this criterion is not met. Score = 0. - D (Diabetes Mellitus): No mention of diabetes mellitus. Score = 0. - S (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism): The patient has had syncopal episodes, but they are not explicitly described as strokes or TIAs. Since the syncopal episodes could be due to cardiac issues (like sinus arrest), we should consider if these episodes could be counted as a stroke or TIA. Given the context, it seems the syncopal episodes are more related to cardiac issues rather than a stroke. Score = 0. - V (Vascular disease): No mention of vascular disease such as myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque. Score = 0. - A (Age 65-74 years): The patient is 55 years old, so this criterion is not met. Score = 0. - S (Sex category: female): The patient is male. Score = 0. So the total score is: 0 (C) + 0 (H) + 0 (A for age ≥ 75) + 0 (D) + 0 (S) + 0 (V) + 0 (A for age 65-74) + 0 (S for sex) = 0. But let's consider the CHA2DS2-VASc score components again with the information given: CHA2DS2-VASc Score Components: - C: Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (1 point) - H: Hypertension (1 point) - A: Age ≥ 75 years (1 point) - D: Diabetes Mellitus (1 point) - S: Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (2 points) - V: Vascular disease (1 point) - A: Age 65-74 years (1 point) - S: Sex category (female) (1 point) Now let's apply the information from the patient's history: - Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction: No evidence. Score = 0. - Hypertension: No mention. Score = 0. - Age ≥ 75 years: The patient is 55 years old. Score = 0. - Diabetes Mellitus: No mention. Score = 0. - Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism: No explicit mention of stroke or TIA. The syncopal episodes might be related to cardiac issues rather than stroke. Score = 0. - Vascular disease: No mention. Score = 0. - Age 65-74 years: The patient is 55 years old. Score = 0. - Sex category (female): The patient is male. Score = 0. Thus the total CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. So the final CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to evaluate each component of the score based on the provided information.\n\n- C (Congestive Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction): No evidence of congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Serum albumin level: 3.1 g/dL 3. Prothrombin time (INR): 2.1 4. Ascites: Negative 5. Encephalopathy: Present (patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis) Therefore, applying the Child-Pugh scoring system: Child-Pugh Score = 3 </think> Let's score each component one by one: 1. **Serum Bilirubin:** - The bilirubin level is 40.2 umol/L. - 1 umol/L = 0.059 mg/dL, so 40.2 umol/L = 40.2 * 0.059 = 2.3718 mg/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - 3-6 mg/dL = 3 points - > 6 mg/dL = 4 points - Since 2.3718 mg/dL falls within the range of 2-3 mg/dL, the score for bilirubin is 2 points. 2. **Serum Albumin:** - The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - 2.1-2.8 g/dL = 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL = 4 points - Since 3.1 g/dL falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, the score for albumin is 2 points. 3. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** - The INR is 2.1. - According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - 2.4-3.0 = 3 points - > 3.0 = 4 points - Since 2.1 falls within the range of 1.7-2.3, the score for INR is 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - The patient's abdominal exam is negative for ascites. - According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - None = 1 point - Controlled medically = 2 points - Difficult to control = 3 points - Since the patient has no ascites, the score for ascites is 1 point. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - The patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis, indicating the presence of encephalopathy. - According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - None = 1 point - Grade I-II = 2 points - Grade III-IV = 3 points - The patient's confusion and asterixis suggest the presence of encephalopathy, likely at least Grade I-II (mild to moderate). Therefore, the score for encephalopathy is 2 points. Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - Bilirubin: 2 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 points. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B.

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

The concentration value of 40.2 µmol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass. Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma. We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee. Here is the task: What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To determine the number of SIRS criteria met by this patient, let's break it down: SIRS is a clinical criterion that defines systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which is characterized by two or more of the following: 1. Body temperature less than 98°F (36.7°C) or greater than 103°F (39.4°C). 2. Heart rate greater than 90 beats/min. 3. Respiratory rate greater than 30 or PaCO2 less than 40 mm Hg. 4. White blood cell count greater than 15,000 cells/mm^3 or less than 4,000 cells/mm^3. In this patient: * Body temperature: 38.5°C, which meets criterion 1. * Heart rate: 68 beats/min, which meets criterion 2. * Respiratory rate: 20/min, which does not meet criterion 3. * White blood cell count: 8,000/mm^3, which meets criterion 4. Therefore, this patient meets 3 out of the 4 SIRS criteria. </step> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To determine the number of SIRS criteria met by this patient, we evaluated four key indicators: body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count. The patient's temperature (38.5°C), heart rate (68 beats/min), and white blood cell count (8,000/mm^3) meet the criteria for SIRS, while the respiratory rate (20/min) does not. Therefore, this patient meets 3 out of the 4 SIRS criteria.", "answer": "3"}</think> So the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2. Let's check each criterion one by one: 1. Body temperature: The patient's body temperature is 38.5°C. The SIRS criterion for body temperature is either less than 36.0°C (96.8°F) or greater than 38.0°C (100.4°F). Since 38.5°C is greater than 38.0°C, this criterion is met. 2. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is 68 beats per minute. The SIRS criterion for heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute. Since 68 beats per minute is not greater than 90, this criterion is not met. 3. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. The SIRS criterion for respiratory rate is either greater than 20 breaths per minute or a PaCO2 less than 32 mm Hg. The respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, which is not greater than 20. We also need to check the PaCO2. From the arterial blood gas analysis, the PCO2 is 36.3 mm Hg, which is not less than 32 mm Hg. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 4. White blood cell count: The patient's white blood cell count is 8,000/mm^3. The SIRS criterion for white blood cell count is either greater than 12,000/mm^3 or less than 4,000/mm^3, or the presence of more than 10% immature (band) forms. The white blood cell count is 8,000/mm^3, which is between 4,000 and 12,000/mm^3 and does not meet the criterion. So, let's count the number of criteria met: - Body temperature: Met (38.5°C > 38.0°C) - Heart rate: Not met (68 bpm ≤ 90 bpm) - Respiratory rate: Not met (20 breaths/min ≤ 20 breaths/min and PCO2 36.3 mm Hg ≥ 32 mm Hg) - White blood cell count: Not met (8,000/mm^3 is between 4,000 and 12,000/mm^3) Thus, only 1 criterion is met (body temperature). Therefore, the correct number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 1. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To determine the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient, we will evaluate each of the four SIRS criteria based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n1. Body Temperature: The patient's body temperature is 38.5°C. The SIRS criterion for body temperature is either less than 36.0°C or greater than 38.0°C. Since 38.5°C is greater than 38.0°C, this criterion is met.\n\n2. Heart Rate: The patient's heart rate is 68 beats per minute. The SIRS criterion for heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute. Since 68 beats per minute is not greater than 90, this criterion is not met.\n\n3. Respiratory Rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. The SIRS criterion for respiratory rate is either greater than 20 breaths per minute or a PaCO2 less than 32 mm Hg. The respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, which is not greater than 20.

Since the white blood cell count is 8,000/mm^3, which is between 4,000 and 12,000/mm^3, this criterion is not met.\n\nIn summary, out of the four SIRS criteria, only the body temperature criterion is met.\n\nTherefore, the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 1.", "answer": "1"}

The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To convert the Hydrocortisone IV dose to Prednisone PO, we use the conversion factor that 1 mg of Prednisone is roughly equivalent to 4 mg of Hydrocortisone.

Let's correct it step-by-step. 1. The conversion factor between Hydrocortisone and Prednisone is that 1 mg of Prednisone is roughly equivalent to 4 mg of Hydrocortisone. This means that to convert from Hydrocortisone to Prednisone, you divide the Hydrocortisone dose by 4. Given: 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV. To find the equivalent dose in Prednisone: \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose} = \frac{\text{Hydrocortisone dose}}{4} = \frac{152.535}{4} = 38.13375 \, \text{mg} \] Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately 38.13 mg.

<think> To convert Prednisone PO to Hydrocortisone IV, we need to consider that Prednisone is a prodrug that is converted to Hydrocortisone in the body. The conversion ratio between Prednisone and Hydrocortisone is approximately 1:1.

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's CURBS-65 score, let's break it down: CURBS-65 is a clinical prediction rule used to determine the severity of illness in patients admitted to the hospital with suspected pneumonia. The five key components are: C - Confusion U - Urea level > 7 g/dL above the normal range (> 6.0 mmol/L) R - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 B - Blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic S - Shock 65 - Age ≥ 65 years In this patient: * C: The patient is not confused. * U: Urea level is 21, which is above the normal range (> 6.0 mmol/L). * R: Respiratory rate is 19, which is below 30. * B: Blood pressure is 121/79, which is above 90 mmHg. * S: The patient does not appear to be in shock. * 65: The patient is under 65 years old. Therefore, this patient's CURBS-65 score is 1.

Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

<think> To calculate the patient's CURBS-65 score, let's break it down: CURBS-65 is a clinical prediction rule used to determine the severity of illness in patients admitted to the hospital with suspected pneumonia. The five key components are: C - Confusion U - Urea level > 7 g/dL above the normal range (> 6.0 mmol/L) R - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 B - Blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic S - Shock 65 - Age ≥ 65 years In this patient: * C: The patient is not confused. * U: Urea level is 21, which is above the normal range (> 6.0 mmol/L). * R: Respiratory rate is 19, which is below 30. * B: Blood pressure is 121/79, which is above 90 mmHg. * S: The patient does not appear to be in shock. * 65: The patient is under 65 years old. Therefore, this patient's CURBS-65 score is 1. </think>

Step 1: Convert HYDROMORPHONE to MME. - The conversion factor for HYDROMORPHONE to MME is 4. That means 1 mg of HYDROMORPHONE is equivalent to 4 mg of morphine. - The patient takes 10 mg of HYDROMORPHONE once a day. Therefore, the daily dose in MME is: \[ 10 \, \text{mg HYDROMORPHONE} \times 4 = 40 \, \text{MME}. \] Step 2: Convert FENTANYL patch to MME. - The conversion factor for FENTANYL patches is as follows: a 100 mcg/hour patch is equivalent to approximately 25 mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl, and the conversion to MME is approximately 1 mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl = 0.02 mg of morphine per day. - However, the given dose is 40 mg of FENTANYL patch 3 times a day, which seems unusual because Fentanyl patches are typically used once every 72 hours (every 3 days), and the doses are usually given in mcg/hour (e.g., 25 mcg/hour, 50 mcg/hour, etc.), not in mg. It appears there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the dose. Let's assume the 40 mg refers to the strength of the patch, and it's likely that the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour patch. The conversion for a Fentanyl patch is as follows: - A 25 mcg/hour patch is approximately equivalent to 25 mcg/hour * 24 hours * 0.02 mg morphine/mcg/hour = 12 mg of morphine per day. - For a 40 mcg/hour patch, the MME would be: \[ \left(\frac{40}{25}\right) \times 12 \, \text{mg morphine/day} = \left(\frac{40}{25}\right) \times 12 = 1.6 \times 12 = 19.2 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] If the patient is using the 40 mcg/hour patch 3 times a day, this seems incorrect since patches are not typically applied multiple times a day. Let's assume the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour patch once every 72 hours (every 3 days), and we'll calculate the daily MME for this patch. If the patient uses a 40 mcg/hour patch every 3 days, the daily MME would be the MME for the patch divided by 3 days. So, the MME for a 40 mcg/hour patch is approximately 19.2 mg/day for the duration it is active (which is typically 72 hours). Therefore, the daily MME contribution from the patch over the course of a day is: \[ \frac{19.2 \, \text{mg MME}}{3 \, \text{days}} \approx 6.4 \, \text{mg MME/day}. \] But if the problem intends that the patient is using multiple patches in a day, it's likely an error. Let's assume the patient is using a single 40 mcg/hour patch every 72 hours. Step 3: Convert TRAMADOL to MME. - The conversion factor for TRAMADOL to MME is approximately 0.1. That means 1 mg of TRAMADOL is equivalent to 0.1 mg of morphine. - The patient takes 60 mg of TRAMADOL 2 times a day. Therefore, the total daily dose of TRAMADOL is: \[ 60 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{mg/day}. \] - Converting this to MME: \[ 120 \, \text{mg TRAMADOL} \times 0.1 = 12 \, \text{MME}. \] Now, let's sum up all the MME from each medication: - HYDROMORPHONE: 40 MME/day - FENTANYL (assuming a 40 mcg/hour patch used once every 72 hours): approximately 6.4 MME/day - TRAMADOL: 12 MME/day Adding these together gives us the total daily MME: \[ 40 \, \text{MME} + 6.4 \, \text{MME} + 12 \, \text{MME} = 58.4 \, \text{MME}. \] However, if the Fentanyl dose is misinterpreted and the 40 mg is not referring to a patch but some other form, let's consider another approach. If the 40 mg of Fentanyl is meant to be an oral or parenteral dose (which is highly unusual and dangerous), the conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME is 1 mg of Fentanyl = 100 mg of morphine. So, if the patient takes 40 mg of Fentanyl 3 times a day, the total daily dose in MME would be: \[ 40 \, \text{mg Fentanyl} \times 100 \, \text{(conversion factor)} \times 3 \, \text{(times a day)} = 40 \times 100 \times 3 = 12000 \, \text{MME}. \] This is an extremely high and dangerous dose and seems unrealistic. Let's assume the Fentanyl is a patch and use the earlier calculation for the patch. So the total MME is: \[ 40 \, \text{(from HYDROMORPHONE)} + 6.4 \, \text{(from FENTANYL patch)} + 12 \, \text{(from TRAMADOL)} = 58.4 \, \text{MME}. \] Thus, the final answer is 58.4 MME. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its equivalent dose of morphine.\n\nStep 1: Convert HYDROMORPHONE to MME.\n- The conversion factor for HYDROMORPHONE to MME is 4.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

<think> To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the following formula can be used: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 - age) × weight (in kg) / (72 × serum creatinine level (mg/dL)) In this patient: * Age: 66 years * Weight: 68 kg * Serum creatinine level: 5.09 mg/dL Plugging these values into the equation: CrCl = (140 - 66) × 68 / (72 × 5.09) CrCl = 74 × 68 / 368.08 CrCl = 5088 / 368.08 CrCl ≈ 13.73 </think>

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future. As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%. Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period. The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position. During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery.

Let's calculate the patient's BMI first. The patient's height is 168.0 cm, and the weight is 68 kg. The formula for BMI is: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2 The patient's height in meters is 1.68 m. So, the BMI = 68 / (1.68)^2 = 68 / 2.8224 ≈ 24.09 Since the patient's BMI is approximately 24.09, which is within the normal range (normal BMI range is 18.5 - 24.9), we will use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight for the adjusted body weight. To calculate the ideal body weight (IBW), we use the formula for men: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet. First, convert the patient's height from cm to inches. 1 inch = 2.54 cm So, the patient's height in inches is 168 cm / 2.54 ≈ 66.14 inches. Since 5 feet is 60 inches, the height over 5 feet is 66.14 - 60 = 6.14 inches. Using the formula for ideal body weight: IBW = 50 + 2.3 * 6.14 ≈ 50 + 14.12 ≈ 64.12 kg. Now we have the actual weight = 68 kg and the ideal body weight ≈ 64.12 kg. Since the patient's BMI is within the normal range, we use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight for the adjusted body weight. The minimum of 68 kg (actual weight) and 64.12 kg (ideal weight) is 64.12 kg. Now we will use the adjusted body weight (64.12 kg) in the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is: CrCl = (140 - age) × weight / (72 × serum creatinine) Plugging in the values: Age = 66 years Weight = 64.12 kg Serum creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL CrCl = (140 - 66) × 64.12 / (72 × 5.09) Calculate step by step: 1. Calculate (140 - 66): 140 - 66 = 74 2. Multiply this result by the adjusted weight (64.12): 74 × 64.12 ≈ 4744.088 3. Calculate the denominator (72 × 5.09): 72 × 5.09 ≈ 366.48 Now, divide the numerator by the denominator: CrCl ≈ 4744.088 / 366.48 ≈ 12.95 mL/min So the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation is approximately 12.95 mL/min. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL).

The Rautaharju formula is not the one I used above. The Rautaharju formula for correcting the QT interval is actually given by the following formula: \[ QTc = QT + 0.154 \times (1 - \frac{HR}{100}) \] But it seems there might be some confusion. Let's use the Bazett's formula for the corrected QT interval, which is commonly used and is given by: \[ QTc_B = \frac{QT}{\sqrt{RR}} \] where the RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated from the heart rate. Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 136 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec To find the RR interval in seconds: \[ RR = \frac{60}{HR} = \frac{60}{136} \approx 0.4412 \, \text{seconds} \] Now, we will use Bazett's formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ QTc_B = \frac{QT}{\sqrt{RR}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.4412}} \] Let's calculate the square root of 0.4412: \[ \sqrt{0.4412} \approx 0.6642 \] Now, we can calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ QTc_B = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.57 \, \text{msec} \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 497 msec. So the corrected QT interval using Bazett's formula is approximately 497 msec. However, if we use the Rautaharju formula for the corrected QT interval, the formula is: \[ QTc_R = QT + 0.154 \times (1 - \frac{HR}{100}) \] Let's calculate this step by step. Given: - QT = 330 msec - HR = 136 bpm Plugging in the values into the Rautaharju formula: \[ QTc_R = 330 + 0.154 \times \left(1 - \frac{136}{100}\right) \] Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: \[ 1 - \frac{136}{100} = 1 - 1.36 = -0.36 \] Now multiply this by 0.154: \[ 0.154 \times (-0.36) = -0.05544 \] Now add this result to the QT interval: \[ QTc_R = 330 + (-0.05544) = 330 - 0.05544 \approx 329.94 \, \text{msec} \] So the corrected QT interval using the Rautaharju formula is approximately 329.94 msec, which rounds to 330 msec. It seems that the Rautaharju formula gives a corrected QT interval that is very close to the original QT interval. Since the task specifies using the Rautaharju formula, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. Thus, the final answer is 330 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Rautaharju formula, we use the formula: \[ QTc_R = QT + 0.154 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{HR}{100}\\right). \] Given: - QT interval = 330 msec - Heart rate (HR) = 136 bpm Let's plug in the values into the Rautaharju formula.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

<think> To calculate the patient's serum osmololarity in terms of mOsm/kg, we can use the following formula: Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 × (Sodium level in mEq/L) + (Glucose level in mg/dL/18) + (Urea nitrogen level in mg/dL/2.1) In this patient: * Sodium level: 133 mEq/L * Glucose level: 569 mg/dL * Urea nitrogen level: 25.9 mg/dL Plugging these values into the formula: Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 × 133 + (569/18) + (25.9/2.1) = 266 + 31.94 + 12.23 = 310 </think>

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL).

Step 1: Calculate the contribution from sodium. The sodium level is 133 mmol/L (or mEq/L since sodium is monovalent). The contribution from sodium is 2 × 133 = 266 mOsm/kg. Step 2: Calculate the contribution from glucose. The glucose level is 569 mg/dL. The contribution from glucose is $\frac{569}{18}$ mOsm/kg. $\frac{569}{18} \approx 31.61$ mOsm/kg. Step 3: Calculate the contribution from blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The BUN level is 25.9 mg/dL. The contribution from BUN is $\frac{25.9}{2.8}$ mOsm/kg. Note that the formula often uses 2.8 instead of 2.1 for BUN. Let's use the more common formula with 2.8 for BUN. $\frac{25.9}{2.8} \approx 9.25$ mOsm/kg. Now, sum up all the contributions: Osmolality = 266 (from sodium) + 31.61 (from glucose) + 9.25 (from BUN). Adding these together: Osmolality = 266 + 31.61 + 9.25 = 306.86 mOsm/kg. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 307 mOsm/kg. So the patient's serum osmolality is approximately 307 mOsm/kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's serum osmolality, we use the formula: Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 × [Na+] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

We have the heart rate (HR) = 144 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. To use the Framingham formula for the corrected QT interval, we need to calculate the RR interval in seconds. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated as RR = 60 / HR. 3. Plugging in the heart rate: RR = 60 / 144 ≈ 0.4167 seconds. 4. Now we use the Framingham formula for the corrected QT interval: QTc = QT / √RR. 5. Plugging in the values, we get: QTc = 330 / √0.4167. 6. Calculate the square root of 0.4167: √0.4167 ≈ 0.6455. 7. Now, divide the QT interval by this value: QTc ≈ 330 / 0.6455 ≈ 511.3 msec. It seems I made an error in the previous calculation. Let's redo it step by step. 1. The heart rate is 144 bpm. 2. Calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 144 = 0.4167 seconds. 3. Use the Framingham formula: QTc = QT / √RR. 4. The QT interval is 330 msec. 5. Calculate √0.4167 ≈ 0.6455. 6. Now, calculate the corrected QT interval: QTc = 330 / 0.6455 ≈ 511.3 msec. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 511 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 511 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's corrected QT (QTc) interval using the Framingham formula, we use the formula: QTc = QT / √RR.

The patient's sodium level is 139 mEq/L. </think> However, the term "corrected sodium concentration" often refers to correcting the sodium level for the presence of hyperglycemia. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (0.016 * (Serum Glucose - 100)) The patient's serum glucose is 129 mg/dL. Let's use this formula to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. Step 1: Identify the measured sodium concentration. Measured Sodium = 139 mEq/L Step 2: Identify the serum glucose level. Serum Glucose = 129 mg/dL Step 3: Use the formula to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. Corrected Sodium = 139 + (0.016 * (129 - 100)) Now, let's do the math step by step. Step 4: Calculate the difference between the serum glucose and 100. 129 - 100 = 29 Step 5: Multiply this difference by 0.016. 0.016 * 29 = 0.464 Step 6: Add this result to the measured sodium concentration. Corrected Sodium = 139 + 0.464 = 139.464 Rounding to one decimal place, the corrected sodium concentration is approximately 139.5 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), we need to assign points for each of his comorbidities based on the following criteria: 1. Myocardial infarction: 1 point 2. Congestive heart failure: 1 point 3. Stroke: 1 point 4. Diabetes mellitus: 1 point 5. Chronic liver disease: 1 point 6. Cancer: 1 point 7. Renal disease: 0 points (this patient does not have chronic kidney disease) 8. Dementia: 0.5 points 9. Connective tissue disease: 0.5 points Applying these points to the patient: * Myocardial infarction: None * Congestive heart failure: 1 point * Stroke: 1 point * Diabetes mellitus: 1 point * Chronic liver disease: 1 point * Cancer: 1 point (he had hepatoblastoma) * Renal disease: 0 points * Dementia: 0.5 points * Connective tissue disease: 0.5 points Therefore, the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score would be: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 7

Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

<think> To calculate the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), we need to assign points for each of his comorbidities based on the following criteria: 1. Myocardial infarction: 1 point 2. Congestive heart failure: 1 point 3. Stroke: 1 point 4. Diabetes mellitus: 1 point 5. Chronic liver disease: 1 point 6. Cancer: 1 point 7. Renal disease: 0 points (this patient does not have chronic kidney disease) 8. Dementia: 0.5 points 9. Connective tissue disease: 0.5 points Applying these points to the patient: * Myocardial infarction: None * Congestive heart failure: 1 point * Stroke: 1 point * Diabetes mellitus: 1 point * Chronic liver disease: 1 point * Cancer: 1 point (he had hepatoblastoma) * Renal disease: 0 points * Dementia: 0.5 points * Connective tissue disease: 0.5 points Therefore, the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score would be: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 7 </think>

It corresponds to 1 point in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 2. **Diabetes Mellitus**: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus. This condition is worth 1 point. 3. **Dementia**: The patient has dementia. According to the Charlson Comorbidity Index, dementia is worth 0.5 points. 4. **Severe Liver Disease**: The note mentions that the patient presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease. Severe liver disease is worth 1 point. 5. **Cancer**: The patient has a history of hepatoblastoma (in remission) and leukemia. Both of these conditions fall under the category of cancer. The Charlson Comorbidity Index assigns 1 point for cancer (excluding non-metastatic skin cancer). Since the patient has both hepatoblastoma and leukemia, we count this as 1 point for cancer. 6. **Stroke**: The patient has a history of cerebral vascular accident (stroke). This is worth 1 point. 7. **Connective Tissue Disease**: The patient has connective tissue disease, which is worth 0.5 points according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Now, let's add up the points: - Congestive Heart Failure: 1 point - Diabetes Mellitus: 1 point - Dementia: 0.5 points - Severe Liver Disease: 1 point - Cancer: 1 point - Stroke: 1 point - Connective Tissue Disease: 0.5 points Adding these up: \[ 1 (Congestive Heart Failure) + 1 (Diabetes Mellitus) + 0.5 (Dementia) + 1 (Severe Liver Disease) + 1 (Cancer) + 1 (Stroke) + 0.5 (Connective Tissue Disease) \] Let's do the math step by step: \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \] \[ 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 \] \[ 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 \] \[ 3.5 + 1 = 4.5 \] \[ 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 \] \[ 5.5 + 0.5 = 6 \] So the total Charlson Comorbidity Index score is 6.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's maintenance fluids based on their weight, we can use the Holliday formula: 4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg of body weight 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg of body weight (11-20 kg) 1 mL/kg/h for any weight above 20 kg The patient weighs 38.1 kg, so let's break it down: For the first 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 40 mL/hr For the next 10 kg (11-20 kg): 2 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 20 mL/hr For the remaining 18.1 kg (>20 kg): 1 mL/kg/hr × 18.1 kg = 18.1 mL/hr Adding these values together, the patient's maintenance fluid requirement would be: 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 18.1 mL/hr = 78.1 mL/hr

Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

<think> To calculate the patient's maintenance fluids based on their weight, we can use the Holliday formula: 4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg of body weight 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg of body weight (11-20 kg) 1 mL/kg/h for any weight above 20 kg The patient weighs 38.1 kg, so let's break it down: For the first 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 40 mL/hr For the next 10 kg (11-20 kg): 2 mL/kg/hr × 10 kg = 20 mL/hr For the remaining 18.1 kg (>20 kg): 1 mL/kg/hr × 18.1 kg = 18.1 mL/hr Adding these values together, the patient's maintenance fluid requirement would be: 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 18.1 mL/hr = 78.1 mL/hr </think>

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene). The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2. At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL). The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh Score, let's break it down: The Child-Pugh score is a scoring system used to assess the severity of liver disease in patients with cirrhosis. It considers five key factors: 1. Serum bilirubin level 2. INR (International Normalized Ratio) 3. Albumin level 4. Ascites presence 5. Encephalopathy grade In this patient: 1. Serum bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL 2. INR: 1.6 3. Albumin: 3.3 g/dL 4. There is no mention of ascites in the patient's history. 5. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Now, let's assign points based on these factors: * Serum bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL = 1 point * INR: 1.6 = 1 point * Albumin: 3.3 g/dL = 1 point * Ascites: 0 points (no ascites) * Encephalopathy: 3-4 points = 3 points Therefore, the patient's Child-Pugh Score is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 6

<think> To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh Score, let's break it down: The Child-Pugh score is a scoring system used to assess the severity of liver disease in patients with cirrhosis. It considers five key factors: 1. Serum bilirubin level 2. INR (International Normalized Ratio) 3. Albumin level 4. Ascites presence 5. Encephalopathy grade In this patient: 1. Serum bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL 2. INR: 1.6 3. Albumin: 3.3 g/dL 4. There is no mention of ascites in the patient's history. 5. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Now, let's assign points based on these factors: * Serum bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL = 1 point * INR: 1.6 = 1 point * Albumin: 3.3 g/dL = 1 point * Ascites: 0 points (no ascites) * Encephalopathy: 3-4 points = 3 points Therefore, the patient's Child-Pugh Score is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 6 </think>

The Child-Pugh scoring system is as follows: **Serum Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - <1: 1 point - 1-3: 2 points - 3-6: 3 points - >6: 4 points The patient's bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls into the range 1-3. Therefore, it gets 2 points. **INR:** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.6, which is <1.7. Therefore, it gets 1 point. **Albumin (g/dL):** - >3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.8: 3 points - <2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 3.3 g/dL, which falls into the range 2.8-3.5. Therefore, it gets 2 points. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points Since there is no mention of ascites, we will assume it is "None." Therefore, it gets 1 point. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade I-II: 2 points - Grade III-IV: 3 points The patient has stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy, which corresponds to Grade III-IV. Therefore, it gets 3 points. Now, let's add up the points for each parameter: - Serum Bilirubin: 2 points - INR: 1 point - Albumin: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Encephalopathy: 3 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 9.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:

Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

The problem statement mentions that the patient has a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L. The delta gap is the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap (typically 8-16 mEq/L, but the normal anion gap is often taken as 12 mEq/L for simplicity). So, the given anion gap is 20.8 mEq/L. The delta gap is calculated as: Delta Gap = Measured Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap If the normal anion gap is taken as 12 mEq/L, then: Delta Gap = 20.8 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 8.8 mEq/L Thus, the patient's delta gap is 8.8 mEq/L. Let's also consider the other anion gap values mentioned in the patient's progress: On day 2, the anion gap was 16.2 mEq/L. Delta Gap on day 2 = 16.2 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 4.2 mEq/L On day 3, the anion gap was 13.2 mEq/L. Delta Gap on day 3 = 13.2 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 1.2 mEq/L But the question seems to be asking for the initial delta gap when the patient presented to the emergency department. So the initial anion gap is 20.8 mEq/L. Thus, the initial delta gap is: Delta Gap = 20.8 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 8.8 mEq/L Therefore, the answer is 8.8 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap, we use the formula: Delta Gap = Measured Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap. The measured anion gap given in the patient note is 20.8 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mEq/L. Therefore, the delta gap is calculated as follows: Delta Gap = 20.8 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 8.8 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

Since the note says the patient has hypertension and it's poorly controlled, we'll assume this criterion is met, so 1 point. - A (Age ≥ 65 years): 1 point if the patient is ≥ 65 years old. The patient is 67 years old, so 1 point. - S (Stroke): 1 point if the patient has a history of stroke. No mention of stroke, so 0 points. - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 1 point if the patient has a history of bleeding or a predisposition to bleeding. The patient has had a major bleeding episode in the past, so 1 point. - L (Labile INR): 1 point if the patient has labile INR (INR outside the therapeutic range in the last 4 weeks). Not mentioned, so 0 points. - E (Renal disease): 1 point if the patient has renal disease. No renal disease is mentioned, so 0 points. - D (Drugs or alcohol): 1 point if the patient is taking drugs that increase bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs) or has a history of alcohol abuse. The patient admits to mild alcohol consumption (about 3 drinks per week), which is not considered heavy alcohol use, and he is not taking any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding, so 0 points. Now let's sum up the points: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Age ≥ 65 years): 1 point - S (Stroke): 0 points - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 1 point - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Renal disease): 0 points - D (Drugs or alcohol): 0 points Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3. So the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for the patient, we will evaluate each component of the HAS-BLED scoring system:\n\n- H (Hypertension): The patient has a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which is poorly controlled.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

We have the heart rate (HR) = 81 bpm and the QT interval = 330 msec. 2. We need to calculate the RR interval. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and can be calculated as the inverse of the heart rate in seconds. The formula is RR = 60 / HR. So, RR = 60 / 81 ≈ 0.7407 seconds. 3. Now we use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc): QTc = QT / √RR. Here, QT = 330 msec and RR ≈ 0.7407 seconds. 4. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.7407 ≈ 0.8606. 5. Now, plug in the values into the formula: QTc = 330 / 0.8606 ≈ 383.5 msec. It seems I made an approximation error in the previous thinking. Let's do the calculation step by step more accurately. 1. Calculate the RR interval: RR = 60 / 81 ≈ 0.7407 seconds. 2. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: √0.7407 ≈ 0.8606. 3. Now, use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: QTc = 330 / 0.8606 ≈ 383.5 msec. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 384 msec. So the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is approximately 384 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's corrected QT (QTc) interval using the Framingham formula, we use the formula: QTc = QT / √RR.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

Therefore, the patient scores 0 out of 6 on the HEART score. </think> However, it seems I might have misunderstood the context. The HEART score is typically used for evaluating chest pain in the context of acute coronary syndrome. Let's use the HEART score criteria for chest pain: The HEART score includes the following components: - H: History - E: ECG - A: Age - R: Risk factors - T: Troponin Let's calculate the HEART score step-by-step for this patient: 1. **History (H):** - The patient has chest pain and palpitations at rest. - He has a history of syncope. - He has been prescribed chlorpheniramine for an upper respiratory tract infection and has been taking propranolol for essential tremor and anxiety disorder. - He is a smoker (smokes up to 20 cigarettes a day). The history component is evaluated based on the characteristics of the chest pain and associated symptoms. Since the patient has chest pain at rest, syncope, and other symptoms like palpitations, this suggests a high-risk history. The history component is scored as follows: - Typical angina: 0 points - Atypical angina: 1 point - Non-anginal chest pain: 2 points - Asymptomatic: 3 points Given the patient's symptoms (chest pain at rest, syncope, and palpitations), the history is likely to be scored as "Non-anginal chest pain" or possibly even higher due to the presence of syncope. Let's score this as 2 points. 2. **ECG (E):** - The ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL. - On the 2nd day, the ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. - On the 3rd day, an upper rib ECG showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The ECG component is scored based on the presence of ischemic changes or other abnormalities. The presence of ST-segment changes (depression and elevation) suggests ischemia or other significant abnormalities. Therefore, the ECG is likely to be scored as abnormal. The scoring for the ECG component is: - Normal: 0 points - Non-diagnostic or indeterminate: 1 point - Ischemic changes: 2 points - Pathological Q waves: 3 points Given the presence of ST-segment changes, the ECG is scored as 2 points. 3. **Age (A):** - The patient is 35 years old. The age component is scored as follows: - < 45 years: 0 points - ≥ 45 years: 1 point Since the patient is 35 years old, the age component is scored as 0 points. 4. **Risk factors (R):** - The patient is a smoker (smokes up to 20 cigarettes a day). - He has a history of essential tremor and anxiety disorder, for which he takes propranolol. - There is no mention of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. The risk factors component is scored based on the presence of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and family history of premature coronary artery disease. The scoring for the risk factors component is: - None: 0 points - One or more: 1 point Since the patient is a smoker, he has at least one risk factor. Therefore, the risk factors component is scored as 1 point. 5. **Troponin (T):** - The patient's biochemical tests did not show any abnormalities, and there is no mention of elevated troponin levels. The troponin component is scored based on the presence of elevated troponin levels: - Normal: 0 points - Elevated: 1 point Since there is no mention of elevated troponin levels, the troponin component is scored as 0 points. Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - History (H): 2 points - ECG (E): 2 points - Age (A): 0 points - Risk factors (R): 1 point - Troponin (T): 0 points Total HEART score = 2 (H) + 2 (E) + 0 (A) + 1 (R) + 0 (T) = 5 points. Therefore, the patient's HEART score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's HEART score, we need to evaluate the following components: History (H), ECG (E), Age (A), Risk factors (R), and Troponin (T). Here's the breakdown: 1. **History (H):** - The patient has chest pain at rest, syncope, and palpitations. This suggests a high-risk history. We score this as 2 points (Non-anginal chest pain). 2. **ECG (E):** - The ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL. On the 2nd day, ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon were observed. On the 3rd day, there was a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. These findings indicate significant ECG abnormalities, so we score this as 2 points (Ischemic changes). 3. **Age (A):** - The patient is 35 years old. Since he is under 45 years old, the age component scores 0 points. 4. **Risk factors (R):** - The patient is a smoker (smokes up to 20 cigarettes a day). Having at least one risk factor (smoking), this component scores 1 point. 5. **Troponin (T):** - There is no mention of elevated troponin levels. Therefore, the troponin component scores 0 points. Adding up the scores: H = 2, E = 2, A = 0, R = 1, T = 0. Total HEART score = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5 points.", "answer": "5"}

", 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the patient's HEART score, I considered the six key components: Hypertension, Electrolytes, Age ≥ 40, Type diabetes Mellitus, Renal Rate, and Type of stroke. The patient does not meet any of these criteria, so his HEART score is 0.", 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '5', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's HEART score, we need to evaluate the following components: History (H), ECG (E), Age (A), Risk factors (R), and Troponin (T). Here's the breakdown: 1. **History (H):** - The patient has chest pain at rest, syncope, and palpitations. This suggests a high-risk history. We score this as 2 points (Non-anginal chest pain). 2. **ECG (E):** - The ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL. On the 2nd day, ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon were observed. On the 3rd day, there was a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. These findings indicate significant ECG abnormalities, so we score this as 2 points (Ischemic changes). 3. **Age (A):** - The patient is 35 years old. Since he is under 45 years old, the age component scores 0 points. 4. **Risk factors (R):** - The patient is a smoker (smokes up to 20 cigarettes a day). Having at least one risk factor (smoking), this component scores 1 point. 5. **Troponin (T):** - There is no mention of elevated troponin levels. Therefore, the troponin component scores 0 points. Adding up the scores: H = 2, E = 2, A = 0, R = 1, T = 0. Total HEART score = 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5 points.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '5', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current HEART Score is 0.\nThe value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Highly suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'history', increasing the current total to 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Significant ST deviation'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', increasing the current total to 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe patient is 35.0 years old. The patient's age is less than 45 years and so keep the current total at 4.\nThe following risk factor(s) are present based on the patient's note: smoking. The following risk factor(s) are mentioned in the patient's note, but these risk factors are noted to be absent from the patient: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family with cvd, atherosclerotic disease. The following risk factor(s) are missing from the patient's data: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family with cvd, atherosclerotic disease. We will assume that these are all absent from the patient. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 1 risk factors are present and so 1 point is added for the risk factors criteria, making the current total, 4 + 1 = 5.\n'initial troponin' is missing from the patient's data and so we assume it's value is less than or equal to normal limit.Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'initial troponin', keeping the current total at 5.\nBased on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 5.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

Therefore, the patient scores 4 out of 5 on the SOFA scale. </think> Let's calculate the SOFA score for each organ system: 1. **Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂ and Mechanical Ventilation):** - The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO₂ of 54% and a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. - Calculate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: $\frac{76}{0.54} \approx 140.74$. - According to the SOFA scoring for the respiratory system: - If the patient is not on mechanical ventilation, the score is based on PaO₂/FiO₂. - If the patient is on mechanical ventilation, the score is based on the FiO₂ and/or PEEP levels. - Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, we use the FiO₂ to determine the score. - The scoring for mechanical ventilation is as follows: - FiO₂ ≤ 0.45: Score 0 - 0.45 < FiO₂ ≤ 0.5: Score 1 - 0.5 < FiO₂ ≤ 0.6: Score 2 - 0.6 < FiO₂ ≤ 0.8: Score 3 - FiO₂ > 0.8: Score 4 - The patient's FiO₂ is 0.54, which falls into the range 0.5 < FiO₂ ≤ 0.6. - Therefore, the respiratory score is 2. 2. **Cardiovascular:** - The patient is receiving multiple vasopressors: norepinephrine and epinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and dobutamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. - According to the SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg: Score 0 - No vasopressors and MAP < 70 mm Hg or dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min: Score 1 - Dopamine ≥ 5 mcg/kg/min or any other vasopressor: Score 2 - Dopamine ≥ 15 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine/epinephrine ≥ 0.1 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent combination: Score 3 - Dopamine ≥ 20 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine/epinephrine ≥ 0.2 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent combination: Score 4 - The patient is receiving: - Norepinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min - Epinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min - Dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min - Dobutamine at 1 mcg/kg/min - Since the patient is receiving both norepinephrine and epinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, this puts him in the category where the use of norepinephrine or epinephrine at ≥ 0.1 mcg/kg/min corresponds to a score. - Norepinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min meets the criterion for a score of 3 or higher. - Therefore, the cardiovascular score is 3 (since the use of norepinephrine or epinephrine at ≥ 0.1 mcg/kg/min corresponds to a score of 3). 3. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Scale):** - The patient has a GCS score of 10. - The scoring for the CNS component is based on the GCS score: - GCS 15: Score 0 - GCS 13-14: Score 1 - GCS 9-12: Score 2 - GCS 4-8: Score 3 - GCS < 4: Score 4 - A GCS of 10 falls into the range GCS 9-12. - Therefore, the CNS score is 2. 4. **Hepatic (Bilirubin):** - The patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL. - The scoring for the hepatic component is based on the bilirubin level: - Bilirubin < 1.2: Score 0 - 1.2 ≤ Bilirubin < 1.7: Score 1 - 1.7 ≤ Bilirubin < 2.6: Score 2 - 2.6 ≤ Bilirubin < 3.4: Score 3 - Bilirubin ≥ 3.4: Score 4 - A bilirubin level of 2.3 mg/dL falls into the range 1.7 ≤ Bilirubin < 2.6. - Therefore, the hepatic score is 2. 5. **Renal (Creatinine or Urine Output):** - The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL. - The scoring for the renal component can be based on either creatinine or urine output. - For creatinine: - Creatinine < 1.2: Score 0 - 1.2 ≤ Creatinine < 1.7: Score 1 - 1.7 ≤ Creatinine < 2.6: Score 2 - 2.6 ≤ Creatinine < 3.4: Score 3 - Creatinine ≥ 3.4: Score 4 - A creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL falls into the range 1.2 ≤ Creatinine < 1.7. - Therefore, the renal score based on creatinine is 1. - For urine output, the scoring is based on the urine output over the last 24 hours: - Urine output ≥ 2000 mL/day: Score 0 - 1000-2000 mL/day: Score 1 - 500-1000 mL/day: Score 2 - 0-500 mL/day: Score 3 - No urine output: Score 4 - The patient's urine output over the past 24 hours is 850 mL/day. - This falls into the range 500-1000 mL/day. - Therefore, the renal score based on urine output is 2. We take the higher score between the two methods (creatinine and urine output). - Creatinine score: 1 - Urine output score: 2 - Therefore, the renal score is 2 (the higher of the two scores). 6. **Hematological (Platelets):** - The patient's platelet count is 175,000/µL. - The scoring for the hematological component is based on the platelet count: - Platelets ≥ 150,000/µL: Score 0 - 100,000-150,000/µL: Score 1 - 50,000-100,000/µL: Score 2 - 20,000-50,000/µL: Score 3 - Platelets < 20,000/µL: Score 4 - A platelet count of 175,000/µL falls into the range ≥ 150,000/µL. - Therefore, the hematological score is 0. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - Respiratory: 2 - Cardiovascular: 3 - CNS: 2 - Hepatic: 2 - Renal: 2 - Hematological: 0 Adding these scores together: $2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 11$.

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic alcohol use, and cirrhosis presented for a routine check. He was sober and although slight mental slowness and mild asterixis were present on exam, There was no evidence of ascites. The laboratory results revealed an INR of 1.9, increasing the concern for impaired liver function. His serum total bilirubin was 2.0 mg/dL and albumin was 3.2 g/dL, indicating diminished liver function. The patient's blood glucose was 120 mg/dL, raising the suspicion of prediabetes, and his creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL, indicating good renal function. He was ordered to abstain from alcohol consumption, maintain a balanced diet, and monitor his blood glucose regularly. His medications including diuretics and antihypertensives remained unaltered until his next appointment.

The Child-Pugh scoring system is as follows: **Parameter** | **Class A** | **Class B** | **Class C** --- | --- | --- | --- Serum Bilirubin (mg/dL) | <2 | 2-3 | >3 Serum Albumin (g/dL) | >3.5 | 2.8-3.5 | <2.8 INR | <1.7 | 1.7-2.3 | >2.3 Ascites | None | Mild | Tense Encephalopathy | None | Grade I-II | Grade III-IV Let's evaluate each parameter for the patient: 1. **Serum Bilirubin**: 2.0 mg/dL - According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: < 2 mg/dL - Class B: 2-3 mg/dL - Class C: > 3 mg/dL - Since the bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL, it falls into Class B. 2. **Serum Albumin**: 3.2 g/dL - According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: > 3.5 g/dL - Class B: 2.8-3.5 g/dL - Class C: < 2.8 g/dL - Since the albumin is 3.2 g/dL, it falls into Class B (because it is between 2.8 and 3.5 g/dL). 3. **INR**: 1.9 - According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: < 1.7 - Class B: 1.7-2.3 - Class C: > 2.3 - Since the INR is 1.9, it falls into Class B (because it is between 1.7 and 2.3). 4. **Ascites**: None - According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: None - Class B: Mild - Class C: Tense - Since there is no evidence of ascites, it falls into Class A. 5. **Encephalopathy**: Mild asterixis is present. - Asterixis can be considered a sign of hepatic encephalopathy. Mild asterixis suggests Grade I-II encephalopathy. - According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: None - Class B: Grade I-II - Class C: Grade III-IV - Since the patient has mild asterixis, which indicates Grade I-II encephalopathy, it falls into Class B. Now we will sum up the points for each class: - Class A = 1 point - Class B = 2 points - Class C = 3 points Let's assign the points based on the classes we determined for each parameter: - Serum Bilirubin: Class B = 2 points - Serum Albumin: Class B = 2 points - INR: Class B = 2 points - Ascites: Class A = 1 point - Encephalopathy: Class B = 2 points Now, we add up these points: \[ 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) + 1 (Ascites) + 2 (Encephalopathy) = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 \] The total Child-Pugh score is 9. To determine the Child-Pugh class, we use the following ranges: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. However, the Child-Pugh score is typically reported as a class (A, B, or C), not just the total points. But the question asks for the score. So the total Child-Pugh score is 9, corresponding to Child-Pugh Class B. Thus, the final Child-Pugh score is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: Serum Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, INR, Ascites, and Encephalopathy. Here are the values from the patient note: - Serum Bilirubin: 2.0 mg/dL - Serum Albumin: 3.2 g/dL - INR: 1.9 - Ascites: None - Encephalopathy: Mild asterixis (indicating Grade I-II encephalopathy). Now, let's classify each parameter according to the Child-Pugh scoring system: 1. **Serum Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - Class A: < 2 mg/dL - Class B: 2-3 mg/dL - Class C: > 3 mg/dL Since the bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL, it falls into Class B. 2. **Serum Albumin (g/dL):** - Class A: > 3.5 g/dL - Class B: 2.8-3.5 g/dL - Class C: < 2.8 g/dL Since the albumin is 3.2 g/dL, it falls into Class B (as it is between 2.8 and 3.5 g/dL). 3. **INR:** - Class A: < 1.7 - Class B: 1.7-2.3 - Class C: > 2.3 Since the INR is 1.9, it falls into Class B (as it is between 1.7 and 2.3). 4. **Ascites:** - Class A: None - Class B: Mild - Class C: Tense Since there is no evidence of ascites, it falls into Class A. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - Class A: None - Class B: Grade I-II - Class C: Grade III-IV Since the patient has mild asterixis, indicating Grade I-II encephalopathy, it falls into Class B. Now, we assign points to each class: - Class A = 1 point - Class B = 2 points - Class C = 3 points So the points for each parameter are: - Serum Bilirubin (Class B) = 2 points - Serum Albumin (Class B) = 2 points - INR (Class B) = 2 points - Ascites (Class A) = 1 point - Encephalopathy (Class B) = 2 points Adding these points together: \[ 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 \] Therefore, the total Child-Pugh score is 9. This corresponds to Child-Pugh Class B since the score range for Class B is 7-9 points.", "answer": "9"}

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

{'Row Number': 97, 'Calculator Name': 'Body Mass Index (BMI)', 'Calculator ID': '6', 'Category': 'physical', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7021465-1', 'Patient Note': 'The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.', 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism includes the following points: 1. Clinical signs of DVT (DVT = deep vein thrombosis) 2. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE 3. Heart rate > 100 bpm 4. Immobilization > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks 5. Previous PE or DVT 6. Hemoptysis 7. Cancer Let's evaluate the given patient note against these criteria: 1. **Clinical signs of DVT**: The note does not mention any clinical signs of DVT such as swelling, pain, or redness in the legs. 2. **Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE**: The patient was admitted due to a chest X-ray showing a mediastinal mass and a CT scan revealing a type B dissection. This suggests that the primary diagnosis is not pulmonary embolism but rather aortic dissection. Therefore, an alternative diagnosis (aortic dissection) is more likely than PE. 3. **Heart rate > 100 bpm**: The note mentions that the resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute. So this criterion is not met. 4. **Immobilization > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks**: There is no mention of recent immobilization or surgery within the last 4 weeks. 5. **Previous PE or DVT**: No information about previous PE or DVT is provided. 6. **Hemoptysis**: No mention of hemoptysis. 7. **Cancer**: No mention of cancer. Since none of the criteria seem to be met based on the information provided, the patient's score on Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is 0. So the final answer is 0. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's score on Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, we need to evaluate the patient against each criterion:\n1.

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh score, let's break it down: The Child-Pugh score is a scoring system used to assess the severity of liver disease in patients with cirrhosis. It considers five key factors: 1. Serum bilirubin level 2. INR (International Normalized Ratio) 3. Ascites 4. Encephalopathy grade 5. Albumin level Here's how the patient scores: 1. Serum bilirubin level: 2.5 mg/dL 2. INR: 1.9 3. Ascites: Present 4. Encephalopathy grade: Grade 1-2 5. Albumin level: 2.8 g/dL Using the Child-Pugh scoring system: * 1 point for each factor: + Bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL + INR > 1.3 + Ascites present + Encephalopathy grade ≥ 2 + Albumin < 3.5 g/dL In this patient: - Bilirubin: 2.5 (1 point) - INR: 1.9 (1 point) - Ascites: Present (1 point) - Encephalopathy: Grade 1-2 (0 points) - Albumin: 2.8 (0 points) Therefore, the patient's Child-Pugh score is: 3 </think> Let's assign the points for each parameter according to the Child-Pugh classification: 1. **Serum Bilirubin:** - < 2 mg/dL: 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL: 2 points - > 3 mg/dL: 3 points The patient's bilirubin level is 2.5 mg/dL, which falls into the range of 2-3 mg/dL. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 2. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** - < 1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - > 2.3: 3 points The patient's INR is 1.9, which falls into the range of 1.7-2.3. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 3. **Ascites:** - None or easily controlled with diuretics: 1 point - Difficult to control: 2 points - Present and refractory to treatment: 3 points The patient has moderate ascites that is noticeable on examination. Since it is present but not specified as being refractory to treatment, we will assume it is "difficult to control." Therefore, it gets 2 points. 4. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 2 points - Grade 2: 3 points - Grade 3 or 4: 4 points The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Since it is between grade 1 and 2, we need to assign the appropriate score. Grade 1 gets 2 points, and Grade 2 gets 3 points. Since the patient has grade 1-2, we'll take the higher score within this range to be conservative, which is Grade 2 (3 points). 5. **Albumin:** - > 3.5 g/dL: 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL: 2 points - < 2.8 g/dL: 3 points The patient's albumin level is 2.8 g/dL. This falls into the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL. Therefore, it gets 2 points. Now, let's add up the points for each parameter: - Serum Bilirubin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 2 points - Encephalopathy: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points Adding these up: 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (INR) + 2 (Ascites) + 3 (Encephalopathy) + 2 (Albumin) = 11 points. To convert this total score into the Child-Pugh class, we use the following classification: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 11 points, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class C. However, the Child-Pugh score is typically expressed as a class rather than a raw score. To find the Child-Pugh score, we sum up the points for each category: - Serum Bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dL falls into the range 2-3 mg/dL, so it gets 2 points. - INR: 1.9 falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. - Ascites: The patient has moderate ascites, which is considered "difficult to control." Therefore, it gets 2 points. - Encephalopathy: The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Since it is between grade 1 and 2, we take the higher score within this range, which is Grade 2 (3 points). - Albumin: 2.8 g/dL falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points. Now, sum up the points: - Bilirubin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 2 points - Encephalopathy: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points Total score = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11 points. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Class A: 5-6 points - Class B: 7-9 points - Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 11, the patient is in Child-Pugh Class C. The Child-Pugh score is typically expressed as a class (A, B, or C), but the total score is 11. So the Child-Pugh score is 11, corresponding to Class C. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters and assign points to each: Serum Bilirubin, INR, Ascites, Encephalopathy, and Albumin. Here are the values from the patient's data:\n\n1. Serum Bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dL\n- The classification for bilirubin is:\n - < 2 mg/dL: 1 point\n - 2-3 mg/dL: 2 points\n - > 3 mg/dL: 3 points\nSince the patient's bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL, it falls into the 2-3 mg/dL range, so it gets 2 points.\n\n2. INR: 1.9\n- The classification for INR is:\n - < 1.7: 1 point\n - 1.7-2.3: 2 points\n - > 2.3: 3 points\nSince the patient's INR is 1.9, it falls into the 1.7-2.3 range, so it gets 2 points.\n\n3. Ascites: Present (moderate ascites)\n- The classification for ascites is:\n - None or easily controlled with diuretics: 1 point\n - Difficult to control: 2 points\n - Present and refractory to treatment: 3 points\nSince the patient has moderate ascites that is present but not specified as being refractory to treatment, we will assign it as "difficult to control," which gives 2 points.\n\n4. Encephalopathy: Grade 1-2\n- The classification for encephalopathy is:\n - None: 1 point\n - Grade 1: 2 points\n - Grade 2: 3 points\n - Grade 3 or 4: 4 points\nSince the patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy, we take the higher score within this range, which is Grade 2 (3 points).\n\n5. Albumin: 2.8 g/dL\n- The classification for albumin is:\n - > 3.5 g/dL: 1 point\n - 2.8-3.5 g/dL: 2 points\n - < 2.8 g/dL: 3 points\nSince the patient's albumin is 2.8 g/dL, it falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points.\n\nNow, we add up the points for each parameter:\n- Serum Bilirubin: 2 points\n- INR: 2 points\n- Ascites: 2 points\n- Encephalopathy: 3 points\n- Albumin: 2 points\n\nTotal score = 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (INR) + 2 (Ascites) + 3 (Encephalopathy) + 2 (Albumin) = 11 points.\n\nAccording to the Child-Pugh classification:\n- Class A: 5-6 points\n- Class B: 7-9 points\n- Class C: 10-15 points\nSince the total score is 11, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class C.", "answer": "11"}

Let's use the points system for the Framingham Risk Score for women. Here are the steps: 1. **Age**: The patient is 67 years old. - For a 67-year-old woman, the points for age are 10. 2. **Total Cholesterol**: The patient's total cholesterol is 196 mg/dL. - For total cholesterol between 190-199 mg/dL, the points are 3. 3. **HDL Cholesterol**: The patient's HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL. - For HDL cholesterol between 50-59 mg/dL, the points are 0. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg. - Since she is on antihypertensive medication, we add the points for systolic BP and the fact that she is on medication. - For systolic BP between 140-149 mm Hg, the points are 2. - Since she is on medication, we add an additional 1 point. - Total points for systolic BP and medication = 2 + 1 = 3. 5. **Smoking Status**: The patient does not smoke. - For non-smokers, the points are 0. Now, let's sum up the points: - Age: 10 points - Total Cholesterol: 3 points - HDL Cholesterol: 0 points - Systolic Blood Pressure + Medication: 3 points - Smoking Status: 0 points Total points = 10 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 16. Using the Framingham Risk Score table for women, we can convert these points into a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease. For a total score of 16: - A score of 16 corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 10-15%. However, the Framingham Risk Score is often presented in terms of points and then converted to a percentage risk using a table or calculator. Let's use the points to find the corresponding risk percentage from the Framingham Risk Score table for women. For a 67-year-old woman with the following characteristics: - Age: 67 (10 points) - Total Cholesterol: 196 mg/dL (3 points) - HDL Cholesterol: 50 mg/dL (0 points) - Systolic BP: 140 mm Hg, on medication (3 points) - Smoking Status: Non-smoker (0 points) Total points = 10 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 16. According to the Framingham Risk Score table for women: - A score of 16 corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 10-15%. Thus, the Framingham Risk Score in terms of points is 16. So the final answer is the points value, which is 16. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to use the points system for the Framingham Risk Score for women.

For non-smokers, the points are 0.\\n\\nNow, let's sum up the points:\\n\\n- Age: 10 points\\n- Total Cholesterol: 3 points\\n- HDL Cholesterol: 0 points\\n- Systolic Blood Pressure + Medication: 3 points\\n- Smoking Status: 0 points\\n\\nTotal points = 10 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 16.\\n\\nUsing the Framingham Risk Score table for women, a total score of 16 corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 10-15%.\\n\\nThus, the Framingham Risk Score in terms of points is 16.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.1', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Female.\nFor females, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 31.764001 * ln(age) + 22.465206 * ln(total_cholestrol) - 1.187731 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 2.552905 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.420251 * bp_medicine + 13.07543 * smoker + -5.060998 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.996945 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker - 146.5933061, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 67 years old. The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

A 70-year-old man presents to the clinic with concerns about recent headaches and breathlessness. His detailed medical history confirms he had suffered a stroke in the past. Additionally, he has been dealing with hypertension for a while now, unfortunately, recent BP measurements reflect a lack of effective control (164/113). The patient denies alcohol consumption, reporting zero drinks per week. There are no predominant signs of renal impairment in his profile, as witnessed by normal creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate. Coagulation profiles including INR have consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes, suggesting no predisposition to bleeding.

The patient has hypertension that is not effectively controlled (BP 164/113), so this is 1 point. - A (Age ≥ 65 years): The patient is 70 years old, which is over 65, so this is 1 point. - S (Stroke): The patient has a history of stroke, so this is 1 point. - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): The patient has no significant bleeding episodes, so this is 0 points. - L (Lab results: Liver function): No mention of liver impairment, so this is 0 points. - E (Lab results: Renal function): No signs of renal impairment (normal creatinine and GFR), so this is 0 points. - D (Drugs: Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids): No mention of such medications, so this is 0 points. Now let's sum up the points based on the HAS-BLED criteria: - H (Hypertension): 1 point (since the patient has hypertension) - A (Age ≥ 65 years): 1 point (since the patient is 70 years old) - S (Stroke): 1 point (since the patient has a history of stroke) - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 points (no significant bleeding episodes) - L (Lab results: Liver function): 0 points (no mention of liver impairment) - E (Lab results: Renal function): 0 points (normal creatinine and GFR) - D (Drugs: Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk): 0 points (no mention of such medications) Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 1 (S) + 0 (B) + 0 (L) + 0 (E) + 0 (D) = 3 points.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L, we need to understand what a delta gap is. The delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the normal anion gap value. The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mEq/L. The anion gap can be calculated using the following equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) In this patient: * Sodium: 135 mmol/L * Chloride: 110 mmol/L * Bicarbonate: 18 mmol/L Plugging these values into the equation: Anion Gap = 135 - (110 + 18) Anion Gap = 135 - 128 Anion Gap = 7 Now, to calculate the albumin delta gap: Albumin delta gap = Anion Gap - Normal anion gap = 7 - 12 = -5 </step_by_step_thinking> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's albumin corrected delta gap, we plug the patient's values into the equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate), which equals 7.

Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

<think> To calculate the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L, we need to understand what a delta gap is. The delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the normal anion gap value. The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mEq/L. The anion gap can be calculated using the following equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) In this patient: * Sodium: 135 mmol/L * Chloride: 110 mmol/L * Bicarbonate: 18 mmol/L Plugging these values into the equation: Anion Gap = 135 - (110 + 18) Anion Gap = 135 - 128 Anion Gap = 7 Now, to calculate the albumin delta gap: Albumin delta gap = Anion Gap - Normal anion gap = 7 - 12 = -5 </step_by_step_thinking> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's albumin corrected delta gap, we plug the patient's values into the equation: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate), which equals 7.

It seems like there might be some confusion. The term "albumin-corrected anion gap" is sometimes used to adjust the anion gap for hypoalbuminemia. The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: Corrected Anion Gap = Measured Anion Gap + 2.5 * (4 - Serum Albumin) Let's use the given values to calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap. From the patient's data: - Sodium = 135 mmol/L - Chloride = 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate = 18 mmol/L - Albumin = 1.2 g/dL First, calculate the measured anion gap: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) Anion Gap = 135 - (110 + 18) Anion Gap = 135 - 128 Anion Gap = 7 mEq/L Now, we will use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap: Corrected Anion Gap = Measured Anion Gap + 2.5 * (4 - Serum Albumin) Plugging in the values: Corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2) Corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 2.5 * (2.8) Corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 7 Corrected Anion Gap = 14 mEq/L Now, to find the albumin-corrected delta gap, we subtract the normal anion gap (typically 12 mEq/L) from the corrected anion gap: Albumin-corrected Delta Gap = Corrected Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap Albumin-corrected Delta Gap = 14 - 12 Albumin-corrected Delta Gap = 2 mEq/L So the patient's albumin-corrected delta gap is 2 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we first need to calculate the measured anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

Type of stroke: The patient presented with altered mental status initially, which can be classified as a type of stroke. Therefore, the patient scores 4 out of 6 on the HEART score. </think> However, it seems I might have misunderstood the context. The HEART score is typically used for evaluating chest pain and is composed of different components: History, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Let's calculate the HEART score for the patient based on the information provided for his presentation with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The HEART score components are: 1. **History**: This involves the characteristics of the chest pain. 2. **ECG**: The presence of ECG changes. 3. **Age**: The patient's age. 4. **Risk factors**: Presence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. 5. **Troponin**: The level of troponin. Let's evaluate each component step-by-step: 1. **History**: The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is sharp and worsens with deep breaths, which is not typical for cardiac chest pain. Therefore, the history component is likely to be low risk. 2. **ECG**: The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. This suggests no significant acute ischemic changes. Therefore, the ECG component is likely to be low risk. 3. **Age**: The patient is 47 years old. Age is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Since the patient is 47, this puts him in the moderate risk category for age. 4. **Risk factors**: The patient has several risk factors for coronary artery disease, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These are significant risk factors. 5. **Troponin**: The initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (which is elevated), but it subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml. Elevated troponin initially suggests some myocardial injury, but the downtrend indicates that the injury may not be ongoing or acute. Now let's assign scores to each component based on the HEART score criteria: - **History**: Pleuritic chest pain is not typical for cardiac chest pain. This would typically score low risk. Let's assign it a score of 0 or 1. - **ECG**: No significant ischemic changes. This would typically score low risk. Let's assign it a score of 0 or 1. - **Age**: The patient is 47 years old. According to the HEART score, age 45-54 years typically scores 1 point. - **Risk factors**: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Both are significant risk factors. Typically, having at least one risk factor scores 1 point, and having multiple risk factors might increase the score. Let's assign it a score of 1 or 2. - **Troponin**: The initial troponin was elevated (0.481 ng/ml), which is above the normal range, but it subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml. Elevated troponin initially suggests some myocardial injury. Typically, an elevated troponin scores 1 or 2 points depending on the level. Since it downtrended, it suggests that the injury may not be ongoing. Let's assign it a score of 1. Now let's sum up the scores: - History: 1 (pleuritic chest pain is not typical for cardiac chest pain, but it's associated with shortness of breath, so it's somewhat concerning) - ECG: 0 (no significant ischemic changes) - Age: 1 (47 years old, within the 45-54 age range) - Risk factors: 2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension) - Troponin: 1 (initially elevated, then downtrended) Adding these up: 1 (History) + 0 (ECG) + 1 (Age) + 2 (Risk factors) + 1 (Troponin) = 5. Therefore, the patient's HEART score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's HEART score for his presentation with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, we evaluate the following components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin.\n\n1. **History**: The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath.

Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.', 'Question': "What is the patient's HEART score?", 'LLM Model': '/medcalc-llama-3-3b-inst-grpo', 'LLM Answer': '4', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the patient's HEART score, which stands for Hypertension, Electrolytes, Age ≥ 40, Type diabetes Mellitus, Renal Rate, and Type of stroke, let's break it down: 1.

Electrolytes: There is no mention of abnormal electrolyte levels in the patient's presentation. 3. Age ≥ 40: The patient is 47 years old, so this criterion is met. 4. Type diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. 5. Renal Rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min. 6.

Pleuritic chest pain is not typical for cardiac chest pain, so this component is likely low risk. Let's assign it a score of 1.\\n\\n2. **ECG**: The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. This suggests no significant acute ischemic changes. Therefore, the ECG component is likely to be low risk. Let's assign it a score of 0.\\n\\n3. **Age**: The patient is 47 years old. According to the HEART score, age 45-54 years typically scores 1 point. So, the score for Age is 1.\\n\\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Both are significant risk factors. Typically, having at least one risk factor scores 1 point, and having multiple risk factors might increase the score.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between October 1, 2022, and June 13, 2023. - From October 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022: 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days (since October has 31 days, and we start counting from October 1). - November 2022 has 30 days. - December 2022 has 31 days. - January 2023 has 31 days. - February 2023 has 28 days (since 2023 is not a leap year). - March 2023 has 31 days. - April 2023 has 30 days. - May 2023 has 31 days. - And from June 1 to June 13, 2023: 13 days. Now, let's add up all these days: - October 2022: 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days (from October 1 to October 31) - November 2022: 30 days - December 2022: 31 days - January 2023: 31 days - February 2023: 28 days - March 2023: 31 days - April 2023: 30 days - May 2023: 31 days - June 2023: 13 days (from June 1 to June 13) Adding these together: \[ 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 13 (June) \] Let's sum them step by step: \[ 31 + 30 = 61 \] \[ 61 + 31 = 92 \] \[ 92 + 31 = 123 \] \[ 123 + 28 = 151 \] \[ 151 + 31 = 182 \] \[ 182 + 30 = 212 \] \[ 212 + 31 = 243 \] \[ 243 + 13 = 256 \] So, the total number of days between October 1, 2022, and June 13, 2023, is 256 days. Now, we convert 256 days into weeks and days. Since there are 7 days in a week: \[ 256 \div 7 = 36 \text{ weeks and a remainder of } 256 - (36 \times 7) = 256 - 252 = 4 \text{ days.} \] Therefore, the gestational age is 36 weeks and 4 days.
