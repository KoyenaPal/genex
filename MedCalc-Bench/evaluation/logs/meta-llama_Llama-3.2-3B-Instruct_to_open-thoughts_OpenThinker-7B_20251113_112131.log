 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

THINKING USED  To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we need to evaluate the patient's history for the following bleeding risk factors: - Hypertension - Altered mental status - Bleeding history or bleeding tendency - Labile INR - Gastrointestinal bleeding - Exsanguination or surgical bleeding - Local or intraocular bleeding - Neurological disorder <step1> The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step2> There is no mention of altered mental status, so we will not add any points for this category. <step3> The patient has a history of liver disease (ALD), which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step4> There is no mention of a bleeding history or bleeding tendency, so we will not add any points for this category. <step5> The patient's INR is consistently normal, which means he is not at risk for labile INR. So, we will not add any points for this category. <step6> There is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step7> There is no mention of exsanguination or surgical bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step8> There is no mention of local or intraocular bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step9> The patient has a history of neurological disorder (renal impairment), which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step10> Now, let's add up the points: 1 (hypertension) + 1 (liver disease) + 1 (renal impairment) = 3 points. <step11> The maximum HAS-BLED score is 9. Since the patient has 3 points, his HAS-BLED score is 3. <step12> Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

THINKING USED Step 1: Identify the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 2: Determine the patient's cholesterol levels. The patient's LDL is 107 mg/dL, HDL is 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 98 mg/dL. These values are not ideal, but they are not high enough to be considered significantly elevated. Step 3: Assess the patient's blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure is 131/83 mm Hg, which is slightly elevated but not significantly high. Step 4: Evaluate the patient's age and sex. The patient is a 50-year-old male, which puts him in a higher risk category for cardiovascular disease. Step 5: Consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of acute diverticulitis, which may be related to his smoking history, but it is not a direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 6: Calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score. The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following formula: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x age) + (0.1 x sex) + (0.1 x cholesterol) + (0.1 x blood pressure) + (0.1 x diabetes) + (0.1 x heart disease) + (0.1 x stroke) + (0.1 x peripheral artery disease) Since the patient does not have diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or peripheral artery disease, the formula simplifies to: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x age) + (0.1 x sex) + (0.1 x cholesterol) + (0.1 x blood pressure) Step 7: Plug in the patient's values into the formula. Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x 50) + (0.1 x 1) + (0.1 x 107) + (0.1 x 131) Framingham Risk Score = 10 - 5 + 1 + 10.7 + 13.1 Framingham Risk Score = 31.8

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia. On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam. The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques (). A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative. Here is the task: What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?

The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 2: Determine the patient's cholesterol levels. The patient's LDL is 107 mg/dL, HDL is 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 98 mg/dL. These values are not ideal, but they are not high enough to be considered significantly elevated. Step 3: Assess the patient's blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure is 131/83 mm Hg, which is slightly elevated but not significantly high. Step 4: Evaluate the patient's age and sex. The patient is a 50-year-old male, which puts him in a higher risk category for cardiovascular disease. Step 5: Consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of acute diverticulitis, which may be related to his smoking history, but it is not a direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 6: Calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score. The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following formula: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x age) + (0.1 x sex) + (0.1 x cholesterol) + (0.1 x blood pressure) + (0.1 x diabetes) + (0.1 x heart disease) + (0.1 x stroke) + (0.1 x peripheral artery disease) Since the patient does not have diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or peripheral artery disease, the formula simplifies to: Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x age) + (0.1 x sex) + (0.1 x cholesterol) + (0.1 x blood pressure) Step 7: Plug in the patient's values into the formula. Framingham Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x 50) + (0.1 x 1) + (0.1 x 107) + (0.1 x 131) Framingham Risk Score = 10 - 5 + 1 + 10.7 + 13.1 Framingham Risk Score = 31.8 <|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|>{"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we first identify all relevant risk factors.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male with a history of liver failure and immunocompromise presents to the emergency department with acute symptoms of lethargy and decreased appetite. Physical examination reveals tachycardia to 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, blood pressure registering at 135/75 mm Hg and a baseline temperature of 37.2°C. Neurological assessment demonstrates mild confusion, corresponding to a Glasgow Coma Score of 14. Blood tests reveal elevated creatinine levels at 3.8 mg/dL. Metabolic panel showed sodium at 138 and potassium at 4.5 mEq/L. The white blood cell count was 12,000 per µL, triggering concern for a possible infection. Hematocrit was just within normal range at 43 %. The patient had an arterial blood gas pH of 7.32 and a A-a-gradient of 364, with a supplementary FiO₂ of 55 %. This patient's acute renal failure symptomatology, alongside the history of severe organ failure and immunocompromised, mandate rigorous monitoring and urgent medical intervention.

THINKING USED  To calculate the APACHE II score, we need to assign points for each of the following categories: age, temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, arterial pH, serum sodium, serum potassium, creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). 1. Age: The patient is 60 years old, so we assign 3 points for age 60-69. 2. Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C, which is normal, so we assign 0 points for temperature. 3. Mean arterial pressure: The patient's blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for mean arterial pressure. 4. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is 95 beats per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for heart rate. 5. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for respiratory rate. 6. Oxygenation: The patient's arterial blood gas pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, and the A-a-gradient is 364, which indicates severe hypoxemia. We assign 4 points for oxygenation. 7. Arterial pH: The patient's arterial pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, so we assign 2 points for arterial pH. 8. Serum sodium: The patient's serum sodium is 138 mEq/L, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for serum sodium. 9. Serum potassium: The patient's serum potassium is 4.5 mEq/L, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for serum potassium. 10. Creatinine: The patient's creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL, which indicates acute renal failure, so we assign 6 points for creatinine. 11. Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is 43%, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for hematocrit. 12. White blood cell count: The patient's white blood cell count is 12,000/µL, which indicates leukocytosis, so we assign 2 points for white blood cell count. 13. Glasgow Coma Score: The patient's GCS is 14, which indicates mild confusion, so we assign 3 points for GCS. Now, let's add up the points: 3 (age) + 0 (temperature) + 0 (mean arterial pressure) + 2 (heart rate) + 2 (respiratory rate) + 4 (oxygenation) + 2 (arterial pH) + 2 (serum potassium) + 6 (creatinine) + 0 (hematocrit) + 2 (white blood cell count) + 3 (GCS) = 26 The APACHE II score is 26.

The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative. Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 55.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 364. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 135.0 mm Hg = 95.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 95.0 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 8 = 18.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 18.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly. It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney. A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease. On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity. The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign scores based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, which assesses pain, fever, and inflammation. The FeverPAIN score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. 1. Pain: The patient reported abdominal pain and sore mouth, but the endoscopy confirmed only moderate to severe distal esophagitis and pangastritis. Based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, we can assign a score of 4 for pain. 2. Fever: The patient's temperature is not mentioned in the note, but the patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 18.9 × 10^3 K/mm^3, indicating an inflammatory response. However, the FeverPAIN scoring system does not have a specific score for leukocyte count. We will assume a score of 2 for fever based on the elevated leukocyte count. 3. Inflammation: The patient's gastric biopsy demonstrated acute inflammation and epithelial erosion, which indicates significant inflammation. Based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, we can assign a score of 6 for inflammation. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score by adding the scores for pain, fever, and inflammation: FeverPAIN score = Pain score + Fever score + Inflammation score = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 However, the FeverPAIN score should not exceed 10. Since the patient's symptoms are severe, we will adjust the scores to reflect the maximum possible score. Adjusted FeverPAIN score = 10

Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().\nGiven the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.', 'Question': "What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '10', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign scores based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, which assesses pain, fever, and inflammation. The FeverPAIN score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. 1. Pain: The patient reported abdominal pain and sore mouth, but the endoscopy confirmed only moderate to severe distal esophagitis and pangastritis. Based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, we can assign a score of 4 for pain. 2. Fever: The patient's temperature is not mentioned in the note, but the patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 18.9 × 10^3 K/mm^3, indicating an inflammatory response. However, the FeverPAIN scoring system does not have a specific score for leukocyte count. We will assume a score of 2 for fever based on the elevated leukocyte count. 3. Inflammation: The patient's gastric biopsy demonstrated acute inflammation and epithelial erosion, which indicates significant inflammation. Based on the FeverPAIN scoring system, we can assign a score of 6 for inflammation. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score by adding the scores for pain, fever, and inflammation: FeverPAIN score = Pain score + Fever score + Inflammation score = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 However, the FeverPAIN score should not exceed 10. Since the patient's symptoms are severe, we will adjust the scores to reflect the maximum possible score. Adjusted FeverPAIN score = 10 ", 'LLM Explanation': 'To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we assigned scores for pain (4), assumed a score for fever (2) based on the elevated leukocyte count, and inflammation (6) based on the gastric biopsy results. The adjusted FeverPAIN score is 10 due to the maximum possible score for each category.', 'Target Model': 'open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B', 'Target Answer': '10', 'Target Explanation': "To determine the FeverPAIN score, we analyzed the patient's symptoms related to pain, fever, and inflammation. Pain was scored at 4 (moderate to severe esophagitis and gastritis), fever at 2 (elevated WBC count), and inflammation at 6 (acute inflammation and erosion). Summing these gives 12, but since the maximum is 10, we cap it at 10.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '1', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's current FeverPain score is 0.\nWhether the patient has a fever in the past 24 hours is not reported and so we assume that it is absent for the patient. Because of this, we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 0.\n'The patient is reported to have an absence of cough or coryza and so we increment the score by 1, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nWhether the patient has a symptom onset ≤3 days is not reported and so we assume that it is absent for the patient. Because of this, we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient is reported to not have purulent tonsils and so we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient is reported to not have severe tonsil inflammation and so we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient's FeverPain score is 1 points.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

THINKING USED  To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, we need to follow these steps: 1. First, we need to convert the patient's heart rate from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bps). We can do this by dividing the heart rate by 60. 2. Next, we need to plug the values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR) * 1000, where QT is the patient's uncorrected QT interval in milliseconds, and RR is the patient's heart rate in seconds. 3. Now, we can plug in the values: QTc = 330 / sqrt(46/60) * 1000. 4. Calculate the square root of 46/60: sqrt(46/60) = sqrt(0.7667) = 0.875. 5. Now, multiply the uncorrected QT interval by the result: 330 * 0.875 = 289.25. 6. Finally, multiply the result by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds: 289.25 * 1000 = 289250.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

The note mentions HbA1c of 10.7%, which isn't directly usable. Instead, look for FG and insulin levels. The note states that after initiating Exenatide, her FG improved to 163 mg/dL. However, the insulin level isn't explicitly provided. Wait, the note does mention insulin levels: 'insulin (−26uIU/ml)' at 6 months. This indicates a decrease of 26 uIU/mL from baseline. Assuming the baseline insulin before starting Exenatide was higher, but the exact value isn't given. However, the problem might require using the most recent insulin measurement before surgery. The note says HbA1c was 5.8% on day of surgery, and weight was 118.9kg. But insulin levels at that time aren't mentioned. Rechecking the note: At initial preoperative evaluation, insulin wasn't listed. Later, after 6 months, insulin was -26 uIU/mL compared to baseline. If the baseline insulin was, say, 52 uIU/mL (since it decreased by 26), but this is an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the note provides the current insulin level at the time of surgery. The note says 'insulin (−26uIU/ml)' at 6 months. If the patient's insulin level at 6 months was 26 uIU/mL lower than baseline, but without knowing baseline, we can't compute HOMA-IR. Wait, maybe I missed the insulin value. Let me check again. The note says: "After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl)." So, the insulin level at 6 months was 26 uIU/mL less than baseline. But without knowing the baseline insulin, we can't compute HOMA-IR. However, perhaps the note provides the current insulin level at the time of surgery. The note ends with: "HbA1c 5.8% and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively." There's no mention of insulin here. The only insulin value given is the decrease of 26 uIU/mL from baseline. Since the problem requires calculating HOMA-IR, and assuming that the most recent insulin measurement available is the one at 6 months (26 uIU/mL lower than baseline), but without knowing baseline, this approach is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the note includes the insulin level at the time of surgery. Let me re-examine the note: The last entry is "HbA1c 5.8% and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively." No insulin data here. The previous entry mentions "insulin (−26uIU/ml)" at 6 months. If the baseline insulin was, for example, 52 uIU/mL (since it decreased by 26), then the current insulin would be 26. But this is speculative. However, the problem might expect using the insulin value from the latest available data before surgery. Alternatively, perhaps the note provides the insulin level at the time of surgery. Since it's not mentioned, perhaps the answer expects using the insulin value from the 6-month mark. Assuming that the insulin level at 6 months was 26 uIU/mL (a decrease of 26 from baseline), but without knowing baseline, this is impossible. Wait, maybe the note has a typo or missing data. Alternatively, perhaps the insulin level at the time of surgery is needed. The note says "Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively." There's no insulin data here. The only insulin value is the decrease of 26 uIU/mL from baseline. Without knowing the baseline insulin, we cannot compute HOMA-IR. This suggests either missing data in the note or an error in the problem setup. However, given the information provided, perhaps the intended approach is to use the insulin value from the 6-month mark. If the baseline insulin was, say, 52 uIU/mL (since it decreased by 26), then the current insulin is 26. Then, using FG of 163 mg/dL (from the 6-month mark), HOMA-IR would be (26 * 163)/(163^2) = (4238)/(265969) ≈ 0.0159. But this is an assumption. Alternatively, if the insulin level at the time of surgery is needed, but it's not provided. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to state that insufficient data is provided to calculate HOMA-IR. However, the problem likely expects using the insulin value from the 6-month mark. Therefore, assuming the insulin level at 6 months is 26 uIU/mL, and FG is 163 mg/dL, HOMA-IR is approximately 0.0159. But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the note provides the insulin level at the time of surgery. Since it's not mentioned, perhaps the answer is that there's insufficient data. However, given the context, the expected answer might be 0.0159. But I need to verify. Wait, the note says: "After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl)." So, the insulin level at 6 months was 26 uIU/mL less than baseline. If the baseline insulin was, say, 52 uIU/mL, then current is 26. Using FG of 163 mg/dL, HOMA-IR is (26 * 163)/(163^2) = 0.0159. But without knowing baseline, this is an assumption. However, the problem might have intended to provide the insulin level at the time of surgery. Since it's not given, perhaps the answer is that there's insufficient data. But given the options, the most reasonable assumption is that the insulin level at 6 months is 26 uIU/mL, leading to HOMA-IR ≈ 0.0159. However, another possibility is that the insulin level at the time of surgery is needed. Since the note doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is that the data is incomplete. But given the problem's context, the expected answer is likely 0.0159. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.016. But let's check the exact calculation. If insulin is 26 uIU/mL and FG is 163 mg/dL, then HOMA-IR = (26 * 163)/(163^2) = 26/163 ≈ 0.16. Wait, wait, no: HOMA-IR formula is (F * I)/4.58. Wait, no, the formula is (F * I)/4.58. Wait, no, the original formula is HOMA-IR = (Fasting Glucose (mg/dL) × Insulin (μU/mL)) / 4.57. So, using the values: F = 163 mg/dL, I = 26 μU/mL. Then HOMA-IR = (163 * 26)/4.57 ≈ (4238)/4.57 ≈ 926. So that can't be right. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, the formula is (F * I) divided by 4.57. So 163 * 26 = 4238. 4238 / 4.57 ≈ 926. That's way too high. Clearly, this can't be correct. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong. Where did I go wrong? Oh! The formula is (F * I)/4.57, but F must be in mmol/L and I in mU/L. Wait, no, the standard formula uses F in mmol/L and I in mU/L. So, first convert FG from mg/dL to mmol/L: 163 mg/dL = 163/18 = 9.0556 mmol/L. Insulin is already in mU/L: 26 mU/L. Then HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ (235.446)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. Still high. But this is still not matching typical HOMA-IR values. Typical HOMA-IR values range from 0.5 to 2.0. So clearly, something is wrong here. This suggests that the insulin value provided is not the current insulin level but a change from baseline. The note says "insulin (−26uIU/ml)" at 6 months, indicating a decrease of 26 uIU/mL from baseline. If the baseline insulin was, say, 52 uIU/mL (since it decreased by 26), then the current insulin is 26. But even then, using the conversion to mmol/L: 163 mg/dL = 9.0556 mmol/L. HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. Still too high. This implies that either the insulin value is incorrect, or the FG is not the most recent value. Alternatively, perhaps the insulin level at the time of surgery is needed. The note mentions HbA1c 5.8% and weight 118.9kg at 2 months postoperatively. If insulin levels normalized, perhaps it's around 5-10 mU/L. Let's assume insulin is 5 mU/L. Then HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 5)/4.57 ≈ 45.28/4.57 ≈ 9.9. Still high. This suggests that either the note is missing critical data, or there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Another possibility: The note mentions "insulin (−26uIU/ml)" at 6 months. If the baseline insulin was 52, current is 26. But even so, the HOMA-IR would be (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. This is unreasonably high. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach. Perhaps the insulin value provided is not the current level but the baseline. For example, if the baseline insulin was 52 uIU/mL, and it decreased by 26 to 26, then using the latest FG of 163 mg/dL, HOMA-IR is (163 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. Still high. Alternatively, maybe the insulin level at the time of surgery is needed. Since the note doesn't provide it, perhaps the answer is that insufficient data is available. However, given the problem's context, the expected answer is likely 0.0159, but this seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the insulin level at the time of surgery is 5 mU/L, leading to HOMA-IR ≈ 9.9. But this is speculative. Given the ambiguity, the most prudent conclusion is that the necessary data (current insulin level) is missing, making it impossible to calculate HOMA-IR accurately. However, since the problem asks for a solution, perhaps the intended answer assumes using the insulin value from the 6-month mark. Therefore, proceeding with that assumption: Insulin = 26 uIU/mL, FG = 163 mg/dL. Convert FG to mmol/L: 163/18 = 9.0556. HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. This is extremely high, which is biologically implausible. Hence, there must be an error in the note or the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the insulin level is in mU/L and the formula uses different units. Wait, the formula is (F * I)/4.57 where F is in mmol/L and I in mU/L. If the insulin is 26 mU/L, then yes. But even so, the result is 51.4. This suggests that either the insulin value is incorrect, or the FG is not the most recent. Given the problem's constraints, the answer must be based on the data provided. Therefore, despite the high value, the answer is approximately 51.4. However, this seems unrealistic. Another possibility: The note mentions "insulin (−26uIU/ml)" at 6 months, implying that the baseline insulin was 26 + 26 = 52 uIU/mL. If the current insulin is 52, then HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 52)/4.57 ≈ 474.87/4.57 ≈ 103.7. Still very high. This suggests that the insulin value provided is not the current level but a change from baseline. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the most recent insulin measurement available. The note says "insulin (−26uIU/ml)" at 6 months, meaning the current insulin is 26 uIU/mL. Using this, HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. However, this is unreasonably high. Given the problem's context, perhaps the intended answer is 0.0159, but this requires converting the insulin to mmol/L. Wait, insulin is already in mU/L. Let me double-check the formula: HOMA-IR = (F * I)/4.57, where F is in mmol/L and I in mU/L. So if F is 9.0556 mmol/L and I is 26 mU/L, then HOMA-IR = (9.0556 * 26)/4.57 ≈ 51.4. This is still high. Therefore, the conclusion is that the data provided is insufficient to calculate HOMA-IR accurately. However, given the problem's requirements, the expected answer is likely 0.0159, but this is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the insulin level at the time of surgery is 5 mU/L, leading to HOMA-IR ≈ 9.9. But without explicit data, this is guesswork. Given the ambiguity, the best possible answer is that there's insufficient data. However, since the problem expects a numerical answer, the most plausible assumption is that the insulin level at 6 months is 26 mU/L, leading to HOMA-IR ≈ 51.4. But this is highly unlikely. Therefore, the correct answer is that the data is insufficient. However, given the problem's context, the intended answer is probably 0.0159, but this requires converting the insulin to mmol/L. Wait, insulin is already in mU/L. Let me recalculate with the correct formula. HOMA-IR = (F * I)/4.57. F is 163 mg/dL = 9.0556 mmol/L. I is 26 mU/L. So 9.0556 * 26 = 235.446. Divided by 4.57 gives 51.4. This is way too high. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the note is missing critical data. However, since the problem asks for a solution, perhaps the intended answer is 0.0159, but this is incorrect. Alternatively, the insulin level at the time of surgery is 5 mU/L, leading to HOMA-IR ≈ 9.9. But without explicit data, this is a guess.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

THINKING USED  To find the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L, we need to first find the patient's sodium concentration in terms of mg/dL and then convert it to mEq/L. The patient's sodium concentration was 136 mmol/L, which is equivalent to 136 mg/dL. To convert mg/dL to mEq/L, we need to divide the value in mg/dL by 39 (since 1 mEq = 39 mg). So, the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L is 136 mg/dL / 39 = 3.46 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Here is the task:

THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the patient's medical history and current condition The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She was recently diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the right great toe and underwent surgery, followed by amputation of the toe. She was also started on nafcillin, which was discontinued due to suspected drug-related hepatic injury. Step 2: Identify the relevant laboratory values The patient's laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. These values indicate liver damage and cholestasis. Step 3: Analyze the patient's liver function tests The patient's liver function tests show a range of abnormal values, including elevated AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. These values suggest liver damage and cholestasis. Step 4: Determine the patient's delta ratio The delta ratio is not explicitly defined in the provided text. However, based on the context, it is likely that the delta ratio refers to the difference between the patient's current liver function tests and her baseline values. To calculate the delta ratio, we need to compare the patient's current values to her baseline values. Step 5: Calculate the delta ratio To calculate the delta ratio, we need to compare the patient's current values to her baseline values. However, the baseline values are not explicitly provided. We can assume that the baseline values are the values from the patient's initial laboratory evaluation, which were: * AST: 8 IU/L * ALT: 9 IU/L * ALP: 78 IU/L * GGTP: 878 IU/L * Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL Using these values, we can calculate the delta ratio as follows: * AST: 152 IU/L - 8 IU/L = 144 IU/L * ALT: 85 IU/L - 9 IU/L = 76 IU/L * ALP: 1800 IU/L - 78 IU/L = 1722 IU/L * GGTP: 1500 IU/L - 878 IU/L = 622 IU/L * Bilirubin: 11.5 mg/dL - 0.3 mg/dL = 11.2 mg/dL The delta ratio is a measure of the change in liver function tests over time. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect any changes in liver function. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's delta ratio is calculated by comparing the current values to the baseline values.

Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of 6 months of progressive fatigue and weight loss. His mother reports that during this time, he has had decreased energy and has become a “picky eater.” He often has loose stools and complains of occasional abdominal pain and nausea. His family moved to a different house 7 months ago. He is at the 50th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 116/min, and blood pressure is 85/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows tanned skin and bluish-black gums. The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender. Serum studies show:
Na+ 134 mEq/L
K+ 5.4 mEq/L
Cl- 104 mEq/L
Bicarbonate 21 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL

THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the given information The patient's sodium concentration is given as 134 mEq/L, and we need to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. Step 2: Identify the relevant laboratory value The relevant laboratory value is the patient's sodium concentration, which is 134 mEq/L. Step 3: Determine the correction factor Since the patient is experiencing hyponatremia (low sodium levels), we need to correct the sodium concentration. However, the correction factor is not explicitly provided in the given information. Step 4: Consider possible correction methods There are two common methods to correct sodium concentration: the "1% rule" and the "1/3 rule". The "1% rule" states that for every 1% decrease in sodium concentration, the dose of free water should be 0.5 mL/kg. The "1/3 rule" states that for every 1 mEq/L decrease in sodium concentration, the dose of free water should be 0.33 mL/kg. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate correction method Since the patient is experiencing hyponatremia, we will use the "1/3 rule" to correct the sodium concentration. Step 6: Calculate the correction amount The patient's sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L, which is 8 mEq/L below the normal range (140 mEq/L). Using the "1/3 rule", the correction amount would be 8 mEq/L x 0.33 mL/kg = 2.64 mL/kg. Step 7: Calculate the total correction amount Since the patient's weight is not explicitly provided, we cannot calculate the exact correction amount. However, we can express the correction amount in terms of the patient's weight. Step 8: Express the corrected sodium concentration The corrected sodium concentration can be expressed as 134 mEq/L + 2.64 mL/kg x (weight in kg) / 1000 mL.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

THINKING USED  To calculate the albumin corrected anion gap, we need to first calculate the uncorrected anion gap and then subtract the albumin level from it. The uncorrected anion gap can be calculated using the formula: uncorrected anion gap = (sodium + chloride) - (chloride + bicarbonate) Given values: - Sodium: 139 mEq/L - Chloride: 102 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 30 mEq/L uncorrected anion gap = (139 + 102) - (102 + 30) uncorrected anion gap = 241 - 132 uncorrected anion gap = 109 mEq/L Next, we need to calculate the albumin corrected anion gap using the formula: uncorrected anion gap (albumin corrected) = uncorrected anion gap - albumin Given albumin level: 1.5 g/dL uncorrected anion gap (albumin corrected) = 109 - 1.5 uncorrected anion gap (albumin corrected) = 107.5 mEq/L

A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. <|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> {"step_by_step_thinking": "First, identify the last menstrual period (LMP) date: 02/03/2012. Add 7 days to this date: 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 09/03/2012. Then add the cycle length of 28 days: 09/03/2012 + 28 days = 07/04/2012. Wait, but wait—Naegele's Rule typically adds 7 days to LMP and then 9 months. Let me check again. The formula is: Due Date = LMP + 7 days + 9 months. So starting with 02/03/2012, adding 7 days brings us to 09/03/2012. Adding 9 months would take us to November 2012. Then add 14 days (since 9 months is approximately 266 days, which is about 38 weeks). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. Naegele's Rule: Take the first day of the last menstrual period, add 7 days, and add 9 months. So 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 09/03/2012. Then add 9 months: 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days (since 9 months is roughly 266 days, which is 38 weeks, so 266 - 28 = 238 days, but perhaps better to add 14 days after 9 months). Alternatively, adding 7 days to LMP gives 09/03/2012, then adding 9 months (November 2012) and 14 days. So 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days: 07/03/2013 + 14 days = 21/03/2013. But wait, another way: Adding 7 days to LMP (02/03/2012) gives 09/03/2012. Then add 9 months: 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days: 07/03/2013 + 14 days = 21/03/2013. However, some sources say that Naegele's Rule is simply adding 7 days to LMP and then 9 months. So if LMP is 02/03/2012, adding 7 days is 09/03/2012. Adding 9 months would be 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Therefore, the estimated due date is March 7, 2013. But let me confirm with another approach. Another method: Start with the LMP date. If the cycle is 28 days, the ovulation is around day 14. So conception occurs around 14 days after LMP. Adding 40 weeks (280 days) to the ovulation date would give the due date. Ovulation is 14 days after LMP: 02/03/2012 + 14 days = 16/03/2012. Adding 280 days to 16/03/2012: 16/03/2012 + 280 days. Let's calculate 280 days. 365 - 16 = 349 days remaining in 2012. 349 days into 2012: 349 / 365 ≈ 0.956 years. So 2012 ends on 12/31/2012. From 16/03/2012 to 12/31/2012: 31-16=15 days in March, then April (30), May (31), June (30), July (31), August (31), September (30), October (31), November (30), December (31). Total: 15+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 = 306 days. 306 days in 2012. Remaining days: 280 - 306 = negative, so 280 days is 365 - 306 = 59 days into 2013. So 16/03/2012 + 280 days = 16/03/2012 + 306 days (to end of 2012) + 59 days (into 2013). 306 days later is 12/31/2012 + 59 days. 12/31/2012 + 59 days: January has 31, February 28 (2013 is not a leap year), March 31. 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days. 59 days into that: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59 days. So 12/31/2012 + 59 days = 2/28/2013. Then add 59 days: 2/28/2013 + 59 days. 28 + 31 (March) = 59 days. So 3/29/2013. Wait, but this contradicts the previous method. Hmm, there must be an error here. Let me recalculate. Starting from 16/03/2012, adding 280 days. Let's break it down month by month. March 2012: 16 days left in March. April: 30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:31, September:30, October:31, November:30, December:31. Total days from March to December 2012: 16 (March) + 30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 = 16 + 30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +31=169, +30=199, +31=230, +30=260, +31=291. So from March 16 to December 31, 2012: 291 days. 280 days total needed. 280 - 291 = -11 days. So we need to go back 11 days from December 31, 2012. That would be November 20, 2012. Wait, no. Wait, 291 days from March 16, 2012, to December 31, 2012. So 280 days is 11 days less than that. So subtract 11 days from December 31, 2012: 12/31/2012 - 11 days = 12/20/2012. So the due date would be 12/20/2012. But that can't be right because adding 280 days to ovulation (16/03/2012) should be around 40 weeks later. There's a discrepancy here. This suggests an error in calculation. Let me use a different approach. Using Naegele's Rule directly: LMP is 02/03/2012. Add 7 days: 09/03/2012. Add 9 months: 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days: 07/03/2013 + 14 days = 21/03/2013. Alternatively, some sources say that Naegele's Rule is simply adding 7 days to LMP and then 9 months. So 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 09/03/2012. Adding 9 months: 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days: 07/03/2013 + 14 days = 21/03/2013. However, another source might say that after adding 9 months, you add 14 days. So the final answer is March 21, 2013. But let's verify with another method. Let's use an online calculator. According to Naegele's Rule, the formula is: Due Date = LMP + 7 days + 9 months. So 02/03/2012 + 7 days = 09/03/2012. Adding 9 months: 09/03/2012 + 9 months = 07/03/2013. Then add 14 days: 07/03/2013 + 14 days = 21/03/2013. Therefore, the estimated due date is March 21, 2013. However, some sources might state that after adding 9 months, you add 14 days. So the correct answer is 03/21/2013. But I need to ensure that the cycle length is 28 days. Since the cycle is regular at 28 days, ovulation is around day 14. Adding 40 weeks (280 days) to ovulation date: 16/03/2012 + 280 days. Let's compute 280 days from 16/03/2012. 2012 is a leap year, so February has 29 days. Let's calculate: March 16, 2012. Adding 280 days. Breakdown: March 2012: 16 days left. April: 30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:31, September:30, October:31, November:30, December:31. Total days from March to December 2012: 16 + 30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 = 16 + 273 = 289 days. 280 days needed. Subtract 289 days from March 16, 2012: 280 days is 9 days less than 289. So subtract 9 days from March 16, 2012: 3/16/2012 - 9 days = 3/07/2012. But that's before the LMP. This inconsistency suggests an error. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add 7 days to LMP and then 9 months. So 02/03/2012 +7 days =09/03/2012. Adding 9 months: 09/03/2012 +9 months =07/03/2013. Then add 14 days:07/03/2013 +14 days=21/03/2013. Therefore, the estimated due date is March 21, 2013. This aligns with Naegele's Rule as per standard medical practice. Hence, the answer is 03/21/2013. <|end_of_solution|>

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old female residing in a nursing home is brought to the outpatient department by her nurse for a regular health check. Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L. An arterial blood gas analysis reports a pH of 7.40 and PaO2 at 80 mm Hg. Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion.

Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old female residing in a nursing home is brought to the outpatient department by her nurse for a regular health check. Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L. An arterial blood gas analysis reports a pH of 7.40 and PaO2 at 80 mm Hg. Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L. An arterial blood gas analysis reports a pH of 7.40 and PaO2 at 80 mm Hg. Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion. Here is the task: What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)?

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure. Key findings include a respiratory rate of 22 (within normal range), BUN at 27 (slightly high), glucose at 180 (elevated), hematocrit at 39% (normal), PaO2 at 80 mmHg (mild hypoxemia), and pleural effusion noted. 1. **Age**: 75 years old. Since age starts scoring at 65, each 10 years adds 1 point. 75 - 65 = 10 years → 1 point. 2. **Respiratory Rate**: 22 breaths per minute (normal range is typically <20). No points here. 3. **BUN**: 27 mg/dL falls into 11-20 range → 3 points. 4. **Glucose**: 180 mg/dL is in 140-199 range → 2 points. 5. **Hematocrit**: 39% is within 30-39 range → 2 points. 6. **PaO2**: 80 mmHg is in 80-89 range → 4 points. 7. **Pleural Effusion**: Present → 2 points. 8. Other parameters like severe hypoxemia, acidosis, etc., are not mentioned. Summing these: 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 14. However, the PSI uses a lookup table where scores map to specific ranges. The total score of 14 corresponds to a PSI category of 14-17, which has a mortality risk of approximately 1.5%. But since the exact categories might vary based on the latest version of the PSI, the final answer is derived from the calculated sum.", "answer": "14"} <|end_of_solution|>

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure. Key findings include a respiratory rate of 22 (within normal range), BUN at 27 (slightly high), glucose at 180 (elevated), hematocrit at 39% (normal), PaO2 at 80 mmHg (mild hypoxemia), and pleural effusion noted. 1. **Age**: 75 years old. Since age starts scoring at 65, each 10 years adds 1 point. 75 - 65 = 10 years → 1 point. 2. **Respiratory Rate**: 22 breaths per minute (normal range is typically <20). No points here. 3. **BUN**: 27 mg/dL falls into 11-20 range → 3 points. 4. **Glucose**: 180 mg/dL is in 140-199 range → 2 points. 5. **Hematocrit**: 39% is within 30-39 range → 2 points. 6. **PaO2**: 80 mmHg is in 80-89 range → 4 points. 7. **Pleural Effusion**: Present → 2 points. 8. Other parameters like severe hypoxemia, acidosis, etc., are not mentioned. Summing these: 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 14. However, the PSI uses a lookup table where scores map to specific ranges. The total score of 14 corresponds to a PSI category of 14-17, which has a mortality risk of approximately 1.5%. But since the exact categories might vary based on the latest version of the PSI, the final answer is derived from the calculated sum.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 75.0 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75.0 = 75.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75.0 - 10 = 65.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 10 = 85.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85.0 + 10 = 95.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 82.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 95.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

THINKING USED  To calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding score, we need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the patient's risk of rebleeding (R) based on the presence of certain risk factors: - R = 0 if none of the following are present: - Active upper GI bleeding - Active lower GI bleeding - Hemodynamic instability (hypotension) - Severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL) - Age > 60 years - Renal failure (BUN > 20 mg/dL) - Sepsis - Liver disease - Pregnancy - Malignancy - R = 1 if one of the above risk factors is present - R = 2 if two or more of the above risk factors are present 2. Determine the patient's clinical classification (C) based on the presence of certain clinical signs: - C = 1 if the patient is hemodynamically stable (BP > 90 mmHg systolic, HR < 100 beats per minute) - C = 2 if the patient is hemodynamically unstable (BP < 90 mmHg systolic or HR > 100 beats per minute) 3. Determine the patient's severity of bleeding (S) based on the amount of blood loss: - S = 1 if melena (black, tarry stools) is present - S = 2 if hematemesis (vomiting blood) is present 4. Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding score (GBS) using the formula: GBS = R + 4C + 1.5S Now, let's apply these steps to the patient's information: R = 0 (no risk factors present) C = 1 (patient is hemodynamically stable) S = 1 (melena is present) GBS = R + 4C + 1.5S GBS = 0 + 4(1) + 1.5(1) GBS = 0 + 4 + 1.5 GBS = 5.5

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.
The patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each symptom based on its severity. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of fever in children. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The patient's symptoms are: - Fever: 39.6°C - Drooling - Loud snoring - Noisy breathing - Hoarseness - Inability to eat solids - Persistence of fever According to the FeverPAIN scoring system: - Fever: 3 points for a temperature above 39°C, 2 points for 38-39°C, and 1 point for 37-38°C. - Drooling: 2 points - Loud snoring: 2 points - Noisy breathing: 2 points - Hoarseness: 2 points - Inability to eat solids: 2 points Adding up the points, we get: 3 (fever) + 2 (drooling) + 2 (loud snoring) + 2 (noisy breathing) + 2 (hoarseness) + 2 (inability to eat solids) = 13 points The FeverPAIN score is 13.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

Because the age is greater than 74, two points added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2.\nThe patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 2.\nThe patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nOne criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Because thromboembolism history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it to be absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3.\nBased on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

THINKING USED Step 1: Identify the necessary parameters to calculate the FIB-4 index. The FIB-4 index is a non-invasive scoring system that combines liver enzymes (AST and ALT) with age and platelet count to estimate liver fibrosis. The formula is: FIB-4 = (AST/ALT) x age x platelet count / (kW), where kW is a constant that depends on the laboratory (kW = 1 for men and 0.75 for women). Step 2: Determine the patient's age and platelet count. The patient's age is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, we can infer that the patient is a 2-year-old female. However, the FIB-4 index is typically calculated for adults. Since the patient is a child, we will use the child's age as a proxy for the adult's age. Assuming the patient is 2 years old, we can use the adult value of kW = 1. The patient's platelet count is 101,000/μL. Step 3: Determine the patient's AST and ALT values. The patient's AST value is 87 IU/L and ALT value is 104 IU/L. Step 4: Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula. FIB-4 = (87/104) x 2 x 101,000 / 1 = 1.69 Step 5: Interpret the result. The FIB-4 index is a continuous value that ranges from 0 to 3.5. A higher value indicates more severe liver fibrosis. In this case, the FIB-4 index is 1.69, which suggests that the patient has mild liver fibrosis. <result> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's age is assumed to be 2 years old, and the platelet count is 101,000/μL.

The FIB-4 index is a non-invasive scoring system that combines liver enzymes (AST and ALT) with age and platelet count to estimate liver fibrosis. The formula is: FIB-4 = (AST/ALT) x age x platelet count / (kW), where kW is a constant that depends on the laboratory (kW = 1 for men and 0.75 for women). Step 2: Determine the patient\'s age and platelet count. The patient\'s age is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, we can infer that the patient is a 2-year-old female. However, the FIB-4 index is typically calculated for adults. Since the patient is a child, we will use the child\'s age as a proxy for the adult\'s age. Assuming the patient is 2 years old, we can use the adult value of kW = 1. The patient\'s platelet count is 101,000/μL. Step 3: Determine the patient\'s AST and ALT values. The patient\'s AST value is 87 IU/L and ALT value is 104 IU/L. Step 4: Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula. FIB-4 = (87/104) x 2 x 101,000 / 1 = 1.69 Step 5: Interpret the result. The FIB-4 index is a continuous value that ranges from 0 to 3.5. A higher value indicates more severe liver fibrosis. In this case, the FIB-4 index is 1.69, which suggests that the patient has mild liver fibrosis. <result> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient\'s age is assumed to be 2 years old, and the platelet count is 101,000/μL.

Plugging in the numbers: (87/104) × 2 × 101,000 = 1.69. This indicates mild liver fibrosis.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.169', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 87.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 104.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 101000.0 count/µL. To convert 101000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 101000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 101000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 101000000000.0/(10^9) = 101.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (2 * 87.0)/(101.0 * sqrt(104.0)) = 0.169.\nHence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 0.169.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range. The plan is to continue monitoring her closely and to adjust her therapies as needed based on the comprehensive assessment of her case.

THINKING USED  To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, we need to follow these steps: 1. First, we need to convert the patient's heart rate from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bps). We can do this by dividing the heart rate by 60. 2. Next, we need to convert the QT interval from milliseconds (msec) to seconds. We can do this by dividing the QT interval by 1000. 3. Now, we can plug these values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR) * 1000, where QTc is the corrected QT interval, QT is the patient's QT interval, and RR is the patient's heart rate in seconds. 4. We will use the values from the patient's note: QT = 330 msec and RR = 136 bpm. 5. First, convert the heart rate from bpm to bps: 136 bpm / 60 = 2.267 bps. 6. Next, convert the QT interval from msec to sec: 330 msec / 1000 = 0.33 sec. 7. Now, plug these values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = 0.33 / sqrt(2.267) * 1000. 8. Calculate the square root of the heart rate: sqrt(2.267) = 1.5. 9. Now, calculate the corrected QT interval: QTc = 0.33 / 1.5 * 1000 = 220 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge.

THINKING USED  To find the patient's target weight, we need to use the formula for BMI, which is weight (in kg) divided by the square of height (in meters). The formula is: BMI = weight / height^2. We are given the target BMI (18.5) and the height (145 cm), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for weight: weight = BMI * height^2. First, we need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so we divide the height by 100: 145 cm / 100 = 1.45 m. Next, we square the height: 1.45^2 = 2.1025. Now we can multiply the target BMI by the squared height to find the target weight: 18.5 * 2.1025 = 38.76 kg. Therefore, the patient's target weight is approximately 38.76 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative. Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization. Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

{'Row Number': 747, 'Calculator Name': 'Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '63', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-3094288-1', 'Patient Note': "A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.", 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '42.7', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results and identify the relevant information for calculating the delta gap.

However, the answer requires rounding to the nearest whole number, resulting in 212 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '-4', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 19-year-old male with a past medical history of surgical repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament and seasonal allergies presents to the emergency department with a rash. He reports that he first noticed the rash on his torso when he woke up this morning, and it has spread down his legs over the last few hours. He also endorses fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days. The patient reports that he was seen yesterday at his college’s student health clinic for similar symptoms and was prescribed amoxicillin. He also reports that his younger sister was recently diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis, and his mother has psoriatic arthritis. He is a sophomore on the men’s soccer team, but he has had to sit out of practice for the last several days. His home medications include cetirizine and fluticasone nasal spray. He has no known drug allergies. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 122/76 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 16/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

THINKING USED  Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and medical history to identify potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not mentioned, but he is a smoker, which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes PE. Step 2: Evaluate the patient's clinical presentation for signs and symptoms of PE. The patient presents with sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea, which are classic symptoms of PE. Step 3: Assess the patient's risk factors for PE. The patient has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for VTE. Step 4: Review the diagnostic tests performed to rule out PE. The patient underwent a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), troponin I level, brain natriuretic peptide level, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Step 5: Evaluate the results of the diagnostic tests. The chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema, which is not specific for PE. The EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities, which is not specific for PE. The troponin I level was elevated, indicating myocardial injury, which is not specific for PE. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated, indicating heart failure, which is not specific for PE. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which is not specific for PE. Step 6: Review the results of the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in light of the negative CT scan. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which was initially misinterpreted as a normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact. Step 7: Apply the Perioperative Pulmonary Embolism (PERC) Rule. The PERC Rule is a clinical prediction rule that predicts the probability of pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The rule includes the following criteria: - Age ≥ 40 years - Recent surgery or hospitalization - Recent trauma - Cancer - Prior DVT or PE - Immobilization - Surgery in the lower extremities - Obesity -

Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection.

<|begin_of_thought|> Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and medical history to identify potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not mentioned, but he is a smoker, which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes PE. Step 2: Evaluate the patient's clinical presentation for signs and symptoms of PE. The patient presents with sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea, which are classic symptoms of PE. Step 3: Assess the patient's risk factors for PE. The patient has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for VTE. Step 4: Review the diagnostic tests performed to rule out PE. The patient underwent a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), troponin I level, brain natriuretic peptide level, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Step 5: Evaluate the results of the diagnostic tests. The chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema, which is not specific for PE. The EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities, which is not specific for PE. The troponin I level was elevated, indicating myocardial injury, which is not specific for PE. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated, indicating heart failure, which is not specific for PE. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which is not specific for PE. Step 6: Review the results of the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in light of the negative CT scan. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which was initially misinterpreted as a normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact. Step 7: Apply the Perioperative Pulmonary Embolism (PERC) Rule. The PERC Rule is a clinical prediction rule that predicts the probability of pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The rule includes the following criteria: - Age ≥ 40 years - Recent surgery or hospitalization - Recent trauma - Cancer - Prior DVT or PE - Immobilization - Surgery in the lower extremities - Obesity -

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L. On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact. Here is the task: What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <|begin_of_thought|> Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and medical history to identify potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not mentioned, but he is a smoker, which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes PE. Step 2: Evaluate the patient's clinical presentation for signs and symptoms of PE. The patient presents with sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea, which are classic symptoms of PE. Step 3: Assess the patient's risk factors for PE. The patient has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for VTE. Step 4: Review the diagnostic tests performed to rule out PE. The patient underwent a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), troponin I level, brain natriuretic peptide level, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Step 5: Evaluate the results of the diagnostic tests. The chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema, which is not specific for PE. The EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities, which is not specific for PE. The troponin I level was elevated, indicating myocardial injury, which is not specific for PE. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated, indicating heart failure, which is not specific for PE. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which is not specific for PE. Step 6: Review the results of the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in light of the negative CT scan. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which was initially misinterpreted as a normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

While smoking is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), it is not one of the specific criteria listed in the PERC Rule. 2. **Clinical Presentation:** The patient's symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea) and findings (acute pulmonary edema, heart failure) are more indicative of aortic dissection rather than PE. 3. **Diagnostic Tests:** The patient underwent a CT scan, TEE, and other tests, none of which were positive for PE. The initial CT scan and EKG results did not suggest PE. 4. **PERC Rule Criteria:** The PERC Rule evaluates risk factors like recent surgery, trauma, cancer, etc., none of which apply here. The patient's condition was ultimately diagnosed as aortic dissection, not PE. **Answer:** {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient does not meet any criteria for the PERC Rule. Smoking is a risk factor for VTE but not part of the PERC Rule. Clinical presentation and diagnostic tests ruled out PE.

{'Row Number': 585, 'Calculator Name': 'PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism', 'Calculator ID': '48', 'Category': 'diagnosis', 'Note ID': 'pmc-3883470-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.\nOn the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.', 'Question': 'What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?', 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '0', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and medical history to identify potential risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not mentioned, but he is a smoker, which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes PE. Step 2: Evaluate the patient's clinical presentation for signs and symptoms of PE. The patient presents with sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea, which are classic symptoms of PE. Step 3: Assess the patient's risk factors for PE. The patient has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for VTE. Step 4: Review the diagnostic tests performed to rule out PE. The patient underwent a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), troponin I level, brain natriuretic peptide level, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Step 5: Evaluate the results of the diagnostic tests. The chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema, which is not specific for PE. The EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities, which is not specific for PE. The troponin I level was elevated, indicating myocardial injury, which is not specific for PE. The brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated, indicating heart failure, which is not specific for PE. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which is not specific for PE. Step 6: Review the results of the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in light of the negative CT scan. The TEE showed an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, which was initially misinterpreted as a normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact. Step 7: Apply the Perioperative Pulmonary Embolism (PERC) Rule. The PERC Rule is a clinical prediction rule that predicts the probability of pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. The rule includes the following criteria: - Age ≥ 40 years - Recent surgery or hospitalization - Recent trauma - Cancer - Prior DVT or PE - Immobilization - Surgery in the lower extremities - Obesity - Recent surgery in the upper extremities - Recent surgery in the pelvis - Recent surgery in the abdomen - Recent surgery in the lower back - Recent surgery in the brain - Recent surgery in the spine -

 Here is the patient note:
A healthy 22-year-old male participates in a research study you are leading to compare the properties of skeletal and cardiac muscle. You conduct a 3-phased experiment with the participant. In the first phase, you get him to lift up a 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight off a table with his left hand. In the second phase, you get him to do 20 burpees, taking his heart rate to 150/min. In the third phase, you electrically stimulate his gastrocnemius with a frequency of 50 Hz. You are interested in the tension and electrical activity of specific muscles as follows: Biceps in phase 1, cardiac muscle in phase 2, and gastrocnemius in phase 3.

Here is the task:
Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's maintenance fluid, we need to consider the patient's weight and the fact that the task doesn't provide any information about the patient's activity level, medical conditions, or other factors that might affect fluid needs. However, a general rule of thumb for calculating maintenance fluid is to use the following formula: - For adults, the maintenance fluid is approximately 20-30 mL/kg/hour. Given the patient's weight is 2.3 kg, we can calculate the maintenance fluid as follows: - 20 mL/kg/hour * 2.3 kg = 46 mL/hour

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

She was transferred to the facility 1 day ago following discharge from the hospital with injuries including multiple rib fractures, a left femoral shaft fracture, and a traumatic brain injury. There was no spinal cord damage or paralysis bhe patient remains confined to bed due to her injuries. The patient denies history of heart failure, any recent infections or sepsis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy. Prior coagulability workup in the patient revealed elevated serum homocysteine, and was otherwise negative for factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibody. Heparin has been administered throughout the hospitalization with no complications and the patient has no other history of congenital or acquired thrombophilia. The patient's mother had a DVT/PE in her 50's. The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. Physical exam of the lower extremities is notable for a well-healed surgical incision over the left femoral shaft with no signs of infection. There patient has varicose veins bilaterally. There is no lower extremity edema. Range of motion of the left hip and knee are limited due to pain and immobilization. The patient will continue rehabilitation with physical and occupational therapy at the facility to optimize functional recovery.

First, we need to calculate the QTc interval using the Rautaharju Formula: QTc = QT / (1 + (0.04 * HR)), where QT is the measured QT interval in milliseconds and HR is the patient's heart rate in beats per minute. 2. Given the patient's heart rate is 79 bpm, we can plug in the values into the formula: QTc = 330 / (1 + (0.04 * 79)). 3. Now, we can calculate the value inside the parentheses first: 0.04 * 79 = 3.16. 4. Then, we add 1 to the result: 1 + 3.16 = 4.16. 5. Finally, we divide the QT interval by the result: 330 / 4.16 = 79.7 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

THINKING USED  To calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP), we need to know the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The formula for MAP is: MAP = (2 x SBP + DBP) / 3. First, we need to find the SBP and DBP from the given information. The blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, and when she stood up, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg. Since we are looking for the mean arterial pressure, we should consider the lowest blood pressure reading as the DBP. Therefore, DBP = 40 mm Hg. The SBP is the higher value between the two blood pressure readings, which is 89 mm Hg. Now, we can calculate the MAP: MAP = (2 x 89 + 40) / 3 = (178 + 40) / 3 = 218 / 3 = 72.67 mm Hg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to use the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)². First, we need to convert the patient's height from centimeters to meters. The patient's height is 165.0 cm, which is equal to 1.65 m. Next, we can plug in the values into the BMI formula: BMI = 60.2 kg / (1.65 m)². Now, let's calculate the denominator: (1.65 m)² = 2.7225 m². Now, we can calculate the BMI: BMI = 60.2 kg / 2.7225 m² = 22.1 kg/m². Therefore, the patient's BMI is 22.1 kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each symptom based on its severity. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of fever and pain in patients. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least severe and 10 being the most severe. Here are the steps to calculate the FeverPAIN score: 1. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever, which is a mild symptom. I will assign a score of 2 for fever. 2. Pain: The patient had severe neck pain, which is a moderate to severe symptom. I will assign a score of 8 for pain. 3. Swallowing difficulty: The patient had painful swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 5 for swallowing difficulty. 4. Choking and coughing: The patient had an attack of choking and coughing while eating, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for choking and coughing. 5. Tenderness: The patient had tenderness in the left side of the neck, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 5 for tenderness. 6. Dysphagia: The patient had difficulty swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 5 for dysphagia. 7. Foreign body aspiration: The patient had a foreign body (chicken bone) aspirated into the airway, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for foreign body aspiration. 8. Abscess formation: The patient did not have any evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for abscess formation. 9. Treatment: The patient received appropriate treatment, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for treatment. 10. Follow-up: The patient had a good follow-up, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for follow-up. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score: FeverPAIN score = (2 x 1) + (8 x 2) + (5 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (5 x 1) + (5 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (4 x 1) = 2 + 16 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 63 FeverPAIN score = 63 / 10 = 6.3

On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms. On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation. The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized.

The patient's last menstrual period was on 07/18/2010. Today's date is 02/09/2011.

Here is the task:
Based on the patient's last menstrual period, what is the patient's estimated gestational age? Your answer should be a tuple, specifying the number of weeks and days (i.e. (4 weeks, 3 days), (0 weeks, 5 days), (1 week, 5 days), (8 weeks, 0 days)).

THINKING USED  Step 1: Calculate the difference between the current year and the year of the last menstrual period. The current year is 2011, and the year of the last menstrual period is 2010. The difference is 1 year. <think> Step 2: Calculate the difference between the current month and the month of the last menstrual period. The current month is February, and the month of the last menstrual period is July. Since February is the 2nd month of the year, and July is the 7th month of the year, the difference is 5 months. <think> Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks from the last menstrual period to the current date. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of weeks as follows: 5 months * 4 weeks/month = 20 weeks <think> Step 4: Calculate the number of days from the last menstrual period to the current date. Since the current date is February 9th, and the last menstrual period was on July 18th, we need to calculate the number of days from July 18th to February 9th. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. July 18th to December 31st is 5 months * 31 days/month = 155 days January has 31 days, and February has 9 days (from 1st to 9th). So, the total number of days is 155 + 31 + 9 = 195 days <think> Step 5: Calculate the estimated gestational age. The estimated gestational age is the number of weeks and days from the last menstrual period to the current date. We already calculated the number of weeks as 20 weeks, and the number of days as 195 days. Since 7 days is equal to 1 week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7. 195 days / 7 days/week = 27 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. So, the estimated gestational age is (20 weeks, 6 days). <think> Step 6: Format the answer as a tuple. The estimated gestational age is (20 weeks, 6 days). <think> Step 7: Format the answer as a JSON dict. The answer is a tuple, so we need to convert it to a JSON dict. ```json { "step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated gestational age, we first calculate the difference between the current year and the year of the last menstrual period (1 year), and the difference between the current month and the month of the last menstrual period (5 months).

The current year is 2011, and the year of the last menstrual period is 2010. The difference is 1 year. <think> Step 2: Calculate the difference between the current month and the month of the last menstrual period. The current month is February, and the month of the last menstrual period is July. Since February is the 2nd month of the year, and July is the 7th month of the year, the difference is 5 months. <think> Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks from the last menstrual period to the current date. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of weeks as follows: 5 months * 4 weeks/month = 20 weeks <think> Step 4: Calculate the number of days from the last menstrual period to the current date. Since the current date is February 9th, and the last menstrual period was on July 18th, we need to calculate the number of days from July 18th to February 9th. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. July 18th to December 31st is 5 months * 31 days/month = 155 days January has 31 days, and February has 9 days (from 1st to 9th).

The estimated gestational age is the number of weeks and days from the last menstrual period to the current date. We already calculated the number of weeks as 20 weeks, and the number of days as 195 days.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The patient's lab results show an anion gap of 30 mmol/L, which is calculated as the difference between the sum of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and the sum of bicarbonate and the sum of the other measured cations (calcium and magnesium). The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = (Na+ + K+ + Cl-) - (HCO3- + Ca2+). <|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|> To determine the patient's delta gap, we first calculate the anion gap using the provided lab values. The formula is: Anion Gap = (Na⁺ + K⁺ + Cl⁻) - (HCO₃⁻ + Ca²⁺) Plugging in the values: Na⁺ = 137 mmol/L K⁺ = 5.0 mmol/L Cl⁻ = 98 mmol/L HCO₃⁻ = 9 mmol/L Ca²⁺ = 7 mmol/L (corrected calcium) Calculating: (137 + 5 + 98) - (9 + 7) = 240 - 16 = 224 mmol/L? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the standard formula is (Na + Cl - HCO3) minus K. Let me check again. The correct formula is: Anion Gap = Na+ + Cl− − (HCO3− + K+) So: 137 + 98 - (9 + 5) = 235 - 14 = 221 mmol/L. But the report states the anion gap is 30 mmol/L. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the calculation or the given values. However, the problem asks for the delta gap, which typically refers to the difference between the measured anion gap and the calculated anion gap based on normal cations. The normal cations are usually assumed to be 2.5 mmol/L (Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺). So, the calculated anion gap would be: Na+ + Cl− − (HCO3− + K+ + 2.5) = 137 + 98 - (9 + 5 + 2.5) = 235 - 16.5 = 218.5 mmol/L. The measured anion gap is 30 mmol/L. Therefore, the delta gap is the difference between the measured and calculated anion gaps: 30 - 218.5 = -188.5 mmol/L. But this seems extremely low, which might indicate a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the anion gap itself as the delta gap. However, the term "delta gap" isn't standard. Rechecking the question: The task says "delta gap in mEq/L". Given the lab result explicitly states the anion gap is 30 mmol/L, and the delta gap might refer to the difference between the measured and the calculated (normal) anion gap. The calculated anion gap is approximately 218.5 mmol/L, so delta gap would be 30 - 218.5 = -188.5. However, this is highly unusual. Alternatively, if the question is asking for the anion gap value itself, it's 30. But the term "delta gap" is unclear. Given the context, the answer expected is likely the anion gap value, which is 30 mmol/L. But the user might have intended the delta between measured and calculated. However, without explicit clarification, the most direct answer is the anion gap as reported. **Final Answer** The patient's anion gap is **30 mmol/L**, so the delta gap (difference from calculated) is **-188.5 mmol/L**. However, if the question refers to the anion gap itself, the answer is **30 mmol/L**. Given the phrasing, the answer is likely **30 mmol/L**. But considering the term "delta gap", which implies change, and the calculated vs measured, the answer is -188.5. However, the exact interpretation is ambiguous. Given the data, the measured anion gap is 30, and the calculated is ~218.5, so delta is -188.5. But the problem may expect the anion gap value. **Answer** {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, first compute the anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = (Na+ + Cl−) - (HCO3− + K+).

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on six different organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological. The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24 points, with higher scores indicating more organ dysfunction. Here are the steps to calculate the SOFA score: 1. Respiratory: The patient is on CPAP with a FiO2 of 54% and a PaO2 of 77 mmHg. We will use the PaO2 value to calculate the respiratory score. The formula is: Respiratory score = (PaO2 / 4) + 2.5. Respiratory score = (77 / 4) + 2.5 = 19.75 2. Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is stable at 120/80 mmHg, and she is on multiple vasopressors. We will use the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to calculate the cardiovascular score. The formula is: Cardiovascular score = MAP - 90. MAP = (120 + 80) / 2 = 100. Cardiovascular score = 100 - 90 = 10 3. Hepatic: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated at 1.7 mg/dL. We will use the bilirubin value to calculate the hepatic score. The formula is: Hepatic score = Bilirubin (mg/dL) + 1. The patient's creatinine level is also slightly elevated at 1.9 mg/dL, but we will not use it for this calculation. Hepatic score = 1.7 + 1 = 2.7 4. Coagulation: The patient's platelet count is normal at 180,000/µL. We will use the platelet count to calculate the coagulation score. The formula is: Coagulation score = Platelet count (x 10^9/L) - 100. Coagulation score = 180,000 - 100 = 179,900 5. Renal: The patient's urine output is somewhat regular at 925 mL/day. We will use the urine output to calculate the renal score. The formula is: Renal score = Urine output (mL/min) - 0.5. Renal score = 925 / 24 = 38.54, rounded to 39 6. Neurological: The patient's Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is 13. We will use the GCS to calculate the neurological score. The formula is: Neurological score = GCS - 5. Neurological score = 13 - 5 = 8 Now, let's add up the scores for each organ system: Respiratory score: 19.75 Cardiovascular score: 10 Hepatic score: 2.7 Coagulation score: 179,900 Renal score: 39 Neurological score: 8 Total SOFA score = 19.75 + 10 + 2.7 + 179,900 + 39 + 8 = 180,858.45 Since the SOFA score cannot exceed 24, we will round down to 24. <end> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we evaluated the patient's condition based on six different organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological.

Respiratory: The patient is on CPAP with a FiO2 of 54% and a PaO2 of 77 mmHg. We will use the PaO2 value to calculate the respiratory score. The formula is: Respiratory score = (PaO2 / 4) + 2.5. Respiratory score = (77 / 4) + 2.5 = 19.75 2. Cardiovascular: The patient\'s blood pressure is stable at 120/80 mmHg, and she is on multiple vasopressors. We will use the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to calculate the cardiovascular score. The formula is: Cardiovascular score = MAP - 90. MAP = (120 + 80) / 2 = 100. Cardiovascular score = 100 - 90 = 10 3. Hepatic: The patient\'s bilirubin levels are elevated at 1.7 mg/dL. We will use the bilirubin value to calculate the hepatic score. The formula is: Hepatic score = Bilirubin (mg/dL) + 1. The patient\'s creatinine level is also slightly elevated at 1.9 mg/dL, but we will not use it for this calculation. Hepatic score = 1.7 + 1 = 2.7 4. Coagulation: The patient\'s platelet count is normal at 180,000/µL. We will use the platelet count to calculate the coagulation score. The formula is: Coagulation score = Platelet count (x 10^9/L) - 100. Coagulation score = 180,000 - 100 = 179,900 5. Renal: The patient\'s urine output is somewhat regular at 925 mL/day. We will use the urine output to calculate the renal score. The formula is: Renal score = Urine output (mL/min) - 0.5. Renal score = 925 / 24 = 38.54, rounded to 39 6. Neurological: The patient\'s Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is 13. We will use the GCS to calculate the neurological score. The formula is: Neurological score = GCS - 5. Neurological score = 13 - 5 = 8 Now, let\'s add up the scores for each organ system: Respiratory score: 19.75 Cardiovascular score: 10 Hepatic score: 2.7 Coagulation score: 179,900 Renal score: 39 Neurological score: 8 Total SOFA score = 19.75 + 10 + 2.7 + 179,900 + 39 + 8 = 180,858.45 Since the SOFA score cannot exceed 24, we will round down to 24. <end> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient\'s Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we evaluated the patient\'s condition based on six different organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological.

The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. For two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 13 and 14, we add 1 point to the score, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

A 73-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department following an acute abdominal pain that started suddenly 8 hours ago. He has a known history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, for which he takes insulin daily, and liver cirrhosis. The patient denies any history of cerebrovascular events or ischemic heart disease. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, heart rate is 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and he is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2°C. Auscultation of the chest reveals no rales, S3 gallop, or signs of congestive heart failure. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 15, indicating full consciousness. Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function, and a sodium level of 143.21 mmol/L and a potassium level of 3.68 mmol/L. His fraction of inspired air is 63 %.  His arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.29, a PaO2 of 78 mm Hg, and an A-a gradient of 331 mm Hg while on room air. Hematocrit is at 41 %, and white blood cell count is 15,105 cells/µL. Given his acute presentation, history of diabetes managed with insulin, and laboratory findings, a thorough evaluation including imaging and further laboratory tests is warranted to assess the severity and underlying cause of his symptoms.

Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

A 59-year-old gentleman presents with episodes of dizziness and palpitations. His past medical history is significant for a previous stroke and uncontrolled hypertension (182/111). Blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80 % of the time. A significant bleeding event that happened following a minor operative procedure is documented and requires careful attention. His lifestyle habits include moderate alcohol consumption, tallying approximately three alcoholic beverages per week.

THINKING USED  To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Fridericia Formula, we need to know the patient's heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) and the QT interval in milliseconds (msec). The Fridericia Formula is as follows: QTc = QT / √(1 + (1/300 * (HR - 60)^2)) where QTc is the corrected QT interval, QT is the measured QT interval, HR is the heart rate, and 300 is a constant.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. He had a history of five similar episodes in the past.

{'Row Number': 50, 'Calculator Name': 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Calculator ID': '4', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4369977-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to break down the patient's medical history into its components and assign points accordingly. 1.

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

THINKING USED  Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and vital signs to identify potential SIRS criteria. The patient has a fever (38.5℃), tachycardia (heart rate 68 beats per minute), and coarse crackles in both lower lung fields, which may indicate an infectious process. Step 2: Evaluate the patient's laboratory results to confirm the presence of an infection.

The C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels are also elevated, suggesting an infection. Step 3: Assess the patient's respiratory status to determine if there are any signs of respiratory distress. The patient has a respiratory rate of 20 per minute, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly so. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.439, PCO2 of 36.3 mm Hg, and PO2 of 52.4 mm Hg, which are within normal limits. Step 4: Review the patient's chest radiography and CT scan results to identify any signs of pneumonia or other pulmonary abnormalities. The chest radiography and CT scan show multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields, which are consistent with pneumonia. Step 5: Evaluate the patient's overall clinical picture to determine if the SIRS criteria are met. Based on the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and respiratory symptoms, the SIRS criteria are met. Step 6: Count the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient.

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields. Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4. After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass. Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma. We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Miligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its equivalent dose in Morphine Milligrams (MME) and then sum them up. 1. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg per dose, taken 1 time a day. Since it's a patch, the dose is constant throughout the day, so we can use the same dose value as is. 2. Hydrocodone (Hydromorphone): 20 mg per dose, taken 3 times a day. Since it's taken 3 times a day, we multiply the dose by 3 to get the total daily dose. 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg 3. Fentanyl buccal: 30 mg per dose, taken 2 times a day. Since it's taken 2 times a day, we multiply the dose by 2 to get the total daily dose. 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg Now, we add up the total daily doses of all medications: 60 mg (Fentanyl patch) + 60 mg (Hydromorphone) + 60 mg (Fentanyl buccal) = 180 mg

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.\nHe came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.\nOn exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.\nChest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.\nHe underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.\nFollow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.\nHe was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CURB-65 score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '0', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " Step 1: Identify the patient's CURB-65 components The CURB-65 score is a clinical prediction rule used to estimate the severity of pneumonia. It consists of five components: - C: Confusion (yes or no) - U: Urea (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL or acute kidney injury) - R: Respiratory rate (≥ 30 breaths/min) - B: Blood pressure (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg) - 65: Age ≥ 65 years ", 'LLM Explanation': 'The patient does not meet any of the CURB-65 criteria, so the CURB-65 score is 0.', 'Target Model': 'open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B', 'Target Answer': '0', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the CURB-65 score, I first need to identify each component from the patient's data. The patient is a 41-year-old man, so age <65, which doesn't contribute to the 65 component. Next, check for confusion: the note mentions he had LLQ pain and UTI issues but no mention of confusion. Urea: serum creatinine wasn't explicitly stated, but his labs showed potassium 3.3 (low), magnesium 1.5 (low), and lactate 2.2. These electrolyte imbalances might suggest renal issues, but the note says no liver lesions. However, the presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia could indicate chronic kidney disease, which might elevate urea. But since it wasn't directly measured, maybe not. Respiratory rate: 19 breaths/min, which is below 30. Blood pressure: BP 121/79, both within normal range. So none of the components are met except possibly age, but he's 41. Therefore, CURB-65 score is 0.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '1', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points.\nThe patient is 41.0 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0.\nWhether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 21.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 121 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 79 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 1.\nThe patient's Curb-65 score is 1.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

THINKING USED Step 1: Review the patient's information to determine their BMI. The patient's height is 168.0 cm, and their weight is 68 kg. We can calculate their BMI as follows: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2 First, we need to convert the patient's height from cm to m: height (m) = 168.0 cm / 100 = 1.68 m Now we can calculate the BMI: BMI = 68 kg / (1.68 m)^2 = 68 kg / 2.8224 m^2 = 24.1 Since the patient's BMI is 24.1, which is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), we will use their actual weight as the adjusted body weight. Step 2: Use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The Cockroft-Gault Equation is as follows: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) * (weight (kg) / 72) * (0.85 if female) * (1.04 if black) Since the patient is a male, we will use the value 1.04. Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = (140 - 66) * (68 kg / 72) * (1) * (1.04) = 74 * 0.9444 * 1 = 69.7 mL/min Step 3: Round the result to the nearest whole number. Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = 70

On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

<|begin_of_thought|>Step 1: Review the patient's information to determine their BMI. The patient's height is 168.0 cm, and their weight is 68 kg. We can calculate their BMI as follows: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2 First, we need to convert the patient's height from cm to m: height (m) = 168.0 cm / 100 = 1.68 m Now we can calculate the BMI: BMI = 68 kg / (1.68 m)^2 = 68 kg / 2.8224 m^2 = 24.1 Since the patient's BMI is 24.1, which is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), we will use their actual weight as the adjusted body weight. Step 2: Use the Cockroft-Gault Equation to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance. The Cockroft-Gault Equation is as follows: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) * (weight (kg) / 72) * (0.85 if female) * (1.04 if black) Since the patient is a male, we will use the value 1.04. Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = (140 - 66) * (68 kg / 72) * (1) * (1.04) = 74 * 0.9444 * 1 = 69.7 mL/min Step 3: Round the result to the nearest whole number.

A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

<|begin_of_thought|> Step 1: Understand the given information The patient's serum glucose level is 569 mg/dL, and we need to calculate the serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg. Step 2: Convert the glucose level to osmolality To calculate the osmolality, we need to know the patient's serum sodium level, which is 133 mmol/L. We can use the following formula: Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x Sodium (mmol/L) + Glucose (mg/dL) / 18) / 1000 Step 3: Plug in the values Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x 133 mmol/L + 569 mg/dL / 18) / 1000 Step 4: Perform the calculation Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (266 + 31.72) / 1000 Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 297.72 / 1000 Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 0.29872 Step 5: Round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places Since osmolality is typically expressed in mOsm/kg, we can round the answer to 2 decimal places. Step 6: Format the answer as a JSON dictionary {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg, we used the formula: Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x Sodium (mmol/L) + Glucose (mg/dL) / 18) / 1000.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

THINKING USED  To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate the patient's eye, verbal, and motor responses. The GCS is a scale that ranges from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating better neurological function. 1. Eye Response: - Spontaneous eye opening: 4 points (1 point for each level of response) - To painful stimulus: 3 points - No response: 1 point - The patient's eyes are open upon painful stimulus, so the score for eye response is 3. 2. Verbal Response: - Oriented and converses: 5 points - Disoriented, but able to answer questions: 4 points - Inappropriate words: 3 points - Incomprehensible sounds: 2 points - No verbal response: 1 point - The patient's speech is incomprehensible, so the score for verbal response is 2. 3. Motor Response: - Obeys commands: 6 points - Localizes to pain: 5 points - Withdraws to pain: 4 points - Abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing): 3 points - Abnormal extension (decerebrate posturing): 2 points - No motor response: 1 point - The patient grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated, and she withdraws to pain, so the score for motor response is 4. Now, let's calculate the total GCS: - Eye Response: 3 - Verbal Response: 2 - Motor Response: 4 - Total GCS: 3 + 2 + 4 = 9

Add 7 days to this date: 04/09 + 7 days = 04/16/2021. Then add the cycle length of 25 days to 04/16/2021. Adding 25 days to April 16th: April has 30 days, so 30 - 16 = 14 days remaining in April. 14 + 25 = 39 days. 39 days over 30 days means 1 month and 9 days. So May 9th, plus 9 days would be May 18th. Wait, wait, let me check again. Wait, adding 25 days to April 16th: April 16 + 25 days. April has 30 days. 30 - 16 = 14 days left in April. 25 - 14 = 11 days into May. So April 16 + 25 days = May 11th. Therefore, the estimated due date is May 11, 2021. But wait, Naegele's Rule typically adds 7 days to LMP and then 9 months. However, here the cycle length is given as 25 days. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. Naegele's Rule formula is: Due Date = LMP + 7 days + 9 months. But if the cycle length is different, does that affect the calculation? Wait, no. Naegele's Rule assumes a 28-day cycle. If the cycle length is different, the rule still adds 7 days and 9 months. The cycle length might influence the calculation of the ovulation date but not the due date via Naegele's Rule. Wait, perhaps the user provided the cycle length to adjust the calculation? Or maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify. Naegele's Rule is a standard method where you take the first day of the last menstrual period, add 7 days, and then add 9 months. The cycle length isn't directly used in the rule unless it's a 28-day cycle. Since the cycle length here is 25 days, which is shorter than average, but the rule doesn't use that. So perhaps the answer is simply adding 7 days to 04/09/2021, which is 04/16/2021, then adding 9 months (which would be January 2022). Wait, no. Wait, Naegele's Rule is: Due Date = LMP + 7 days + 9 months. So starting from 04/09/2021, add 7 days: 04/16/2021. Then add 9 months: 04/16/2021 + 9 months = 01/16/2022. But the cycle length is 25 days. Does that affect anything? Wait, maybe the cycle length is used to calculate the expected ovulation date, but the due date via Naegele's Rule is fixed. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to use the cycle length to adjust the calculation. For example, some sources say that if the cycle length is longer or shorter than 28 days, you can adjust the due date by adding or subtracting days. But according to strict Naegele's Rule, the cycle length isn't factored in. Therefore, the correct approach is to apply the standard Naegele's Rule regardless of the cycle length. Hence, the due date is 01/16/2022. Wait, but let me verify this again. Let's break it down step by step. Original LMP: 04/09/2021. Add 7 days: 04/16/2021. Add 9 months: 04/16/2021 + 9 months = 01/16/2022. So the due date is January 16, 2022. However, the problem mentions the cycle length is 25 days. Is there a reason to adjust this? For instance, if the cycle length is 25 days, the average ovulation day is around 14 days after the start of the cycle. But since Naegele's Rule already accounts for 9 months, perhaps the cycle length isn't needed here. Therefore, the answer should be 01/16/2022. But wait, another way to calculate due date with cycle length: Some methods suggest adding the cycle length to the LMP and then adjusting. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, then the due date could be calculated as LMP + 25 days + 9 months. Let's try that. LMP: 04/09/2021. Add 25 days: 04/09 + 25 days. April has 30 days, so 30 - 9 = 21 days remaining in April. 25 - 21 = 4 days into May. So 04/09 + 25 days = 05/04/2021. Then add 9 months: 05/04/2021 + 9 months = 02/04/2022. But this contradicts the standard Naegele's Rule. Which approach is correct? The confusion arises because different methods exist. According to strict Naegele's Rule, the due date is LMP + 7 days + 9 months. The cycle length is not part of the calculation. However, some sources mention that if the cycle length is different from 28 days, you can adjust the due date by adding or subtracting days. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the ovulation occurs earlier, so the due date might be adjusted. But this is not part of the standard Naegele's Rule. Therefore, strictly following Naegele's Rule, the answer is 01/16/2022. However, considering possible variations, maybe the intended answer is different. Let me check an example. Suppose LMP is 04/09/2021. Adding 7 days gives 04/16/2021. Adding 9 months brings us to 01/16/2022. That's the standard answer. But if the cycle length is 25 days, perhaps the due date is calculated differently. Another approach: Some sources say that if the cycle length is different, you can use the formula: Due Date = LMP + (cycle length - 14) days + 9 months. Let's test this. Cycle length is 25 days. So (25-14)=11 days. Add 11 days to LMP: 04/09 + 11 days = 04/20/2021. Then add 9 months: 04/20/2021 + 9 months = 01/20/2022. But this is speculative. Since the problem asks to use Naegele's Rule, which doesn't involve the cycle length, the answer should be 01/16/2022. However, the problem statement mentions the cycle length, which might be a red herring or a distractor. The key is to follow the instructions precisely. The task says: "using Naegele's Rule for estimated due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length". Wait, but Naegele's Rule typically doesn't use the cycle length. It uses the first day of the LMP. So perhaps the cycle length is irrelevant here, and the answer is still 01/16/2022. Alternatively, maybe the cycle length is used to adjust the calculation. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the ovulation is earlier, so the due date might be adjusted. But without specific instructions on how to incorporate the cycle length into Naegele's Rule, it's unclear. Given the problem's wording, it's likely expecting the standard Naegele's Rule application, ignoring the cycle length. Therefore, the answer is 01/16/2022. However, to ensure accuracy, let's cross-verify with another method. Another way to calculate due date with cycle length: Some sources suggest that if the cycle length is different from 28 days, you can adjust the due date by adding or subtracting days. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the due date might be 3 days earlier than the standard Naegele's date. But this is not a standard method. Without explicit instructions on how to use the cycle length, the safest approach is to apply Naegele's Rule as per standard practice, which doesn't consider the cycle length. Therefore, the estimated due date is January 16, 2022. But wait, let's confirm with actual calculations. Let's take the LMP as April 9, 2021. Adding 7 days: April 16, 2021. Adding 9 months: January 16, 2022. Yes. So the answer is 01/16/2022. However, the problem mentions the cycle length is 25 days. Maybe the user expects us to use the cycle length to adjust the calculation. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the expected ovulation is around day 14 of the cycle. So the ovulation would be on April 23 (since 04/09 + 14 days = 04/23/2021). Then, adding 14 days for gestation (average 40 weeks), the due date would be May 7, 2021. But this is a different method (Naegele's Rule is 40 weeks from LMP). This is conflicting. The problem specifically asks to use Naegele's Rule, so the cycle length shouldn't be used here. Therefore, the answer remains 01/16/2022. But to resolve any ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects the cycle length to be used in conjunction with Naegele's Rule. For example, some sources suggest that if the cycle length is different, you can adjust the due date by adding or subtracting days. For instance, if the cycle is 25 days, the due date might be 3 days earlier. But this is not a standard approach. Given the problem's instructions, the correct answer is 01/16/2022. However, to ensure correctness, let's check online resources. According to Naegele's Rule, the due date is calculated as LMP + 7 days + 9 months. The cycle length is not part of the calculation. Therefore, the answer is January 16, 2022. But the problem provides the cycle length, which might be a trick to see if the solver ignores it. Since the task explicitly says to use Naegele's Rule, which doesn't require the cycle length, the answer is 01/16/2022. However, another perspective: Some sources mention that if the cycle length is known, you can use it to refine the calculation. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the expected ovulation is around day 14 of the cycle. Adding 14 days to LMP gives 04/23/2021. Then, adding 9 months (30 weeks) would give a due date of January 23, 2022. But this is not Naegele's Rule; it's a different method. Since the problem specifies Naegele's Rule, the cycle length is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is 01/16/2022. But to confirm, let's see: Naegele's Rule formula: Due Date = LMP + 7 days + 9 months. So 04/09/2021 + 7 days = 04/16/2021. Adding 9 months: 04/16/2021 + 9 months = 01/16/2022. Yes. Therefore, the answer is 01/16/2022. However, the problem might have intended to use the cycle length in a different way. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, the gestational age might be calculated differently. But without specific instructions, we must adhere to Naegele's Rule. Hence, the final answer is 01/16/2022. <|end_of_solution|>

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results and the task The patient's laboratory results show that her serum creatinine is 3.99 mg/dL, and we need to calculate her serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating serum osmolality Serum osmolality can be calculated using the formula: osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x sodium) + (glucose/18) + (protein/0.012) + (chloride/36.5) + (bun/2.8). Step 3: Extract the necessary values from the patient's laboratory results - Sodium: 130 mmol/L - Glucose: 83.9 mg/dL - Protein: 5.4 mg/dL - Chloride: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the anion gap calculation - Bun (BUN): 163.9 mg/dL Step 4: Estimate chloride from the anion gap calculation The anion gap can be calculated using the formula: anion gap = (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-). However, we don't have the bicarbonate level. We can estimate the bicarbonate level using the formula: HCO3- = (0.8 x (Na+ + K+)) - (Cl-). However, we don't have the potassium level. We can estimate the potassium level using the formula: K+ = (0.016 x (BUN - 10.5)). However, we don't have the BUN in mEq/L. We can estimate the BUN in mEq/L using the formula: BUN (mEq/L) = (BUN (mg/dL) / 2.8). Step 5: Calculate the estimated potassium level BUN (mg/dL) = 163.9 BUN (mEq/L) = 163.9 / 2.8 = 58.4 mEq/L K+ = (0.016 x (58.4 - 10.5)) = 0.84 mEq/L Step 6: Calculate the estimated chloride level Na+ = 130 mmol/L K+ = 0.84 mEq/L HCO3- = (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) - Cl- Cl- = (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) - (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) = 104 mmol/L Step 7: Calculate the estimated osmolality Sodium: 130 mmol/L Glucose: 83.9 mg/dL Protein: 5.4 mg/dL Chloride: 104 mmol/L Bun: 163.9 mg/dL osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x 130) + (83.9/18) + (5.4/0.012) + (104/36.5) + (163.9/2.8) = 260 + 4.65 + 450 + 2.84 + 58.25 = 775.74 mOsm/kg <end> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's serum osmolality can be calculated using the formula: osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x sodium) + (glucose/18) + (protein/0.012) + (chloride/36.5) + (bun/2.8).

<|begin_of_thought|> Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results and the task The patient's laboratory results show that her serum creatinine is 3.99 mg/dL, and we need to calculate her serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating serum osmolality Serum osmolality can be calculated using the formula: osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x sodium) + (glucose/18) + (protein/0.012) + (chloride/36.5) + (bun/2.8). Step 3: Extract the necessary values from the patient's laboratory results - Sodium: 130 mmol/L - Glucose: 83.9 mg/dL - Protein: 5.4 mg/dL - Chloride: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the anion gap calculation - Bun (BUN): 163.9 mg/dL Step 4: Estimate chloride from the anion gap calculation The anion gap can be calculated using the formula: anion gap = (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-). However, we don't have the bicarbonate level. We can estimate the bicarbonate level using the formula: HCO3- = (0.8 x (Na+ + K+)) - (Cl-). However, we don't have the potassium level. We can estimate the potassium level using the formula: K+ = (0.016 x (BUN - 10.5)). However, we don't have the BUN in mEq/L. We can estimate the BUN in mEq/L using the formula: BUN (mEq/L) = (BUN (mg/dL) / 2.8). Step 5: Calculate the estimated potassium level BUN (mg/dL) = 163.9 BUN (mEq/L) = 163.9 / 2.8 = 58.4 mEq/L K+ = (0.016 x (58.4 - 10.5)) = 0.84 mEq/L Step 6: Calculate the estimated chloride level Na+ = 130 mmol/L K+ = 0.84 mEq/L HCO3- = (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) - Cl- Cl- = (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) - (0.8 x (130 + 0.84)) = 104 mmol/L Step 7: Calculate the estimated osmolality Sodium: 130 mmol/L Glucose: 83.9 mg/dL Protein: 5.4 mg/dL Chloride: 104 mmol/L Bun: 163.9 mg/dL osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x 130) + (83.9/18) + (5.4/0.012) + (104/36.5) + (163.9/2.8) = 260 + 4.65 + 450 + 2.84 + 58.25 = 775.74 mOsm/kg <end> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's serum osmolality can be calculated using the formula: osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x sodium) + (glucose/18) + (protein/0.012) + (chloride/36.5) + (bun/2.8).

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

THINKING USED Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant information. The patient's weight is 30 kg, and we need to calculate the maintenance fluid in mL/hr. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating maintenance fluid. The formula for calculating maintenance fluid is: Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (body weight (kg) x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr. Step 3: Plug in the patient's weight into the formula. Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (30 kg x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr = 1250 mL/hr. Step 4: Convert the result to a more meaningful unit if necessary. No conversion is necessary in this case. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's maintenance fluid is calculated by multiplying their weight in kg by 1000 mL/kg and then dividing by 24 hours.

Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating maintenance fluid. The formula for calculating maintenance fluid is: Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (body weight (kg) x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr. Step 3: Plug in the patient's weight into the formula. Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (30 kg x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr = 1250 mL/hr. Step 4: Convert the result to a more meaningful unit if necessary. No conversion is necessary in this case. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's maintenance fluid is calculated by multiplying their weight in kg by 1000 mL/kg and then dividing by 24 hours.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene). The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2. At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL). The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support. On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out. After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

Ascites wasn't explicitly mentioned but since the patient has severe encephalopathy (stage 3-4), ascites is likely present (Child-Pugh C requires both). Encephalopathy stage 3-4 corresponds to 4 points. Albumin <3.5 g/dL gives 1 point. Bilirubin >3 mg/dL would be 3 points, but here it's 1.9, so 0 points. INR 1.6 is within normal range (1.2-1.4 is A, 1.5-2.0 B, >2.0 C), so 0 points. Adding up: 0 (bilirubin) + 1 (albumin) + 0 (INR) + 4 (encephalopathy) + 0 (ascites) = 5.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication. On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable. Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time. An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery. An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis. A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis. Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril). At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to use the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)². First, we need to convert the patient's weight and height from the given units to metric units. The patient's weight is 42 kg and the height is 145 cm. To convert the height to meters, we divide by 100: 145 cm / 100 = 1.45 m. Next, we plug these values into the BMI formula: BMI = 42 kg / (1.45 m)². Now, we calculate the square of the height: (1.45 m)² = 2.1025 m². Finally, we divide the weight by the squared height: BMI = 42 kg / 2.1025 m² = 20.0 kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?

THINKING USED  To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin level, bilirubin level, INR (International Normalized Ratio), prothrombin time, and ascites. The score ranges from 5 to 15, with higher scores indicating more severe liver disease. 1. Albumin level: The patient's albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL corresponds to 1 point. 2. Bilirubin level: The patient's total bilirubin count is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, a bilirubin level of 1.9 mg/dL corresponds to 1 point. 3. INR: The patient's INR value is 1.8. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, an INR of 1.8 corresponds to 1 point. 4. Prothrombin time: The prothrombin time is not mentioned in the note, but it is assumed to be within normal bounds since the INR is 1.8, which is within the normal range for most patients. 5. Ascites: The note does not mention ascites, so we assume it is absent. Now, let's calculate the total Child-Pugh Score: 1 (albumin) + 1 (bilirubin) + 1 (INR) = 3 The Child-Pugh Score ranges from 5 to 15, so the patient's score is 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

What is the patient's HEART score?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED  To calculate the HEART score, we need to evaluate the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. The HEART score is a tool used to diagnose Brugada syndrome, which is characterized by specific ECG patterns. The acronym HEART stands for High-Rose T wave, Early repolarization, Arrhythmia, Right bundle branch block, and T wave inversion in leads V1-V3. The patient's ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads, isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL, and a right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. However, the key finding that points towards Brugada syndrome is the presence of ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3, which is a hallmark of the condition. The patient also had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which are arrhythmias that can be associated with Brugada syndrome. However, the absence of a coved-type ECG pattern during the ajmaline challenge test makes it less likely to be a definitive diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. Despite this, the patient's ECG findings and history of arrhythmias suggest that the patient may have a condition that shares some similarities with Brugada syndrome. However, the HEART score is not a widely used or established tool for diagnosing Brugada syndrome, and its application in this case is not clear. Therefore, based on the provided information, I will assign a score of 0 to the patient's HEART score, as the diagnostic criteria for Brugada syndrome are not fully met.

He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

<|begin_of_thought|> To calculate the HEART score, we need to evaluate the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. The HEART score is a tool used to diagnose Brugada syndrome, which is characterized by specific ECG patterns. The acronym HEART stands for High-Rose T wave, Early repolarization, Arrhythmia, Right bundle branch block, and T wave inversion in leads V1-V3. The patient's ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads, isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL, and a right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. However, the key finding that points towards Brugada syndrome is the presence of ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3, which is a hallmark of the condition. The patient also had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which are arrhythmias that can be associated with Brugada syndrome. However, the absence of a coved-type ECG pattern during the ajmaline challenge test makes it less likely to be a definitive diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. Despite this, the patient's ECG findings and history of arrhythmias suggest that the patient may have a condition that shares some similarities with Brugada syndrome. However, the HEART score is not a widely used or established tool for diagnosing Brugada syndrome, and its application in this case is not clear. Therefore, based on the provided information, I will assign a score of 0 to the patient's HEART score, as the diagnostic criteria for Brugada syndrome are not fully met. <|end_of_thought|><|begin_of_solution|>

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes.

 Here is the patient note:
A 58-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following the deterioration of his conscious state; currently, he is rated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10. He is presently on mechanical ventilation, with FiO₂ at 54 %, and his arterial blood gas shows a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. Furthermore, there are ongoing infusions of multiple vasopressors to maintain his hemodynamic stability, including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. His systolic and diastolic blood pressure recorded at 120 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg, respectively. Biochemical findings show creatinine measurement at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function, while the bilirubin level stood at 2.3 mg/dL. His platelet count is 175,000/µL. Over the past 24-hours, his urine output was 850 mL/day.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we need to evaluate the patient's status in six different organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological. The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more organ dysfunction. 1. Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which indicates respiratory failure. We will assign 2 points for this organ system. 2. Cardiovascular: The patient is on multiple vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic stability, indicating cardiovascular instability. We will assign 2 points for this organ system. 3. Hepatic: The patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, which is elevated. We will assign 1 point for this organ system. 4. Coagulation: The patient's platelet count is 175,000/µL, which is slightly low. We will assign 1 point for this organ system. 5. Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function. We will assign 1 point for this organ system. 6. Neurological: The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score is 10, indicating severe brain injury. We will assign 4 points for this organ system. Now, let's calculate the total SOFA score by adding the points for each organ system: 2 (respiratory) + 2 (cardiovascular) + 1 (hepatic) + 1 (coagulation) + 1 (renal) + 4 (neurological) = 11.

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to use the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)². First, we need to convert the patient's height from centimeters to meters. The patient's height is 156 cm, so we divide it by 100 to get the height in meters: 156 cm / 100 = 1.56 m. Next, we need to convert the patient's weight from kilograms to a numerical value. The patient's weight is 44 kg. Now we can plug these values into the BMI formula: BMI = 44 kg / (1.56 m)². Performing the calculation: BMI = 44 kg / 2.4336 m² = 18.02 kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

THINKING USED  To determine the patient's score on Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, we need to evaluate the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. The Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism include the following points: 1. Clinical signs of DVT (1 point) 2. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE (1 point) 3. Heart rate > 100 (1 point) 4. Immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity (1 point) 5. Previous DVT or PE (1 point) 6. Hemoptysis (1 point) 7. Malignancy (1 point) 8. Positive chest X-ray (1 point) 9. Blood tests showing D-dimer > 0.5 μg/L (1 point) 10. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE (1 point) Now, let's evaluate the patient's clinical findings: 1. Clinical signs of DVT: No mention of DVT or symptoms of DVT. 2. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: The patient has a mediastinal mass and a type B dissection, which makes PE a likely diagnosis. 3. Heart rate > 100: The patient's resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute, so this criterion is not met. 4. Immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity: No mention of immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity. 5. Previous DVT or PE: No mention of previous DVT or PE. 6. Hemoptysis: No mention of hemoptysis. 7. Malignancy: No mention of malignancy. 8. Positive chest X-ray: The chest X-ray showed a mediastinal mass, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. 9. Blood tests showing D-dimer > 0.5 μg/L: No mention of blood tests or D-dimer levels. 10. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: As mentioned earlier, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings make PE a likely diagnosis. Based on the evaluation, the patient scores 3 points out of 10 on the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism.

Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

Immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity (1 point) 5. Previous DVT or PE (1 point) 6. Hemoptysis (1 point) 7. Malignancy (1 point) 8. Positive chest X-ray (1 point) 9. Blood tests showing D-dimer > 0.5 μg/L (1 point) 10. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE (1 point) Now, let's evaluate the patient's clinical findings: 1. Clinical signs of DVT: No mention of DVT or symptoms of DVT. 2. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: The patient has a mediastinal mass and a type B dissection, which makes PE a likely diagnosis. 3. Heart rate > 100: The patient's resting pulse is under 60 beats per minute, so this criterion is not met. 4. Immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity: No mention of immobility or paralysis of a lower extremity. 5. Previous DVT or PE: No mention of previous DVT or PE. 6. Hemoptysis: No mention of hemoptysis. 7. Malignancy: No mention of malignancy. 8. Positive chest X-ray: The chest X-ray showed a mediastinal mass, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. 9. Blood tests showing D-dimer > 0.5 μg/L: No mention of blood tests or D-dimer levels. 10. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: As mentioned earlier, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings make PE a likely diagnosis.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a known history of cirrhosis due to chronic Hepatitis B infection. Upon clinical examination, he has jaundice and his abdomen is moderately distended with a noticeable fluid wave on palpation, indicating moderate ascites. He has been experiencing episodes of short-term memory loss and confusion, consistent with grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. His laboratory results reflected impaired coagulation status given INR of 1.9. Overall liver function tests showed albumin level of 2.8 g/dL and total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL. His hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL, and other routine biochemical parameters were within acceptable range. His medication list includes diuretics, lactulose, and antiviral agents for ongoing Hepatitis B infection. The patient and his family have been advised to monitor his cognitive function at home and relay any further deterioration.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results The patient's serum albumin level is 1.2 g/dL, and the normal range for albumin is 3.4-4.2 g/dL. To calculate the albumin corrected delta gap, we need to first calculate the albumin level in mEq/L. Step 2: Convert albumin level from g/dL to mEq/L 1.2 g/dL x (1 L / 1000 mL) x (1 mol/L / 18.01 g) = 0.0667 mol/L Since albumin is a negatively charged molecule, we need to multiply by -1 to get the mEq/L value. -0.0667 mol/L x -1 = 0.0667 mEq/L Step 3: Calculate the albumin corrected delta gap The albumin corrected delta gap is calculated by subtracting the patient's albumin level from the upper limit of the normal range and dividing by 2. Albumin corrected delta gap = (4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL) / 2 = 1.5 g/dL / 18.01 g/mol = 0.083 mEq/L Step 4: Convert the albumin corrected delta gap to mEq/L Since 1 g/dL is equal to 1 mol/L, the albumin corrected delta gap is already in mEq/L.

Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.

Step 2: Convert albumin level from g/dL to mEq/L 1.2 g/dL x (1 L / 1000 mL) x (1 mol/L / 18.01 g) = 0.0667 mol/L Since albumin is a negatively charged molecule, we need to multiply by -1 to get the mEq/L value. -0.0667 mol/L x -1 = 0.0667 mEq/L Step 3: Calculate the albumin corrected delta gap The albumin corrected delta gap is calculated by subtracting the patient\'s albumin level from the upper limit of the normal range and dividing by 2. Albumin corrected delta gap = (4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL) / 2 = 1.5 g/dL / 18.01 g/mol = 0.083 mEq/L Step 4: Convert the albumin corrected delta gap to mEq/L Since 1 g/dL is equal to 1 mol/L, the albumin corrected delta gap is already in mEq/L.

Then, we calculated the albumin corrected delta gap by subtracting the patient's albumin level from the upper limit of the normal range and dividing by 2. The result is 0.083 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

{'Row Number': 261, 'Calculator Name': 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Calculator ID': '18', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8509094-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.\nThree months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\nIn addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).\nOf note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.', 'Question': "What is the patient's HEART score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '3', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " Step 1: Review the patient's medical history and current presentation to identify the key factors that contribute to the HEART score.
