 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. The components of the HAS-BLED score are: - H (Hypertension): Controlled or uncontrolled hypertension. - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function): Abnormal renal or liver function. - S (Stroke): Previous stroke. - B (Bleeding): Previous history of bleeding. - L (Labile INR): Labile international normalized ratio (INR). - E (Elderly): Age > 65 years. - D (Drugs/Alcohol): Concomitant use of drugs or alcohol. Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has well-documented uncontrolled hypertension. This gives 1 point. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function):** The patient has hepatic impairment due to ALD (alcoholic liver disease) and an elevated creatinine with a reduced glomerular filtration rate, indicating abnormal renal function. This gives 1 point. 3. **S (Stroke):** There is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. This gives 0 points. 4. **B (Bleeding):** The patient has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding, and his coagulation profiles are stable with a consistently normal INR. There is no mention of a previous history of bleeding. This gives 0 points. 5. **L (Labile INR):** The patient's INR is consistently normal. This gives 0 points. 6. **E (Elderly):** The patient is 72 years old, which is over 65 years. This gives 1 point. 7. **D (Drugs/Alcohol):** The patient admits to consuming alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. This indicates alcohol use, which gives 1 point. Now, let's add up the points from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function): 1 point - S (Stroke): 0 points - B (Bleeding): 0 points - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Elderly): 1 point - D (Drugs/Alcohol): 1 point Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4 points. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The key factors required for the calculation include age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. From the patient note, we have the following information: - Age: 50 years old. - Sex: Male. - Smoking history: 3-pack year smoking history (implies he is a smoker). - Blood pressure: 131/83 mm Hg (systolic BP = 131 mm Hg). - No history of hypertension (no treatment for hypertension mentioned). - Cholesterol information: LDL = 107 mg/dL, HDL = 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides = 98 mg/dL. However, the Framingham Risk Score requires total cholesterol, not just LDL and HDL. Since the total cholesterol is not directly provided, we can estimate it using the formula: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5) Using the given values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + 19.6 Total Cholesterol ≈ 169.6 mg/dL Now we have the following data for the Framingham Risk Score calculation: - Age: 50 years. - Sex: Male. - Total Cholesterol: 169.6 mg/dL. - HDL: 43 mg/dL. - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg. - Treatment for hypertension: No. - Smoking status: Yes (since he has a 3-pack year smoking history, which indicates he is a smoker). Now, we will use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men: The formula involves calculating points for each risk factor and summing them up. Here are the steps: 1. **Age:** - For a 50-year-old male, the points for age are found in the age category. - From the Framingham Risk Score tables, the points for age 50 are 9. 2. **Total Cholesterol:** - Total Cholesterol = 169.6 mg/dL. - From the total cholesterol categories: - 160-199 mg/dL corresponds to 4 points. - Since 169.6 falls within the range 160-199 mg/dL, the points for total cholesterol are 4. 3. **HDL Cholesterol:** - HDL = 43 mg/dL. - From the HDL categories: - 35-39 mg/dL = 3 points. - 40-44 mg/dL = 2 points. - Since 43 mg/dL falls within the range 40-44 mg/dL, the points for HDL are 2. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure:** - Systolic BP = 131 mm Hg. - Since the patient is not on treatment for hypertension, we use the systolic BP categories for untreated hypertension. - From the systolic BP categories for untreated hypertension: - 130-139 mm Hg = 3 points. - Since 131 mm Hg falls within the range 130-139 mm Hg, the points for systolic BP are 3. 5. **Smoking Status:** - The patient is a smoker. - From the smoking status categories: - Current smoker = 2 points. - Therefore, the points for smoking status are 2. Now, we sum up all the points: Points for age = 9 Points for total cholesterol = 4 Points for HDL = 2 Points for systolic BP = 3 Points for smoking status = 2 Total points = 9 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 20 Using the total points (20), we can find the corresponding 10-year risk of CHD from the Framingham Risk Score table for men. For a total score of 20, the 10-year risk of CHD is approximately 10%. Thus, the patient's Framingham Risk Score corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 10%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need the following information: age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status.

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL.

Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the given information from the patient note: - Age: 60 years old. - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 14. - Body Temperature: 37.2°C. - Heart rate: 95 bpm. - Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute. - Blood pressure: 135/75 mm Hg. - White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 12,000 per µL. - Sodium: 138 mEq/L. - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L. - Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL. - Hematocrit: 43%. - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): pH = 7.32, FiO₂ = 55%, A-a gradient = 364. Step 2: Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): The formula for MAP is: MAP = (2 * Diastolic BP + Systolic BP) / 3. Using the given blood pressure of 135/75 mm Hg: MAP = (2 * 75 + 135) / 3 = (150 + 135) / 3 = 285 / 3 = 95 mm Hg. Step 3: Calculate the APACHE II score using the given parameters and their corresponding scores from the APACHE II scoring system. Let's calculate each component one by one: 1. Age: - The patient is 60 years old. - The APACHE II scoring for age is as follows: - 15-44 years: 0 points - 45-54 years: 1 point - 55-64 years: 2 points - 65-74 years: 3 points - 75-84 years: 4 points - >84 years: 5 points Since the patient is 60 years old, the score for age is 2 points. 2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): - The patient has a GCS of 14. - The APACHE II scoring for GCS is as follows: - 15: 0 points - 14: 1 point - 13: 1 point - 12: 2 points - 11: 2 points - 10: 3 points - 9: 3 points - 8: 4 points - 7: 4 points - 6: 5 points - 5: 5 points - 4: 6 points - 3: 6 points - 2: 7 points - 1: 7 points For a GCS of 14, the score is 1 point. 3. Body Temperature: - The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. - The APACHE II scoring for body temperature is as follows: - <35°C: 2 points - 35-38.4°C: 0 points - >38.4°C: 1 point Since the temperature is 37.2°C, which falls within the range of 35-38.4°C, the score is 0 points. 4. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): - We calculated the MAP to be 95 mm Hg. - The APACHE II scoring for MAP is as follows: - <70 mm Hg: 3 points - 70-79 mm Hg: 2 points - 80-89 mm Hg: 1 point - 90-109 mm Hg: 0 points - 110-119 mm Hg: 1 point - 120-129 mm Hg: 2 points - ≥130 mm Hg: 3 points Since the MAP is 95 mm Hg, which falls within the range of 90-109 mm Hg, the score is 0 points. 5. Respiratory component: We have the respiratory rate (RR) and the arterial blood gas information (pH and FiO₂). The APACHE II scoring for the respiratory component can be based on either the PaCO₂ or the respiratory rate if PaCO₂ is not available. Since we have the pH and FiO₂, we can use the A-a gradient to infer the respiratory status. However, the APACHE II score typically uses PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio or PaCO₂ for respiratory function. Let's calculate the PaO₂ using the given information. The A-a gradient is given as 364. The formula for the A-a gradient is: A-a gradient = PaO₂ (alveolar) - PaO₂ (arterial). To find PaO₂, we need more information. Let's use the given FiO₂ and the pH to calculate the respiratory score indirectly. Since the pH is 7.32 and the FiO₂ is 55%, we will use the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio if we can estimate PaO₂. The A-a gradient formula is: A-a gradient = (PB - 47) * FiO₂ - PaCO₂ / R - PaO₂ where PB is the barometric pressure (usually taken as 760 mm Hg at sea level), and R is the respiratory quotient (usually taken as 0.8). However, this is quite complex without additional information like PaCO₂. Alternatively, we can use the respiratory rate as a proxy if we don't have PaO₂. The APACHE II scoring for respiratory rate is as follows: - <12 breaths/min: 1 point - 12-29 breaths/min: 0 points - ≥30 breaths/min: 1 point Since the respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which falls within the range of 12-29 breaths/min, the score is 0 points. If we use the pH to determine the respiratory component, the APACHE II scoring for pH is as follows: - pH < 7.30: 3 points - 7.30-7.39: 1 point - 7.40-7.44: 0 points - 7.45-7.49: 1 point - pH ≥ 7.50: 2 points Since the pH is 7.32, which falls within the range of 7.30-7.39, the score is 1 point. Let's use the pH score for the respiratory component since it seems more relevant given the information provided. So the respiratory score is 1 point. 6. White Blood Cell (WBC) count: - The WBC count is 12,000 per µL. - The APACHE II scoring for WBC is as follows: - <4,000/µL or >12,000/µL: 1 point - 4,000-12,000/µL: 0 points Since the WBC count is 12,000 per µL, which is exactly on the upper limit, the score is 1 point. 7. Serum Sodium: - The sodium level is 138 mEq/L. - The APACHE II scoring for serum sodium is as follows: - <120 mEq/L: 4 points - 120-129 mEq/L: 3 points - 130-144 mEq/L: 0 points - 145-149 mEq/L: 1 point - ≥150 mEq/L: 2 points Since the sodium level is 138 mEq/L, which falls within the range of 130-144 mEq/L, the score is 0 points. 8. Serum Potassium: - The potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L. - The APACHE II scoring for serum potassium is as follows: - <3.0 mEq/L: 3 points - 3.0-3.4 mEq/L: 2 points - 3.5-5.4 mEq/L: 0 points - 5.5-5.9 mEq/L: 1 point - ≥6.0 mEq/L: 2 points Since the potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, which falls within the range of 3.5-5.4 mEq/L, the score is 0 points. 9.

The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative. Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 55.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 364. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Step 1: Convert the patient's height from inches to meters. The patient's height is 77 inches. We know that 1 inch = 0.0254 meters. So, the height in meters is: \[ \text{Height in meters} = 77 \times 0.0254 \] Let's calculate this: \[ \text{Height in meters} = 77 \times 0.0254 = 1.9558 \, \text{meters} \] Step 2: Use the formula for BMI to find the target weight. The formula for BMI is: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}} \] Rearranging this formula to solve for the weight gives us: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2 \] We know the target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2 and the height in meters is 1.9558 m. So we plug these values into the formula: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = 19.7 \times (1.9558)^2 \] First, calculate the square of the height: \[ (1.9558)^2 = 3.82509364 \] Now, multiply this result by the target BMI (19.7): \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = 19.7 \times 3.82509364 \] Let's do the multiplication: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} \approx 19.7 \times 3.82509364 \approx 75.5433 \] Rounding to a reasonable precision, the target weight is approximately 75.54 kg. So the patient's target weight in kg is approximately 75.54 kg. The final answer is approximately 75.54 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the target weight, we first convert the patient's height from inches to meters. The height is 77 inches.

Rearranging this to find the weight gives us Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height (m))^2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly. It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney. A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease. On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity. The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up. Here is the task: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need the following information: - Serum creatinine level - Patient's age - Patient's sex From the patient note, we have the following information: - Serum creatinine level: 8.9 mg/dL - The patient is a 38-year-old female. The 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for females is: \[ \text{GFR (mL/min/1.73 m}^2\text{)} = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Serum Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \] Let's plug in the values step-by-step. 1. The serum creatinine level is 8.9 mg/dL. 2. The patient's age is 38 years. 3. The patient is female. Now, let's use the formula: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{38}. \] Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\). \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.7143. \] Step 2: Calculate \(\left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329}\), which is \(12.7143^{-0.329}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 12.7143^{-0.329} \approx 0.457. \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.993^{38}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.911. \] Now, we can plug these values back into the GFR formula: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times 0.457 \times 0.911. \] Step 4: First, multiply 144 by 0.457: \[ 144 \times 0.457 \approx 65.808. \] Step 5: Now, multiply the result by 0.911: \[ 65.808 \times 0.911 \approx 59.85. \] So, the estimated GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation is approximately 59.85 mL/min/1.73 m². Since we typically round to the nearest whole number for GFR, the GFR is approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m². However, let's check if there was any mistake because the serum creatinine level is quite high (8.9 mg/dL), which suggests very poor kidney function and should result in a very low GFR. Let's re-calculate step-by-step more carefully. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{8.9}{0.7}.\) \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.7143. \] Step 2: Calculate \(\left(12.7143\right)^{-0.329}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 12.7143^{-0.329} \approx 0.457. \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.993^{38}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.911. \] Now, multiply these values together with 144: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times 0.457 \times 0.911. \] First, calculate \(144 \times 0.457\): \[ 144 \times 0.457 \approx 65.808. \] Then multiply the result by 0.911: \[ 65.808 \times 0.911 \approx 59.85. \] It seems the calculation is consistent and gives us approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m². But given the very high serum creatinine level (8.9 mg/dL), this seems unusually high for such a severe kidney dysfunction. Let's use an alternative approach by using the CKD-EPI equation for very high creatinine levels. For very high serum creatinine levels, the CKD-EPI equation simplifies differently. The CKD-EPI equation for creatinine levels above a certain threshold can be approximated differently. For females: If the serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, the formula is: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Serum Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}}. \] But for very high creatinine levels, the GFR can be very low and might approach zero. Let's use the CKD-EPI equation for creatinine levels above 0.7 mg/dL and calculate it again step-by-step. \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{38}. \] We already calculated: \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.7143. \] Now, calculate \(\left(12.7143\right)^{-0.329}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 12.7143^{-0.329} \approx 0.457. \] And we have already calculated: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.911. \] So, \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times 0.457 \times 0.911. \] Now multiply step-by-step: \[ 144 \times 0.457 \approx 65.808, \] and then \[ 65.808 \times 0.911 \approx 59.85. \] This gives us approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m². It seems there is a discrepancy because the serum creatinine level is extremely high (8.9 mg/dL), which suggests that the GFR should be very low. Let's use the CKD-EPI equation for very high creatinine levels directly. For very high creatinine levels, the GFR is often very low and can be approximated to be near zero. Given the very high serum creatinine level (8.9 mg/dL), the GFR is likely to be very low. Let's use the CKD-EPI equation for creatinine levels above 0.7 mg/dL and simplify it further. The formula is: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Serum Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}}. \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{8.9}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{38}. \] We already calculated: \[ \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.7143. \] Now calculate \(\left(12.7143\right)^{-0.329}.\) Using a calculator: \[ \left(12.7143\right)^{-0.329} \approx 0.457. \] And we have: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.911. \] So, \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times 0.457 \times 0.911. \] Now multiply step-by-step: \[ 144 \times 0.457 \approx 65.808, \] and \[ 65.808 \times 0.911 \approx 59.85. \] This gives us approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m². It seems the calculation is consistent. Given the context of the patient's condition (anuria and severe renal failure), the GFR should be very low. The high serum creatinine level (8.9 mg/dL) suggests that the kidneys are not functioning well. Let's use an alternative approach to estimate the GFR for very high creatinine levels. For very high creatinine levels, the GFR is often estimated to be very low, close to zero. Given the patient's anuria (no urine output), the GFR is likely to be extremely low, close to 0 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the correct GFR for this patient is likely to be very low, close to 0. So the final answer is approximately 0 mL/min/1.73 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need the serum creatinine level, the patient's age, and the patient's sex.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints. The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma (). Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer. Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months. Here is the task: What is the patient's FeverPAIN score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the FeverPAIN score for this patient, we need to evaluate the patient's symptoms and findings according to the FeverPAIN scoring system. The FeverPAIN score is used to assess the severity of suspected gastrointestinal (GI) tract injury after ingestion of a caustic substance. The components of the FeverPAIN score are: - Fever - Pain - Age - Interval between ingestion and endoscopy - Nausea and vomiting - Endoscopic findings Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Fever**: The patient's temperature is not explicitly mentioned in the note. Therefore, we will assume that there is no fever unless stated otherwise. If the patient does not have a fever, this component scores 0. 2. **Pain**: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting but did not report severe abdominal pain upon arrival. The note mentions that the patient felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat and experienced nausea and vomiting. However, the patient was in no acute distress upon arrival and did not have significant abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Therefore, we can assume that the pain component is not severe. Since the patient did not report severe abdominal pain, this component scores 0. 3. **Age**: The patient is 77 years old. According to the FeverPAIN scoring system, if the age is greater than or equal to 60 years, this component scores 1. Since the patient is 77 years old, this component scores 1. 4. **Interval between ingestion and endoscopy**: The patient accidentally ingested the hydrogen peroxide approximately 90 minutes before arrival. The time from ingestion to endoscopy is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that the endoscopy was performed after the patient was transferred to the tertiary care hospital. Let's assume the endoscopy was performed within a few hours after ingestion. If the interval between ingestion and endoscopy is less than 24 hours, this component scores 0. Since the endoscopy was performed relatively soon after the ingestion, this component scores 0. 5. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient experienced nausea and vomiting immediately after ingestion, which is consistent with the symptoms of caustic ingestion. This component scores 1. 6. **Endoscopic findings**: The endoscopy performed at the tertiary care hospital revealed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis. These findings indicate significant injury to the esophagus and stomach. According to the FeverPAIN scoring system, if there is evidence of esophageal or gastric injury on endoscopy, this component scores 1. Therefore, this component scores 1. Now let's sum up the scores for each component: - Fever: 0 - Pain: 0 - Age (≥ 60 years): 1 - Interval between ingestion and endoscopy (< 24 hours): 0 - Nausea and vomiting: 1 - Endoscopic findings (esophageal or gastric injury): 1 Adding these up: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. Therefore, the patient's FeverPAIN score is 3. The JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components:\n\n1. **Fever**: The patient's temperature is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we assume no fever, scoring 0.\n2. **Pain**: The patient did not report severe abdominal pain, scoring 0.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 77 years old, which is >= 60 years, so this scores 1.\n4. **Interval between ingestion and endoscopy**: The endoscopy was performed relatively soon after ingestion (within a few hours), scoring 0.\n5. **Nausea and vomiting**: The patient experienced nausea and vomiting, scoring 1.\n6. **Endoscopic findings**: The endoscopy showed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis, indicating injury, scoring 1.\n\nNow, summing up the scores: 0 (Fever) + 0 (Pain) + 1 (Age) + 0 (Interval) + 1 (Nausea and vomiting) + 1 (Endoscopic findings) = 3.\nTherefore, the FeverPAIN score is 3.", "answer": "3"}

The Bazett formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where QT is the QT interval in milliseconds (msec), and RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (which is the inverse of the heart rate in seconds). Given: - The patient's heart rate is 46 bpm (beats per minute). - The QT interval is 330 msec. First, we need to convert the heart rate to the RR interval in seconds.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus. Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome. Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases. It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

The patient's height is 160 cm and weight is 56.8 kg. The formula for adjusted body weight is typically used in the context of calculating medication dosages and is often used for patients who are either overweight or underweight. The formula for adjusted body weight is: Adjusted Body Weight = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight) To use this formula, we first need to calculate the ideal body weight. The ideal body weight for men can be calculated using the following formula: Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch above 5 feet. However, since the height is given in centimeters, we should convert the height to inches first. 1 inch = 2.54 cm. So, the patient's height in inches is: \[ \text{Height in inches} = \frac{160 \, \text{cm}}{2.54 \, \text{cm/inch}} \approx 62.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Since the ideal body weight formula uses height in inches and starts from 5 feet (which is 60 inches), we need to calculate how many inches above 5 feet the patient is: \[ \text{Inches above 5 feet} = 62.99 \, \text{inches} - 60 \, \text{inches} = 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Now we can calculate the ideal body weight using the formula: \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight (IBW)} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Let's calculate this step by step: \[ 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches} \approx 6.877 \, \text{kg}. \] So, \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight (IBW)} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 6.877 \, \text{kg} \approx 56.877 \, \text{kg}. \] Now we have the ideal body weight (approximately 56.877 kg) and the actual body weight (56.8 kg). We will use the adjusted body weight formula: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = \text{Ideal Body Weight} + 0.4 * (\text{Actual Body Weight} - \text{Ideal Body Weight}). \] Substitute the values we have: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = 56.877 \, \text{kg} + 0.4 * (56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg}). \] Calculate the difference between the actual body weight and the ideal body weight: \[ 56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg} = -0.077 \, \text{kg}. \] Now multiply this difference by 0.4: \[ 0.4 * (-0.077 \, \text{kg}) = -0.0308 \, \text{kg}. \] Now add this result to the ideal body weight: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = 56.877 \, \text{kg} + (-0.0308 \, \text{kg}) = 56.877 \, \text{kg} - 0.0308 \, \text{kg} \approx 56.8462 \, \text{kg}. \] Rounded to a reasonable precision, the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.85 kg. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Convert the patient's height from cm to inches: \( \frac{160 \, \text{cm}}{2.54 \, \text{cm/inch}} \approx 62.99 \, \text{inches}. \) 2. Calculate how many inches above 5 feet (60 inches) the patient is: \( 62.99 \, \text{inches} - 60 \, \text{inches} = 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \) 3. Use the ideal body weight formula for men: \( \text{Ideal Body Weight} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \) 4. Calculate \( 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches} \approx 6.877 \, \text{kg}. \) 5. Therefore, the ideal body weight is \( 50 \, \text{kg} + 6.877 \, \text{kg} \approx 56.877 \, \text{kg}. \) 6. Use the adjusted body weight formula: \( \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = \text{Ideal Body Weight} + 0.4 * (\text{Actual Body Weight} - \text{Ideal Body Weight}). \) 7. Substitute the values: \( \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = 56.877 \, \text{kg} + 0.4 * (56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg}). \) 8. Calculate the difference between the actual and ideal body weights: \( 56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg} = -0.077 \, \text{kg}. \) 9. Multiply this difference by 0.4: \( 0.4 * (-0.077 \, \text{kg}) = -0.0308 \, \text{kg}. \) 10. Add this result to the ideal body weight: \( 56.877 \, \text{kg} + (-0.0308 \, \text{kg}) = 56.8462 \, \text{kg}, \) which rounds to approximately 56.85 kg. Thus, the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.85 kg. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's adjusted body weight, we first convert the height from cm to inches: 160 cm / 2.54 cm/inch ≈ 62.99 inches.

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.\nThe patient had no medical history of past illness.\nThe patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.\nThe height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively.

Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.\nOn March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung.

Step 1: Identify the LMP and cycle length. The LMP is 02/08/2024. The cycle length is 25 days. Step 2: Understand that conception typically occurs around ovulation. Ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. For a cycle of 25 days, ovulation would occur approximately 25 - 14 = 11 days after the LMP. So, we need to calculate the date that is 11 days after the LMP (February 8, 2024). Step 3: Add 11 days to the LMP (February 8, 2024). Let's calculate this step-by-step: - February 8, 2024 + 1 day = February 9, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 2 days = February 10, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 3 days = February 11, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 4 days = February 12, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 5 days = February 13, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 6 days = February 14, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 7 days = February 15, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 8 days = February 16, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 9 days = February 17, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 10 days = February 18, 2024 - February 8, 2024 + 11 days = February 19, 2024 So, 11 days after February 8, 2024 is February 19, 2024.

Step 1: Convert OxyCODONE to MME. - The conversion factor for OxyCODONE to MME is 1.5. This means that 1 mg of OxyCODONE is equivalent to 1.5 mg of Morphine. - The patient takes 60 mg of OxyCODONE 1 time a day. - Therefore, the MME for OxyCODONE is: \( 60 \, \text{mg} \times 1.5 = 90 \, \text{MME} \). Step 2: Convert HYDROmorphone to MME. - The conversion factor for HYDROmorphone to MME is 4. This means that 1 mg of HYDROmorphone is equivalent to 4 mg of Morphine. - The patient takes 70 mg of HYDROmorphone 2 times a day. - Therefore, the total daily dose of HYDROmorphone is \( 70 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 140 \, \text{mg/day} \). - The MME for HYDROmorphone is: \( 140 \, \text{mg} \times 4 = 560 \, \text{MME} \). Step 3: Convert Codeine to MME. - The conversion factor for Codeine to MME is 0.15. This means that 1 mg of Codeine is equivalent to 0.15 mg of Morphine. - The patient takes 10 mg of Codeine 2 times a day. - Therefore, the total daily dose of Codeine is \( 10 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 20 \, \text{mg/day} \). - The MME for Codeine is: \( 20 \, \text{mg} \times 0.15 = 3 \, \text{MME} \).

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{GFR (mL/min/1.73 m}^2\text{)} = 175 \times (\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} \times (0.742)^{\text{if female}} \times (1.212)^{\text{if African American}} \times (0.993)^{\text{Age}} \] From the patient note, we have the following information: - The patient is a 73-year-old African American woman. - The patient's serum creatinine level is mentioned as elevated, and one specific value is given: on the day when renal function was most impaired, the creatinine was 8 mg/dL. Let's use the creatinine value of 8 mg/dL to calculate the GFR using the MDRD equation. The MDRD equation for this patient would be: \[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times (\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} \times (0.742) \times (1.212) \times (0.993)^{73} \] Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Plug in the serum creatinine value (8 mg/dL). \[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times (8)^{-1.154} \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \times (0.993)^{73} \] Step 2: Calculate \( (8)^{-1.154} \). Using a calculator: \[ (8)^{-1.154} \approx 0.113 \] Step 3: Calculate \( (0.993)^{73} \). Using a calculator: \[ (0.993)^{73} \approx 0.531 \] Now we can plug these values back into the equation: \[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times 0.113 \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \times 0.531 \] Step 4: Multiply these values step-by-step. First, multiply \( 175 \times 0.113 \): \[ 175 \times 0.113 = 19.775 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.742: \[ 19.775 \times 0.742 = 14.663 \] Then, multiply the result by 1.212: \[ 14.663 \times 1.212 = 17.768 \] Finally, multiply the result by 0.531: \[ 17.768 \times 0.531 = 9.451 \] So the GFR is approximately 9.451 mL/min/1.73 m². Rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, the GFR is approximately 9.5 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the patient's GFR is approximately 9.5 mL/min/1.73 m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?

The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium (mEq/L) = Measured Sodium (mEq/L) + (Glucose (mg/dL) - 100) / 18 From the patient note, the measured sodium level is 136 mEq/L. The random blood sugar level is 250 mg/dL. Let's use the formula to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. Corrected Sodium = 136 + (250 - 100) / 18 Now, let's do the math step by step: 1. Calculate the difference between the glucose level and 100 mg/dL: 250 - 100 = 150 mg/dL 2. Divide this difference by 18: 150 / 18 ≈ 8.33 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's delta ratio?

Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Typically, the delta ratio is used in the context of liver function tests and is often related to the ratio of the increase in bilirubin to the increase in aminotransferases (ALT and AST). However, the term "delta ratio" can also refer to the ratio of the increase in bilirubin to the increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), especially in the context of cholestasis. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the relevant laboratory values for the calculation. We need to find the initial and peak values of bilirubin, ALP, and other relevant enzymes. From the patient note: - On admission, the baseline laboratory values just 10 days prior to the admission were: - Bilirubin total: 0.3 mg/dL - Bilirubin direct: 0.1 mg/dL - On day 15, the patient was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation, and the liver function tests showed: - Bilirubin total (T): 9.6 mg/dL - Direct (D): 7.3 mg/dL - ALP: 388 IU/L - On day 36, when the patient was admitted to the liver transplant center: - AST: 152 IU/L - ALT: 85 IU/L - ALP: >1800 IU/L - GGT: >1500 IU/L - Total bilirubin: 11.5 mg/dL - On day 54, the patient was readmitted to the ER with the following lab values: - Bilirubin (T): 28.7 mg/dL - Direct (D): 21.3 mg/dL - ALP: >1884 IU/L - ALT: 24 IU/L To calculate the delta ratio, we will use the increase in total bilirubin and the increase in ALP. Let's use the values from the time the patient was first noted to have jaundice (day 15) and the peak values. On day 15: - Bilirubin total: 9.6 mg/dL - ALP: 388 IU/L On day 54 (when the patient was readmitted to the ER): - Bilirubin total: 28.7 mg/dL - ALP: >1884 IU/L Let's calculate the increase in bilirubin and ALP from the baseline (10 days before admission) to the peak values. Baseline values (10 days before admission): - Bilirubin total: 0.3 mg/dL - ALP: Not provided directly, but we can use the value from day 15 as a reference point for the increase. Increase in bilirubin from baseline to day 54: \[ \Delta \text{Bilirubin} = 28.7 \, \text{mg/dL} - 0.3 \, \text{mg/dL} = 28.4 \, \text{mg/dL} \] Increase in ALP from day 15 to day 54: Since the ALP on day 15 was 388 IU/L and on day 54 it was >1884 IU/L, the increase in ALP is: \[ \Delta \text{ALP} = 1884 \, \text{IU/L} - 388 \, \text{IU/L} = 1496 \, \text{IU/L} \] Now, the delta ratio is defined as the ratio of the increase in bilirubin to the increase in ALP. \[ \text{Delta Ratio} = \frac{\Delta \text{Bilirubin}}{\Delta \text{ALP}} = \frac{28.4 \, \text{mg/dL}}{1496 \, \text{IU/L}} \approx 0.019 \] However, another approach is to use the increase from the baseline to the peak values for both bilirubin and ALP. Let's use the baseline ALP value if we assume it was within the normal range. The normal range for ALP is typically around 40-129 IU/L. Let's use the lower limit of the normal range for simplicity. Baseline ALP: 40 IU/L (assuming the normal range) Increase in ALP from baseline to day 54: \[ \Delta \text{ALP} = 1884 \, \text{IU/L} - 40 \, \text{IU/L} = 1844 \, \text{IU/L} \] Now the delta ratio is: \[ \text{Delta Ratio} = \frac{\Delta \text{Bilirubin}}{\Delta \text{ALP}} = \frac{28.4 \, \text{mg/dL}}{1844 \, \text{IU/L}} \approx 0.015 \] Given the context of the patient's condition and the progression of cholestasis, the delta ratio is typically used to assess the severity and type of liver injury. In this case, the delta ratio is quite small, indicating a cholestatic pattern. Thus, the delta ratio is approximately 0.015 to 0.019. Since the question does not specify which baseline to use, I will use the simpler approach using the increase from the day 15 values to the peak values on day 54. So the delta ratio is approximately 0.019. Therefore, the final answer is approximately 0.019. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta ratio, we need the increase in bilirubin and the increase in ALP. We use the baseline values from 10 days before admission and the peak values on day 54. The increase in bilirubin from baseline (0.3 mg/dL) to day 54 (28.7 mg/dL) is 28.4 mg/dL. The increase in ALP from day 15 (388 IU/L) to day 54 (>1884 IU/L) is approximately 1496 IU/L. Therefore, the delta ratio is \(\frac{28.4 \, \text{mg/dL}}{1496 \, \text{IU/L}} \approx 0.019\).", "answer": "0.019"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

The formula for the anion gap (AG) is: \[ \text{AG} = \text{Na}^+ - (\text{Cl}^- + \text{HCO}_3^-) \] From the given information, the patient's laboratory values are: - Sodium (Na): 148 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl): 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3): 6 mmol/L Using these values, we can calculate the anion gap: \[ \text{AG} = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 \, \text{mmol/L} \] However, the problem states that the anion gap (AG) is 22 mmol/L. This seems to be a discrepancy. Let's assume the given anion gap is correct, which is 22 mmol/L. The albumin-corrected anion gap is used to adjust the anion gap for the level of albumin. The formula to correct the anion gap for albumin is: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = \text{Measured AG} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] The normal range for albumin is typically around 4.0 g/dL. The patient's albumin level is 4.2 g/dL. Using the formula: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 22 + 2.5 \times (4.0 - 4.2) \] Let's calculate the term inside the parentheses first: \[ 4.0 - 4.2 = -0.2 \] Now plug this into the formula: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 22 + 2.5 \times (-0.2) = 22 + 2.5 \times (-0.2) = 22 - 0.5 = 21.5 \, \text{mmol/L} \] The term "albumin-corrected delta gap" is not a standard term. It seems like there might be some confusion. The delta gap is typically used in the context of calculating the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap to help identify the cause of the metabolic acidosis. The normal anion gap is usually between 8-12 mmol/L. Let's assume the normal anion gap is 12 mmol/L for this calculation. The delta gap is calculated as: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = \text{Measured AG} - \text{Normal AG} \] Using the measured AG of 22 mmol/L and the normal AG of 12 mmol/L: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = 22 - 12 = 10 \, \text{mmol/L} \] Now, if we use the corrected AG that we just calculated (21.5 mmol/L), the albumin-corrected delta gap would be: \[ \text{Albumin-Corrected Delta Gap} = \text{Corrected AG} - \text{Normal AG} = 21.5 - 12 = 9.5 \, \text{mmol/L} \] Thus, the albumin-corrected delta gap is 9.5 mEq/L. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the measured anion gap using the given values for Na, Cl, and HCO3. However, the problem states the anion gap is 22 mmol/L, so we use this value. 2. Correct the anion gap for the patient's albumin level. 3. Calculate the delta gap using both the measured anion gap and the corrected anion gap. The final answer is the albumin-corrected delta gap, which is 9.5 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To approach this task, we need to calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap (also known as the delta gap) for the patient.

This negative value indicates that the patient's body is not effectively neutralizing the acids, consistent with metabolic acidosis. The final answer is -1.57 mEq/L.", 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '9.5', 'Target Explanation': 'No Explanation', 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L.

The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}} \] However, the RR interval is typically derived from the heart rate. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm), converted to seconds. The heart rate is given as 164 bpm. To find the RR interval in seconds, we use the formula: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}}. \] Given the heart rate is 164 bpm: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{164} \approx 0.366 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now, we'll use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The given QT interval is 330 msec. The Fridericia formula is: \[ \text{QTcF} = \text{QT} \div \left(\text{RR}\right)^{1/3}. \] Substitute the values we have: \[ \text{RR interval} = 0.366 \, \text{seconds}, \] and the QT interval is 330 msec. Now, we need to calculate \(\left(\text{RR}\right)^{1/3}\): \[ \left(0.366\right)^{1/3}. \] Using a calculator to find the cube root of 0.366: \[ \left(0.366\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.715. \] Now, we can plug this into the Fridericia formula: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{330}{0.715} \approx 461.54 \, \text{msec}. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 462 msec. So, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the RR interval from the given heart rate. - Heart rate = 164 bpm. - RR interval = $\frac{60}{164} \approx 0.366$ seconds. 2. Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. - The Fridericia formula is $\text{QTcF} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\left(\text{RR}\right)^{1/3}}$. - Given QT = 330 msec and RR = 0.366 seconds. - Calculate $\left(\text{RR}\right)^{1/3} = \left(0.366\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.715$. - Plug in the values into the formula: $\text{QTcF} = \frac{330}{0.715} \approx 461.54$ msec. - Round to the nearest whole number to get approximately 462 msec. Thus, the patient's corrected QT interval is approximately 462 msec. The final answer is 462 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To approach this task, we'll use the Fridericia formula for correcting the QT interval.

So, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the RR interval from the given heart rate. - Heart rate = 164 bpm. - RR interval = $\\frac{60}{164} \\approx 0.366$ seconds. 2. Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. - The Fridericia formula is $\\text{QTcF} = \\frac{\\text{QT}}{\\left(\\text{RR}\\right)^{1/3}}$. - Given QT = 330 msec and RR = 0.366 seconds. - Calculate $\\left(\\text{RR}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(0.366\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 0.715$. - Plug in the values into the formula: $\\text{QTcF} = \\frac{330}{0.715} \\approx 461.54$ msec. - Round to the nearest whole number to get approximately 462 msec. Thus, the patient's corrected QT interval is approximately 462 msec.", "answer": "462"}

The information provided includes the patient's serum sodium level (Na+) of 134 mEq/L. To correct the sodium concentration, we need to consider factors that can affect the sodium level, such as the patient's blood glucose level and the presence of any conditions that might cause a shift in sodium. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 18 The patient's glucose level is 70 mg/dL. Since the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL, there is no hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia to correct for. Therefore, the formula would not apply here because the glucose level is not above the threshold of 100 mg/dL. Since the glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is below the threshold of 100 mg/dL, the measured sodium concentration does not need any correction for hyperglycemia. Thus, the corrected sodium concentration is the same as the measured sodium concentration, which is 134 mEq/L. Therefore, the patient's corrected sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we use the formula for correcting sodium due to hyperglycemia: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 18. The measured sodium is 134 mEq/L, and the glucose level is 70 mg/dL. Since the glucose level (70 mg/dL) is below 100 mg/dL, the term (Glucose - 100) will be negative or zero, and thus the correction term (Glucose - 100) / 18 will be zero or negative, indicating no need for correction due to hyperglycemia. Specifically, (70 - 100) = -30, and (-30) / 18 = -1.67. Adding this to the measured sodium would actually decrease the sodium level, which doesn't make sense in this context since the glucose level is already below the threshold that would require correction. Therefore, the measured sodium concentration of 134 mEq/L is the corrected sodium concentration.", "answer": "134"}

A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal).

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied. Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ). CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ). The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid. Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL. Here is the task: What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap, we need the following values from the patient's serum chemistries: sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and albumin. The formula for the anion gap is: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Sodium} - (\text{Chloride} + \text{Bicarbonate}) \] The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] where the normal albumin level is typically considered to be 4 g/dL. From the given data: - Sodium = 139 mEq/L - Chloride = 102 mEq/L - Bicarbonate = 30 mEq/L - Albumin = 1.5 g/dL Let's calculate the anion gap first: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Sodium} - (\text{Chloride} + \text{Bicarbonate}) = 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, we will calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap using the formula: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] Plugging in the values: - Normal Albumin = 4 g/dL - Patient's Albumin = 1.5 g/dL So, \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.5) \] Calculate the difference between the normal albumin and the patient's albumin: \[ 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 \] Now multiply this difference by 2.5: \[ 2.5 \times 2.5 = 6.25 \] Add this result to the anion gap: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Therefore, the patient's albumin-corrected anion gap is 13.25 mEq/L. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the anion gap using the formula: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Sodium} - (\text{Chloride} + \text{Bicarbonate}) \] - Sodium = 139 mEq/L - Chloride = 102 mEq/L - Bicarbonate = 30 mEq/L - Anion Gap = 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 mEq/L 2. Use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] - Normal Albumin = 4 g/dL - Patient's Albumin = 1.5 g/dL - Difference in Albumin = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 g/dL - Correction term = 2.5 \times 2.5 = 6.25 - Albumin-corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25 mEq/L Thus, the final answer is 13.25 mEq/L.

The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 02/03/2012. 2. The cycle length is 28 days, which is the standard cycle length used in Naegele's Rule. Naegele's Rule states that the estimated due date is calculated by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of the last menstrual period. A simplified method involves adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then adding 9 months to that date. Let's apply this step-by-step: Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP. The LMP is February 3, 2012. Adding 7 days to February 3, 2012 gives us February 10, 2012. Step 2: Add 9 months to February 10, 2012. Adding 9 months to February 10, 2012 means we move forward 9 months from February. If we add 9 months to February, we get: February + 9 months = November of the same year. So, November 10, 2012. Therefore, the estimated due date is November 10, 2012. Thus, the estimated due date is 11/10/2012.

To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

The PSI is based on several factors including age, vital signs, comorbidities, and laboratory results. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the key information from the patient note. - Age: 75 years old. - Residence: Nursing home. - Medical history: Congestive heart failure (CHF), no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. - Vital signs: - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal). - Pulse rate: 82 bpm (normal). - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min (slightly elevated but within the range of mild tachypnea). - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal). - Laboratory results: - Hematocrit: 39% (normal range for females is typically around 37-47%, so this is within the normal range). - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated, indicating hyperglycemia). - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL (slightly high, but not extremely elevated; normal range is usually 7-20 mg/dL). - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (normal). - Arterial blood gas: pH 7.40 (normal), PaO2 80 mm Hg (normal or slightly low depending on the context, but within the range for mild hypoxemia if the patient has underlying conditions). - Chest X-ray: Indicates pleural effusion. Step 2: Apply the PSI scoring system. The PSI uses a combination of age, comorbidities, and certain laboratory values to categorize patients into risk classes. The PSI has five classes, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class V being the highest risk. The PSI score is based on the following factors: 1. Age 2. Comorbid conditions 3. Vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure) 4. Laboratory values (BUN, PaO2, hematocrit, blood glucose) Let's evaluate each component: **Age:** The patient is 75 years old. Age is a significant factor in PSI. **Comorbid Conditions:** The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is a comorbid condition. **Vital Signs:** - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal). - Pulse: 82 bpm (normal). - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min (slightly elevated but not critically high). - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal). **Laboratory Values:** - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated). - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal or slightly low). - Hematocrit: 39% (normal). - Blood glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated). Now let's apply the PSI criteria step-by-step. **Step 1: Age** The patient is 75 years old, which puts her in the age category of > 65 years. **Step 2: Comorbid Conditions** The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is a comorbid condition included in the PSI scoring. **Step 3: Vital Signs and Laboratory Values:** We need to check if any of the following criteria are met: - Temperature < 36°C or ≥ 39°C - Heart rate > 125 bpm - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min - Systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or Diastolic BP < 60 mm Hg From the given data: - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal). - Heart rate: 82 bpm (normal). - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min (normal). - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal). None of these vital sign criteria are met. Next, we look at the laboratory values: - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated but not extremely high). - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal or slightly low). - Hematocrit: 39% (normal). - Blood glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated). For the PSI, we need to check if any of the following laboratory criteria are met: - BUN ≥ 30 mg/dL - PaO2 < 60 mm Hg - Hematocrit < 30% - Blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL From the given data: - BUN: 27 mg/dL (not meeting the criterion of ≥ 30 mg/dL). - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (not meeting the criterion of < 60 mm Hg). - Hematocrit: 39% (not meeting the criterion of < 30%). - Blood glucose: 180 mg/dL (not meeting the criterion of ≥ 250 mg/dL). None of the laboratory criteria are met. **Step 4: Summarize the PSI Score:** Since the patient is 75 years old (over 65), has a comorbid condition (CHF), and none of the vital sign or laboratory abnormalities that significantly increase the PSI score are present, we need to use the PSI calculator or the PSI scoring system to determine the class. The PSI score involves assigning points based on age, comorbidities, and the presence of certain abnormalities. Let's use the PSI scoring system: 1. **Age:** - Over 65 years: +1 point. 2. **Comorbid Conditions:** - Congestive heart failure (CHF): +1 point. 3. **Vital Signs and Laboratory Values:** - None of the abnormal vital signs or laboratory values that add points are present. So, the total points from the given information are: - Age > 65: +1 point. - Comorbid condition (CHF): +1 point. Total points = 2 points. Now, we need to map these points to the PSI class. The PSI class is determined by the total points and the presence of specific risk factors. Since the patient has: - Age > 65 - Comorbid condition (CHF) - No severe abnormalities in vital signs or lab values Let's use the PSI classification rules: The PSI classification involves a more detailed scoring system that includes points for various factors. Here's a simplified approach using the PSI scoring system: 1. **Age:** - 75 years old: This puts the patient in the age category of > 65. 2. **Comorbidities:** - CHF is present. 3. **Vital Signs:** - Normal temperature. - Normal pulse. - Slightly elevated respiratory rate (but not critically high). - Normal blood pressure. 4. **Laboratory Values:** - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated but not meeting the PSI criterion of ≥ 30 mg/dL). - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal). - Hematocrit: 39% (normal). - Blood glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated but not meeting the PSI criterion of ≥ 250 mg/dL). Given the information, the patient has: - Age > 65: +1 point. - CHF: +1 point. Since there are no severe abnormalities in vital signs or lab values that would add additional points, the total score is relatively low. Based on the PSI scoring system, the patient likely falls into a moderate risk category. To determine the exact PSI class, we can use the PSI calculator or the PSI scoring table. Let's use the PSI scoring table to categorize the patient: The PSI score is calculated using a point system and then mapped to one of the five classes (I to V). For a 75-year-old patient with CHF and the given vital signs and lab values: - Age > 65: +1 point. - CHF: +1 point. Since the patient has no severe abnormalities in vital signs or lab values, the total score is likely to be in the range that corresponds to PSI Class III or IV. However, since the patient has a pleural effusion on chest X-ray, this indicates a more severe form of pneumonia, which might push the score higher. Given the information: - Age > 65: +1 point. - CHF: +1 point. - Pleural effusion (indicates a more severe form of pneumonia). Considering the presence of pleural effusion and the comorbidity of CHF, the patient likely falls into PSI Class III or IV. To simplify and conclude: The patient's PSI class is likely **Class III** or **Class IV**. Since the patient has a comorbid condition (CHF) and is over 65, and considering the presence of pleural effusion, the most appropriate PSI class is likely **Class III**. Thus, the final answer is that the patient's PSI is likely in **Class III**. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to use the criteria and scoring system for PSI. The key information from the patient note includes age (75 years), residence in a nursing home, medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions, vital signs (temperature 36.5°C, pulse 82 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg), laboratory results (hematocrit 39%, glucose 180 mg/dL, BUN 27 mg/dL, sodium 139 mEq/L), arterial blood gas (pH 7.40, PaO2 80 mm Hg), and chest X-ray showing pleural effusion. The PSI is based on age, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values. The patient is over 65 years old and has CHF as a comorbid condition. None of the severe abnormalities in vital signs or lab values that significantly increase the PSI score are present. Considering the presence of pleural effusion and the comorbidity of CHF, the patient likely falls into PSI Class III or IV.

The key information from the patient note includes age (75 years), residence in a nursing home, medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions, vital signs (temperature 36.5°C, pulse 82 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg), laboratory results (hematocrit 39%, glucose 180 mg/dL, BUN 27 mg/dL, sodium 139 mEq/L), arterial blood gas (pH 7.40, PaO2 80 mm Hg), and chest X-ray showing pleural effusion. The PSI is based on age, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values. The patient is over 65 years old and has CHF as a comorbid condition. None of the severe abnormalities in vital signs or lab values that significantly increase the PSI score are present. Considering the presence of pleural effusion and the comorbidity of CHF, the patient likely falls into PSI Class III or IV. Given the information, the most appropriate PSI class is likely Class III.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 75.0 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75.0 = 75.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75.0 - 10 = 65.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 10 = 85.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85.0 + 10 = 95.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 82.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 95.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

The Glasgow-Blatchford Score is used to assess the severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Here are the given details from the patient note: - Age: 69 years old - Complaint: Dark, tarry stools (melena) over the last two days - Heart rate: 88 beats per minute - Systolic blood pressure: 130 mm Hg - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18 mg/dL - Hemoglobin concentration: 13 g/dL - The patient is taking sodium bicarbonate for a diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Now, let's calculate the score step-by-step using the Glasgow-Blatchford Score criteria: 1. Age ≥ 60 years: +1 point Since the patient is 69 years old, this criterion applies. Score = +1. 2. Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg: +2 points The patient's systolic blood pressure is 130 mm Hg, which is not below 90 mm Hg. Score = 0 for this criterion. 3. Heart rate > 100 beats per minute: +1 point The patient's heart rate is 88 beats per minute, which is not above 100 beats per minute. Score = 0 for this criterion. 4. BUN > 10 mmol/L (equivalent to approximately 28 mg/dL): +1 point The patient's BUN level is 18 mg/dL. Since 18 mg/dL is less than 28 mg/dL, this criterion does not apply. Score = 0 for this criterion. 5. Hemoglobin < 9 g/dL: +2 points The patient's hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, which is not below 9 g/dL. Score = 0 for this criterion. 6. Hemoglobin 9-11 g/dL: +1 point The patient's hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, which does not fall within the range of 9-11 g/dL. Score = 0 for this criterion. 7. Variceal bleeding: +2 points There is no mention of variceal bleeding in the patient note. Therefore, this criterion does not apply. Score = 0 for this criterion. 8. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): +1 point The patient has a diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer and is taking sodium bicarbonate, indicating PUD. Score = +1 for this criterion. 9. Melena: +1 point The patient is complaining of dark, tarry stools (melena). Score = +1 for this criterion. Now, let's sum up the points from the applicable criteria: - Age ≥ 60 years: +1 point - Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): +1 point - Melena: +1 point Total score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

The formula is: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio} = \frac{\Delta \text{Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} \] where $\Delta \text{Creatinine}$ is the change in creatinine from the baseline to the peak creatinine level, and Albumin is the serum albumin level. From the patient note, we have the following information: - The patient's creatinine level at the previous visit 3 years prior was 1.15 mg/dL. - The current creatinine level is 10.48 mg/dL. - The albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. To calculate $\Delta \text{Creatinine}$: \[ \Delta \text{Creatinine} = \text{Peak Creatinine} - \text{Baseline Creatinine} = 10.48 \, \text{mg/dL} - 1.15 \, \text{mg/dL} = 9.33 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] Now, we can plug in the values into the formula for the albumin-corrected delta ratio: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio} = \frac{\Delta \text{Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} = \frac{9.33 \, \text{mg/dL}}{3.8 \, \text{g/dL}}. \] Perform the division: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio} = \frac{9.33}{3.8} \approx 2.455. \] Rounded to two decimal places, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is approximately 2.46. So, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the baseline creatinine level: 1.15 mg/dL. 2. Identify the peak creatinine level: 10.48 mg/dL. 3. Calculate the change in creatinine ($\Delta \text{Creatinine}$): $10.48 - 1.15 = 9.33$ mg/dL. 4. Identify the albumin level: 3.8 g/dL. 5. Use the formula for the albumin-corrected delta ratio: $\frac{\Delta \text{Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} = \frac{9.33}{3.8} \approx 2.455$. Thus, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is approximately 2.46. The final answer is 2.46. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta ratio, we use the formula: \[ \\text{Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Creatinine}}{\\text{Albumin}}. \\] Here, the baseline creatinine is 1.15 mg/dL and the peak creatinine is 10.48 mg/dL. Therefore, the change in creatinine ($\\Delta \\text{Creatinine}$) is $10.48 - 1.15 = 9.33$ mg/dL. The albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: \[ \\text{Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio} = \\frac{9.33}{3.8} \\approx 2.455. \\] Rounding this to two decimal places, we get approximately 2.46.", "answer": "2.46"}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.
The patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.

Here is the task: What is the patient's FeverPAIN score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the FeverPAIN score for this patient, we need to evaluate the given criteria for the FeverPAIN score. The FeverPAIN score is used to assess the severity of a patient's condition and is based on the following components: - Fever - Pain - Airway compromise - Inflammation - Neutrophilia Let's break this down step-by-step: 1. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 39.6°C, which indicates a high fever. This criterion is met. 2. **Pain**: The patient presents with symptoms such as drooling, inability to eat solids, and hoarseness. These symptoms suggest discomfort and pain, likely related to the throat and neck area. Therefore, this criterion is met. 3. **Airway Compromise**: The patient has symptoms like loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness. These symptoms indicate some degree of airway compromise. Therefore, this criterion is met. 4. **Inflammation**: The patient has multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes (up to 3.6 cm), elevated white blood cell count (14.2 × 10^3/µL), and an elevated C-reactive protein level (17.17 mg/dL). All these findings suggest significant inflammation. Therefore, this criterion is met. 5. **Neutrophilia**: The white blood cell differential shows that the patient has 37% neutrophils. Neutrophilia is typically defined as an elevated percentage or absolute number of neutrophils. Here, the percentage of neutrophils is 37%, which is not particularly high (normal range for neutrophils is typically around 40-75%). However, the total white blood cell count is elevated (14.2 × 10^3/µL), suggesting an overall increase in leukocytes. To determine if there is neutrophilia, we need to calculate the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). The formula for ANC is: \[ \text{ANC} = \text{(Percentage of Neutrophils / 100)} \times \text{WBC count} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{ANC} = \left(\frac{37}{100}\right) \times 14.2 \times 10^3/\mu L = 0.37 \times 14.2 \times 10^3/\mu L = 5.254 \times 10^3/\mu L \] The normal range for ANC is typically between 1.5 × 10^3/µL to 7.5 × 10^3/µL. An ANC of 5.254 × 10^3/µL falls within the normal to slightly elevated range but is not extremely high. However, since the total WBC count is elevated and there is significant inflammation, we might consider this criterion as met due to the overall inflammatory response and elevated WBC count. Given the context and the presence of significant inflammation and elevated WBC count, we can consider this criterion as met. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Fever: Yes - Pain: Yes - Airway Compromise: Yes - Inflammation: Yes - Neutrophilia: Yes (considering the elevated WBC count and overall inflammatory response) Since all 5 criteria (Fever, Pain, Airway Compromise, Inflammation, and Neutrophilia) are met, the FeverPAIN score is 5. Therefore, the patient's FeverPAIN score is 5. The JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we evaluate the following components: \n1.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to assess the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The components are: - C: Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction - H: Hypertension - A2: Age ≥75 years (scored as 2 points) - D: Diabetes mellitus - S2: Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (scored as 2 points) - V: Vascular disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, aortic plaque) - A: Age 65-74 years (scored as 1 point) - S: Sex category (female) Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (C):** The patient note does not mention congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Therefore, this component scores 0. 2. **Hypertension (H):** The patient has a history of arterial hypertension. Therefore, this component scores 1. 3. **Age ≥75 years (A2):** The patient is 83 years old, which is greater than or equal to 75 years. Therefore, this component scores 2. 4. **Diabetes mellitus (D):** The patient has a history of diabetes. Therefore, this component scores 1. 5. **Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (S2):** The patient presented with acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia, which suggests a stroke event. However, for the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we are considering the patient's history prior to this current event. The note does not mention any previous stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism. Therefore, this component scores 0. 6. **Vascular disease (V):** The patient note does not mention any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque. Therefore, this component scores 0. 7. **Age 65-74 years (A):** Since the patient is 83 years old, this component does not apply because he falls into the "Age ≥75 years" category already. Therefore, this component scores 0. 8. **Sex category (S):** The patient is male. Therefore, this component scores 0. Now, let's add up the scores from the applicable components: - C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction): 0 - H (Hypertension): 1 - A2 (Age ≥75 years): 2 - D (Diabetes mellitus): 1 - S2 (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism): 0 - V (Vascular disease): 0 - A (Age 65-74 years): 0 - S (Sex category): 0 Adding these up: 0 (C) + 1 (H) + 2 (A2) + 1 (D) + 0 (S2) + 0 (V) + 0 (A) + 0 (S) = 4. Therefore, the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the patient is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we evaluate each component based on the patient's characteristics:\n\n- C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction): No mention of congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day.

Let's use the data from the time of the liver biopsy and the subsequent follow-up for the most relevant values. From the note: - Before the liver biopsy, the patient's laboratory findings included: - AST: 547 IU/L - ALT: 600 IU/L - Platelet count: 101000 /mcL (or 101,000 /μL). Let's plug these values into the FIB-4 formula. The formula is: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \left(\frac{\text{Age} \times \text{AST}}{\text{Platelet Count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}}}\right) \] Plugging in the values: - Age = 2 years - AST = 547 IU/L - ALT = 600 IU/L - Platelet Count = 101000 /μL Now, let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = \sqrt{600} \approx 24.49 \] 2. Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \left(\frac{2 \times 547}{101000 \times 24.49}\right) \] 3. Calculate the numerator: \[ 2 \times 547 = 1094 \] 4. Calculate the denominator: \[ 101000 \times 24.49 \approx 2473490 \] 5. Now, divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{1094}{2473490} \approx 0.000442 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000442. Thus, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the required parameters: Age, AST, ALT, and Platelet Count. 2. Use the values from before the liver biopsy: - Age = 2 years - AST = 547 IU/L - ALT = 600 IU/L - Platelet Count = 101000 /μL 3. Calculate the square root of ALT: $\sqrt{600} \approx 24.49$. 4. Plug the values into the FIB-4 formula: $\text{FIB-4} = \left(\frac{2 \times 547}{101000 \times 24.49}\right)$. 5. Calculate the numerator: $2 \times 547 = 1094$. 6. Calculate the denominator: $101000 \times 24.49 \approx 2473490$. 7. Divide the numerator by the denominator: $\frac{1094}{2473490} \approx 0.000442$. Therefore, the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000442. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, we use the formula: \[ \\text{FIB-4} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Age} \\times \\text{AST}}{\\text{Platelet Count} \\times \\sqrt{\\text{ALT}}}\\right).

A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions. The components of the HAS-BLED score are: - H (Hypertension): 1 point if the patient has hypertension (defined as systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg or on treatment for hypertension). - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function): 1 point for abnormal renal function (creatinine > 1.3 mg/dL or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis). - S (Stroke): 1 point if the patient has a history of stroke. - B (Bleeding): 1 point if the patient has a history of bleeding. - L (Labile INR): 1 point if the patient has labile INR (if on anticoagulation therapy, but the patient is not on anticoagulants here, so this criterion is not applicable). - E (Elderly): 1 point if the patient is aged ≥ 75 years. - D (Drugs/alcohol): 1 point if the patient is on NSAIDs or has alcohol abuse. Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has a documented history of hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. This criterion is met. Score = 1 point. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function):** The patient has a history of a kidney transplant and suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis. This indicates both abnormal renal function and liver disease. Therefore, this criterion is met. Score = 1 point. 3. **S (Stroke):** The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) of the brain last year. A TIA is considered a risk factor similar to a stroke. Therefore, this criterion is met. Score = 1 point. 4. **B (Bleeding):** The patient denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0 points. 5. **L (Labile INR):** The patient is not on anticoagulation therapy, so this criterion is not applicable. Score = 0 points. 6. **E (Elderly):** The patient is 22 years old. Since she is not aged ≥ 75 years, this criterion is not met. Score = 0 points. 7. **D (Drugs/alcohol):** The patient admits to drinking more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. This indicates alcohol abuse. Therefore, this criterion is met. Score = 1 point. Now, let's sum up the points from the criteria that were met: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function): 1 point - S (Stroke): 1 point - B (Bleeding): 0 points - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Elderly): 0 points - D (Drugs/alcohol): 1 point Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4 points.

The Bazett formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where QT is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec), and RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (the heart rate interval), which can be derived from the heart rate. The heart rate is given as 136 bpm (beats per minute). We need to convert this heart rate into the RR interval in seconds. The formula to convert heart rate to the RR interval is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}}. \] Given the heart rate is 136 bpm: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{136} \approx 0.4412 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we can use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. The measured QT interval is 330 msec. So the formula becomes: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.4412}}. \] Let's calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{0.4412} \approx 0.6642. \] Now we can plug this value back into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.56. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 497 msec. So the patient's corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is approximately 497 msec. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Convert the heart rate (136 bpm) to the RR interval in seconds. \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{136} \approx 0.4412 \, \text{seconds}. \] 2. Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.4412}}. \] 3. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{0.4412} \approx 0.6642. \] 4. Plug the square root value into the formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.56. \] 5. Round the result to the nearest whole number to get the final corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} \approx 497 \, \text{msec}. \] Thus, the corrected QT interval is 497 msec. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Here is the task:
Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?

The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{GFR (mL/min/1.73 m}^2\text{)} = 175 \times (\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} \times \text{Age}^{-0.203} \times [0.742 \text{ if female}] \times [1.210 \text{ if African American}] \] From the patient note, we have the following information: - Serum creatinine: 14.6 mg/dL - Age: 27 years - Sex: Female - Race: African-American Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step. Step 1: Identify the values for the variables in the MDRD equation. - Serum Creatinine = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - Sex = Female (so we use the factor 0.742) - Race = African-American (so we use the factor 1.210) Step 2: Plug these values into the MDRD equation. The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times (\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} \times \text{Age}^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Now, let's calculate each part step by step. Step 3: Calculate \((\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154}\). \[ (\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} = (14.6)^{-1.154} \] Using a calculator: \[ (14.6)^{-1.154} \approx 0.0407 \] Step 4: Calculate \(\text{Age}^{-0.203}\). \[ \text{Age}^{-0.203} = (27)^{-0.203} \] Using a calculator: \[ (27)^{-0.203} \approx 0.602 \] Step 5: Now, multiply all the components together. \[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times 0.0407 \times 0.602 \times 0.742 \times 1.210 \] Let's do this step by step. First, multiply \(175 \times 0.0407\): \[ 175 \times 0.0407 \approx 7.1225 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.602: \[ 7.1225 \times 0.602 \approx 4.288 \] Then, multiply the result by 0.742: \[ 4.288 \times 0.742 \approx 3.181 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.210: \[ 3.181 \times 1.210 \approx 3.850 \] So, the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is approximately 3.85 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the patient's GFR is approximately 3.85 mL/min/1.73 m². The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the MDRD equation, we use the formula: \[ \\text{GFR (mL/min/1.73 m}^2\\text{)} = 175 \\times (\\text{Serum Creatinine})^{-1.154} \\times \\text{Age}^{-0.203} \\times [0.742 \\text{ if female}] \\times [1.210 \\text{ if African American}] \\] Given the information: - Serum Creatinine = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - Sex = Female (factor = 0.742) - Race = African-American (factor = 1.210).

Rearrange the BMI formula to solve for weight: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2 \] Plug in the given values: the target BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2 and the height is 1.45 m. \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = 18.5 \times (1.45)^2 \] Step 5: Calculate \( (1.45)^2 \): \[ (1.45)^2 = 2.1025 \] Step 6: Now multiply this result by the target BMI (18.5): \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = 18.5 \times 2.1025 \] Step 7: Perform the multiplication: \[ 18.5 \times 2.1025 = 38.94625 \] So the patient's target weight is approximately 38.94625 kg. Rounding to a reasonable precision (typically to one decimal place for weight), we get about 38.9 kg. Therefore, the patient's target weight is approximately 38.9 kg. The final answer is 38.9 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the BMI formula: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))^2.

First, calculate the square of the height: (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. Then multiply this by the target BMI: Weight (kg) = 18.5 * 2.1025 = 38.94625 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To approach this task, we'll use the Hodges formula for calculating the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Hodges formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left( \frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1 \right) \] where: - \(\text{QT}\) is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - \(\text{HR}\) is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). From the patient note, we have: - The QT interval (\(\text{QT}\)) = 330 msec. - The heart rate (\(\text{HR}\)) = 154 bpm. Now, let's plug these values into the Hodges formula step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}}\). \[ \frac{60}{154} \approx 0.3896 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\). \[ \frac{60}{154} - 1 \approx 0.3896 - 1 = -0.6104 \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right)\). \[ 0.154 \times (-0.6104) \approx -0.094 \] Step 4: Now, use the Hodges formula to find the corrected QT interval (\(\text{QTc}_\text{Hodges}\)): \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right) \] Plugging in the values we calculated: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + (-0.094) = 330 - 0.094 \approx 329.906 \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. We have the given values: QT = 330 msec and HR = 154 bpm. 2. We use the Hodges formula: \(\text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right)\). 3. Calculate \(\frac{60}{154}\), which is approximately 0.3896. 4. Calculate \(\frac{60}{154} - 1\), which is approximately 0.3896 - 1 = -0.6104. 5. Calculate \(0.154 \times (-0.6104)\), which is approximately -0.094. 6. Add this result to the original QT interval: \(330 + (-0.094) = 329.906\), which rounds to approximately 330 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. The final answer is 330 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To approach this task, we'll use the Hodges formula for calculating the corrected QT interval (QTc).

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

Step 1: Identify the relevant laboratory values for calculating the anion gap. The anion gap is calculated using the formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) We have the following values from the patient's laboratory results upon admission to the Children's Hospital: - Sodium: 134 mEq/L - Chloride: 104 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 22 mEq/L Step 2: Calculate the anion gap using these values. Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate) Anion Gap = 134 - (104 + 22) Anion Gap = 134 - 126 Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L Step 3: To calculate the delta gap, we also need the serum sodium and the serum bicarbonate and chloride levels to calculate the anion gap, and we need the serum creatinine level to calculate the delta ratio. The formula for the delta ratio is: Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - (Serum Creatinine - 2) However, the term "delta gap" is not a standard medical term. It seems like there might be some confusion. Typically, we use the term "delta ratio" which is the difference between the anion gap and the serum creatinine level minus 2. But if we assume the question is asking for the anion gap itself since the term "delta gap" is not standard and might be a misnomer or a typo. The anion gap we calculated is 8 mEq/L. If the question is asking for the delta ratio, we use the formula: Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - (Serum Creatinine - 2) From the patient's laboratory results upon admission, the serum creatinine level is 6.3 mg/dL. Now, let's calculate the delta ratio: Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - (Serum Creatinine - 2) Delta Ratio = 8 - (6.3 - 2) Delta Ratio = 8 - 4.3 Delta Ratio = 3.7 However, since the question specifically asks for the "delta gap," and given the context and the lack of a standard definition for "delta gap," I will assume the question is asking for the anion gap. So the anion gap is 8 mEq/L. But if the question is asking for the delta ratio (which is more commonly used), the answer would be 3.7. Since the term "delta gap" is not standard, I will provide the anion gap as the answer. The anion gap is 8 mEq/L. So the step-by-step thinking is as follows: 1. Identify the relevant lab values for calculating the anion gap: Sodium (134 mEq/L), Chloride (104 mEq/L), and Bicarbonate (22 mEq/L). 2. Use the formula for the anion gap: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). 3. Plug in the values: Anion Gap = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. 4. If the question is asking for the delta ratio, use the formula: Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - (Serum Creatinine - 2), where the serum creatinine is 6.3 mg/dL. 5. Calculate the delta ratio: Delta Ratio = 8 - (6.3 - 2) = 8 - 4.3 = 3.7. Since the term "delta gap" is not standard, I will assume the question is asking for the anion gap. Thus, the answer is 8 mEq/L for the anion gap. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the anion gap, we use the formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). From the patient's laboratory results upon admission, we have Sodium = 134 mEq/L, Chloride = 104 mEq/L, and Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: Anion Gap = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. If the question is asking for the delta ratio, the formula is Delta Ratio = Anion Gap - (Serum Creatinine - 2). The serum creatinine upon admission is 6.3 mg/dL. So, Delta Ratio = 8 - (6.3 - 2) = 8 - 4.3 = 3.7. Since the term 'delta gap' is not standard, I will assume it refers to the anion gap.", "answer": "8"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath for 3 days. He reports a slight fever and has also had 3 episodes of watery diarrhea earlier that morning. Last week, he attended a business meeting at a hotel and notes some of his coworkers have also become sick. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril. He appears in mild distress. His temperature is 102.1°F (38.9°C), pulse is 56/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Diffuse crackles are heard in the thorax.

Confusion (newly developed mental status change) 2. Urea level > 7 mmol/L (or > 80 mg/dL) 3. Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute 4. Blood pressure (systolic ≤ 90 mm Hg or diastolic ≤ 60 mm Hg) 5. Age 65 years or older Let's go through each criterion step-by-step using the information provided in the patient note. 1. **Confusion**: The patient appears in mild distress but there is no mention of confusion or any change in mental status. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Urea level**: The laboratory study shows a urea nitrogen level of 14 mg/dL. We need to convert this to mmol/L to compare it with the threshold of 7 mmol/L. The conversion factor is approximately 1 mg/dL of urea nitrogen = 0.357 mmol/L. So, \[ \text{Urea nitrogen (mmol/L)} = 14 \, \text{mg/dL} \times 0.357 \approx 5.0 \, \text{mmol/L}. \] Since 5.0 mmol/L is less than 7 mmol/L, this criterion is not met. 3. **Respiratory rate**: The patient's respiratory rate is 16/min. Since this is less than 30 breaths per minute, this criterion is not met. 4. **Blood pressure**: The patient's blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. The systolic blood pressure is 150 mm Hg, which is greater than 90 mm Hg, and the diastolic blood pressure is 85 mm Hg, which is greater than 60 mm Hg. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 5. **Age**: The patient is 62 years old. Since the patient is not 65 years or older, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea level > 7 mmol/L: No - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute: No - Blood pressure (systolic ≤ 90 mm Hg or diastolic ≤ 60 mm Hg): No - Age 65 years or older: No None of the criteria are met. Therefore, the CURB-65 score is 0. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Check for confusion: No mention of confusion, so 0 points. 2. Check the urea level: Urea nitrogen is 14 mg/dL, which converts to approximately 5.0 mmol/L, which is below the threshold of 7 mmol/L, so 0 points. 3. Check the respiratory rate: The respiratory rate is 16/min, which is below 30 breaths per minute, so 0 points. 4. Check the blood pressure: The blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg, which does not meet the criteria for low blood pressure (systolic ≤ 90 mm Hg or diastolic ≤ 60 mm Hg), so 0 points. 5. Check the age: The patient is 62 years old, which is below 65 years, so 0 points. Adding up the points, the total CURB-65 score is 0. Thus, the answer is 0. The JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we evaluate the following criteria: \n1. Confusion: No mention of confusion, so 0 points.\n2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L. On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection.

The PERC rule is used to rule out the need for further testing for pulmonary embolism in patients who present with suspected PE. The PERC rule consists of the following 8 criteria: 1. Age ≥ 50 years 2. Heart rate > 100 beats per minute 3. Oxygen saturation < 95% 4. History of malignancy (active or within 6 months of completion of treatment) 5. Previous PE or DVT 6. Hemoptysis 7. Surgery or trauma within the past 4 weeks 8. Signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on physical examination Let's evaluate the patient note against each of these criteria: 1. **Age ≥ 50 years**: The patient is 57 years old. This criterion is met. 2. **Heart rate > 100 beats per minute**: The patient's heart rate is 114 beats per minute. This criterion is met. 3. **Oxygen saturation < 95%**: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. This implies that the oxygen saturation was below 90% without oxygen supplementation, which is certainly below 95%. Therefore, this criterion is met. 4. **History of malignancy (active or within 6 months of completion of treatment)**: There is no mention of any history of malignancy in the patient note. This criterion is not met. 5. **Previous PE or DVT**: There is no mention of a previous PE or DVT in the patient note. This criterion is not met. 6. **Hemoptysis**: There is no mention of hemoptysis in the patient note. This criterion is not met. 7. **Surgery or trauma within the past 4 weeks**: There is no mention of any surgery or trauma within the past 4 weeks in the patient note. This criterion is not met. 8. **Signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on physical examination**: There is no mention of any signs of DVT in the patient note. This criterion is not met. Now, let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Age ≥ 50 years: Met - Heart rate > 100 beats per minute: Met - Oxygen saturation < 95%: Met - History of malignancy: Not met - Previous PE or DVT: Not met - Hemoptysis: Not met - Surgery or trauma within the past 4 weeks: Not met - Signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Not met So, the number of criteria met is 3 (Age ≥ 50 years, Heart rate > 100 beats per minute, Oxygen saturation < 95%). Therefore, the answer is 3.

The patient's weight is not explicitly provided in the patient note. However, we can use a standard formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements for adults. The formula often used is based on the patient's weight. The formula for maintenance fluid intake in adults is typically around 30-40 mL/kg/day. Since the patient's weight is not given in the note, I'll assume we need to use a standard weight for a healthy 22-year-old male. The average weight for a healthy 22-year-old male is approximately 70 kg. Let's use the formula to calculate the maintenance fluid requirement for a 70 kg individual. Step 1: Calculate the daily maintenance fluid requirement. Using the formula 30-40 mL/kg/day, let's use the midpoint for an average calculation, which is 35 mL/kg/day. For a 70 kg individual: Daily maintenance fluid = 70 kg * 35 mL/kg/day = 2450 mL/day. Step 2: Convert the daily maintenance fluid requirement to mL/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so we divide the daily requirement by 24 to get the hourly rate. Maintenance fluid in mL/hr = 2450 mL/day ÷ 24 hours/day ≈ 102.08 mL/hr. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 102 mL/hr. So, the maintenance fluid requirement for a 70 kg healthy 22-year-old male is approximately 102 mL/hr. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the maintenance fluid requirement, I first assumed the patient's weight since it wasn't provided in the note.

A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

Step 1: Evaluate the Eye Opening component. The note says that upon a sternal rub, the patient's eyes "slightly opened." According to the Glasgow Coma Scale, this corresponds to: - 4: Spontaneous eye opening - 3: Eye opening to verbal command - 2: Eye opening to pain (like a sternal rub) - 1: No eye opening Since the patient's eyes opened in response to a sternal rub, the Eye Opening score is 2. Step 2: Evaluate the Verbal Response component. The note states that the patient "remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests." This indicates that the patient did not make any verbal sounds or responses. According to the Glasgow Coma Scale for Verbal Response: - 5: Oriented - 4: Confused - 3: Inappropriate words - 2: Incomprehensible sounds - 1: No verbal response Since the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests, the Verbal Response score is 1. Step 3: Evaluate the Motor Response component. The note mentions that the patient's limbs "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement" in response to the sternal rub. According to the Glasgow Coma Scale for Motor Response: - 6: Obeys commands - 5: Localizes to pain - 4: Withdraws from pain - 3: Flexion (decorticate posturing) - 2: Extension (decerebrate posturing) - 1: No motor response The description of "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement" suggests an extension movement in response to pain. This corresponds to a score of 2 on the Motor Response component. Now, we add up the scores from each component: - Eye Opening: 2 - Verbal Response: 1 - Motor Response: 2 The total Glasgow Coma Score is \(2 + 1 + 2 = 5\).

The Rautaharju formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times (\text{HR} - 62) \] where: - \(\text{QT}\) is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - \(\text{HR}\) is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). From the patient note, we have: - The heart rate (\(\text{HR}\)) = 79 bpm. - The QT interval (\(\text{QT}\)) = 330 msec. Now, let's plug these values into the Rautaharju formula step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate \(\text{HR} - 62\). \[ \text{HR} - 62 = 79 - 62 = 17. \] Step 2: Multiply this result by 0.154. \[ 0.154 \times 17 = 2.618. \] Step 3: Add this result to the measured QT interval. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = 330 + 2.618. \] Step 4: Perform the addition. \[ 330 + 2.618 = 332.618. \] Since the QTc interval is typically reported to the nearest whole number, we round 332.618 to the nearest whole number, which is 333. Therefore, the corrected QT interval using the Rautaharju formula is 333 msec. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the given values: \(\text{QT} = 330\) msec and \(\text{HR} = 79\) bpm. 2. Use the Rautaharju formula: \(\text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times (\text{HR} - 62)\). 3. Calculate \(\text{HR} - 62\): \(79 - 62 = 17\). 4. Multiply the result by 0.154: \(0.154 \times 17 = 2.618\). 5. Add this result to the measured QT interval: \(330 + 2.618 = 332.618\). 6.

A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute.

Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.

Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks.

The blood pressure while supine is 89/52 mm Hg. The blood pressure while standing is 69/40 mm Hg. We need to calculate the mean arterial pressure for both positions and then determine which one is relevant to the task. Since the question does not specify the position, I will calculate the MAP for both positions and then decide based on the context. 1. Calculate the MAP while supine: \[ \text{MAP}_{\text{supine}} = \frac{2 \times \text{Diastolic Pressure}_{\text{supine}} + \text{Systolic Pressure}_{\text{supine}}}{3} \] Plugging in the values for the supine position (89/52 mm Hg): \[ \text{MAP}_{\text{supine}} = \frac{2 \times 52 + 89}{3} = \frac{104 + 89}{3} = \frac{193}{3} \approx 64.33 \, \text{mm Hg} \] 2. Calculate the MAP while standing: \[ \text{MAP}_{\text{standing}} = \frac{2 \times \text{Diastolic Pressure}_{\text{standing}} + \text{Systolic Pressure}_{\text{standing}}}{3} \] Plugging in the values for the standing position (69/40 mm Hg): \[ \text{MAP}_{\text{standing}} = \frac{2 \times 40 + 69}{3} = \frac{80 + 69}{3} = \frac{149}{3} \approx 49.67 \, \text{mm Hg} \] Since the patient was rushed to the hospital after an episode of syncope, and the blood pressure measurements were taken in the hospital, it is likely that the supine position is the more relevant one for calculating the mean arterial pressure at the time of admission. Therefore, the mean arterial pressure while supine is approximately 64.33 mm Hg. Thus, the most appropriate answer is the MAP while supine. So the mean arterial pressure is approximately 64.33 mm Hg. Since we typically round to the nearest whole number for such measurements, the MAP is approximately 64 mm Hg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP), we use the formula: \[ \\text{MAP} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Diastolic Pressure} + \\text{Systolic Pressure}}{3} \\] From the patient note, we have two blood pressure readings: one while the patient was supine (89/52 mm Hg) and another while standing (69/40 mm Hg).

The Bazett formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where QT is the QT interval in milliseconds (msec), and RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (which is the inverse of the heart rate in seconds). Given: - The patient's heart rate is 72 bpm (beats per minute). - The QT interval is 330 msec. First, we need to convert the heart rate to the RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 72 bpm. The RR interval in seconds is the time between two consecutive heartbeats. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the RR interval in seconds is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}} = \frac{60}{72} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we can use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}}.\] Let's calculate the square root of \(\frac{5}{6}\): \[ \sqrt{\frac{5}{6}} \approx \sqrt{0.8333} \approx 0.9128. \] Now we can plug this value into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.9128} \approx 361.5. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 362 msec. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. We have the given values: QT interval = 330 msec and heart rate = 72 bpm. 2. Convert the heart rate to the RR interval in seconds: \(\text{RR} = \frac{60}{72} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333 \, \text{seconds}.\) 3. Use the Bazett formula: \(\text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}}}.\) 4. Calculate \(\sqrt{\frac{5}{6}} \approx \sqrt{0.8333} \approx 0.9128.\) 5. Plug this into the formula: \(\text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.9128} \approx 361.5.\) 6. Round to the nearest whole number to get the corrected QT interval as approximately 362 msec. Thus, the patient's corrected QT interval is 362 msec. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we use the formula: \[ \\text{QTc}_\\text{Bazett} = \\frac{\\text{QT}}{\\sqrt{\\text{RR}}}. \\] Given: - QT interval = 330 msec - Heart rate = 72 bpm.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL).

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

The FeverPAIN score is a scoring system used to assess the severity of a patient's condition, particularly in cases of suspected retropharyngeal abscess or other neck infections. The components of the FeverPAIN score are: - Fever - Pain - Age - Inability to swallow - Neck mass - Trismus Each component is scored as follows: - Fever: 1 point if the patient has a fever (temperature > 38°C or 100.4°F). - Pain: 1 point if the patient has severe pain. - Age: 1 point if the patient is younger than 5 years old. - Inability to swallow: 1 point if the patient has difficulty swallowing. - Neck mass: 1 point if there is a palpable neck mass. - Trismus: 1 point if the patient has trismus (limited mouth opening). Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **Fever**: The patient has a "low-grade fever." A low-grade fever typically indicates a temperature above normal but not extremely high. Since the patient has a fever, this component scores 1 point. 2. **Pain**: The patient presented with "severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days." This indicates severe pain, so this component scores 1 point. 3. **Age**: The patient is 28 years old. Since the patient is not younger than 5 years old, this component scores 0 points. 4. **Inability to swallow**: The patient has "painful swallowing," which suggests difficulty swallowing. Therefore, this component scores 1 point. 5. **Neck mass**: The note mentions "tenderness in the left side of the neck," but it does not explicitly mention a palpable neck mass. Therefore, we will score this component as 0 points. 6. **Trismus**: There is no mention of trismus (limited mouth opening) in the patient note. Therefore, this component scores 0 points. Now, let's add up the points: - Fever: 1 point - Pain: 1 point - Age: 0 points - Inability to swallow: 1 point - Neck mass: 0 points - Trismus: 0 points Total FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3. So, the patient's FeverPAIN score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to evaluate each component of the FeverPAIN score for the given patient. The components are Fever, Pain, Age, Inability to swallow, Neck mass, and Trismus. Here's the breakdown: 1. **Fever**: The patient has a \"low-grade fever.\" This indicates the presence of a fever, so this component scores 1 point. 2. **Pain**: The patient has \"severe neck pain,\" indicating severe pain. Therefore, this component scores 1 point. 3. **Age**: The patient is 28 years old. Since the patient is not younger than 5 years old, this component scores 0 points. 4. **Inability to swallow**: The patient has \"painful swallowing,\" which suggests difficulty swallowing. Therefore, this component scores 1 point. 5. **Neck mass**: The note mentions \"tenderness in the left side of the neck,\" but it does not explicitly mention a palpable neck mass. Therefore, this component scores 0 points. 6. **Trismus**: There is no mention of trismus (limited mouth opening). Therefore, this component scores 0 points.

The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.\nThe bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between 07/18/2010 and 02/09/2011. We'll break this down step by step. - The LMP is July 18, 2010. - Today's date is February 9, 2011. Let's calculate the number of days from July 18, 2010, to December 31, 2010, and then from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011. **Step 1: Calculate the number of days remaining in July 2010 after July 18, 2010.** July has 31 days. If the LMP is July 18, the number of days remaining in July is: \[ 31 - 18 = 13 \, \text{days}.\] **Step 2: Calculate the total number of days in August through December 2010.** - August has 31 days. - September has 30 days. - October has 31 days. - November has 30 days. - December has 31 days. Adding these up: \[ 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 153 \, \text{days}.\] **Step 3: Add the days from Step 1 and Step 2 to get the total number of days from July 18, 2010, to December 31, 2010.** \[ 13 \, (\text{remaining days in July}) + 153 \, (\text{days from August to December}) = 166 \, \text{days}.\] **Step 4: Calculate the number of days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011.** - January has 31 days. - From January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. - From February 1 to February 9 is 9 days. So the total number of days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011, is: \[ 31 \, (\text{days in January}) + 9 \, (\text{days in February up to February 9}) = 40 \, \text{days}.\] **Step 5: Add the number of days from July 18, 2010, to December 31, 2010, and the number of days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011.** \[ 166 \, (\text{days from July 18, 2010, to December 31, 2010}) + 40 \, (\text{days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011}) = 206 \, \text{days}.\] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 206 days. Now, we convert 206 days into weeks and days. Since there are 7 days in a week: \[ \text{Number of weeks} = \left\lfloor \frac{206}{7} \right\rfloor. \] \[ \left\lfloor \frac{206}{7} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 29.4286 \right\rfloor = 29 \, \text{weeks}. \] To find the number of remaining days: \[ \text{Remaining days} = 206 - (29 \times 7). \] Calculate \( 29 \times 7 = 203. \) So, \[ \text{Remaining days} = 206 - 203 = 3 \, \text{days}. \] Therefore, the estimated gestational age is 29 weeks and 3 days. The answer is \((29 \, \text{weeks}, 3 \, \text{days})\).

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The anion gap is given as 30 mmol/L.

The delta gap is calculated using the formula: Delta Gap = Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mmol/L.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario. Here is the task: What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for this patient, we need to evaluate the patient's condition across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, CNS (Central Nervous System), and Renal. We will calculate the score for each system based on the given information. Step 1: Respiratory System The score is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio or the use of mechanical ventilation. - PaO₂ = 77 mm Hg - FiO₂ = 54% or 0.54 - PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio = 77 / 0.54 ≈ 142.59 According to the SOFA scoring system for the respiratory system: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: Score = 0 - 300-400: Score = 1 - 200-300: Score = 2 - 100-200: Score = 3 - <100: Score = 4 Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 142.59, it falls into the range 100-200. Therefore, the score for the Respiratory system is 3. Step 2: Coagulation System The score is based on the platelet count. - Platelet count = 180,000/µL According to the SOFA scoring system for the coagulation system: - > 150,000: Score = 0 - 100,000-150,000: Score = 1 - 50,000-100,000: Score = 2 - 20,000-50,000: Score = 3 - < 20,000: Score = 4 Since the platelet count is 180,000/µL, it falls into the range > 150,000. Therefore, the score for the Coagulation system is 0. Step 3: Liver System The score is based on the bilirubin level. - Bilirubin = 1.7 mg/dL According to the SOFA scoring system for the liver system: - < 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2-1.9: Score = 1 - 2-5.9: Score = 2 - 6-11.9: Score = 3 - ≥ 12: Score = 4 Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2-1.9. Therefore, the score for the Liver system is 1. Step 4: Cardiovascular System The score is based on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the use of vasopressors. The patient is on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min respectively, and norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. To determine the score, we need to consider the vasopressor use and the mean arterial pressure (MAP). The blood pressure is given as 120/80 mm Hg. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated using the formula: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{2 \times \text{Diastolic BP} + \text{Systolic BP}}{3} \] Using the given blood pressure (120/80 mm Hg): \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{2 \times 80 + 120}{3} = \frac{160 + 120}{3} = \frac{280}{3} \approx 93.3 \, \text{mm Hg} \] Now, let's evaluate the vasopressor use: - NorEPINEPHrine is used at 0.07 mcg/kg/min. - EPINEPHrine is used at 0.03 mcg/kg/min. The total vasopressor use is the sum of the doses of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine since dopamine and dobutamine are inotropic agents and not typically counted for the vasopressor score in the SOFA system. Total vasopressor dose = 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min. According to the SOFA scoring system for the cardiovascular system: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg: Score = 0 - No vasopressors and MAP < 70 mm Hg, or vasopressors required to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg with a dose of dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or an equivalent: Score = 1 - Vasopressors required with a dopamine dose ≥ 5 mcg/kg/min or an equivalent: Score = 2 - Vasopressors required with a dopamine dose > 15 mcg/kg/min or an equivalent: Score = 3 - Vasopressors required with a dose of dopamine or an equivalent > 20 mcg/kg/min, or any dose of noradrenaline or adrenaline: Score = 4 Since the patient is using norEPINEPHrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) and EPINEPHrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min), both of which are potent vasopressors, we need to convert these to the equivalent dopamine dose. The conversion factors are: - Noradrenaline (norepinephrine): 1 mcg/kg/min of noradrenaline is roughly equivalent to 10 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. - Adrenaline (epinephrine): 1 mcg/kg/min of adrenaline is roughly equivalent to 10 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. So, - NorEPINEPHrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) is equivalent to 0.07 * 10 = 0.7 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. - EPINEPHrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min) is equivalent to 0.03 * 10 = 0.3 mcg/kg/min of dopamine. Adding these together gives the total equivalent dopamine dose: \[ \text{Total equivalent dopamine dose} = 0.7 + 0.3 = 1.0 \, \text{mcg/kg/min} \] Since the patient is using vasopressors (norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine), and the total equivalent dopamine dose is 1.0 mcg/kg/min, this falls into the category where vasopressors are required to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg with a dose of dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or an equivalent. Therefore, the score for the Cardiovascular system is 1. Step 5: CNS (Central Nervous System) The score is based on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). - GCS = 13 According to the SOFA scoring system for the CNS: - GCS 15: Score = 0 - GCS 13-14: Score = 1 - GCS 10-12: Score = 2 - GCS 6-9: Score = 3 - GCS < 6: Score = 4 Since the GCS is 13, the score for the CNS is 1. Step 6: Renal System The score is based on the serum creatinine level or urine output. - Serum creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - Urine output = 925 mL/day According to the SOFA scoring system for the renal system: - Urine output > 200 mL/day and creatinine < 1.2: Score = 0 - Urine output > 200 mL/day and creatinine 1.2-1.9: Score = 1 - Urine output > 200 mL/day and creatinine 2-3.4: Score = 2 - Urine output > 200 mL/day and creatinine > 3.5: Score = 3 - Urine output ≤ 200 mL/day: Score = 4 Since the urine output is 925 mL/day (which is > 200 mL/day) and the creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range where the creatinine is 1.2-1.9. Therefore, the score for the Renal system is 1. Now, we sum up the scores from all the systems: - Respiratory: 3 - Coagulation: 0 - Liver: 1 - Cardiovascular: 1 - CNS: 1 - Renal: 1 Total SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is 7. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for this patient, we need to evaluate the patient's condition across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, CNS (Central Nervous System), and Renal.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

From the given laboratory values: - Sodium (Na) = 135 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl) = 103 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 19 mmol/L Now, let's calculate the anion gap: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 \, \text{mmol/L} \] The normal range for the anion gap is typically between 8-16 mmol/L, so the calculated anion gap of 13 mmol/L is within the normal range. Next, we need to calculate the delta gap. The delta gap is calculated using the formula: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} - \text{Normal Anion Gap} + \Delta \text{HCO}_3 \] The normal anion gap is usually around 12 mmol/L. The change in bicarbonate (\(\Delta \text{HCO}_3\)) is the difference between the measured bicarbonate and the normal bicarbonate level. The normal bicarbonate level is typically around 24 mmol/L. So, \[ \Delta \text{HCO}_3 = \text{Normal HCO}_3 - \text{Measured HCO}_3 = 24 - 19 = 5 \, \text{mmol/L} \] Now we can plug these values into the formula for the delta gap: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} - \text{Normal Anion Gap} + \Delta \text{HCO}_3 \] Using the values we have: - Anion Gap = 13 mmol/L - Normal Anion Gap = 12 mmol/L - \(\Delta \text{HCO}_3 = 5 \, \text{mmol/L}\) So, \[ \text{Delta Gap} = 13 - 12 + 5 = 6 \, \text{mmol/L} \] Thus, the patient's delta gap is 6 mEq/L. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the anion gap using the formula: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{[Na]} - (\text{[Cl]} + \text{[HCO}_3\text{]}) \] - Given: \[ \text{[Na]} = 135 \, \text{mmol/L}, \, \text{[Cl]} = 103 \, \text{mmol/L}, \, \text{[HCO}_3] = 19 \, \text{mmol/L} \] - Anion Gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 \, \text{mmol/L}. 2. Determine the normal anion gap, which is typically around 12 mmol/L. 3. Calculate the change in bicarbonate (\(\Delta \text{HCO}_3\)): - Normal HCO3 = 24 mmol/L - Measured HCO3 = 19 mmol/L - \(\Delta \text{HCO}_3 = 24 - 19 = 5 \, \text{mmol/L}\). 4. Use the formula for the delta gap: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} - \text{Normal Anion Gap} + \Delta \text{HCO}_3 \] - Plugging in the values: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = 13 - 12 + 5 = 6 \, \text{mmol/L}. \] Therefore, the patient's delta gap is 6 mEq/L. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, we first need to calculate the anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]). Given the values: Sodium (Na) = 135 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl) = 103 mmol/L, and Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 19 mmol/L. The anion gap is calculated as: Anion Gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 mmol/L. Next, we need to calculate the delta gap using the formula: Delta Gap = Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap + ΔHCO3. The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mmol/L. The change in bicarbonate (ΔHCO3) is the difference between the normal bicarbonate level (typically 24 mmol/L) and the measured bicarbonate level (19 mmol/L). So, ΔHCO3 = 24 - 19 = 5 mmol/L. Now, we plug these values into the delta gap formula: Delta Gap = 13 - 12 + 5 = 6 mmol/L. Therefore, the patient's delta gap is 6 mEq/L.", "answer": "6"}

The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.\nUpon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.\nFollowing termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.', 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': '226.07', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': 'No Explanation', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '6', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the delta gap, we first need to calculate the anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = [Na] - ([Cl] + [HCO3]).

Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the parameters from the given patient note. - Age: 73 years old. - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 15. - Body Temperature: 37.2°C (normal). - Blood Pressure: 138/92 mmHg. We need to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). The formula for MAP is: MAP = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3. So, MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = (184 + 138) / 3 = 322 / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. - Respiratory Rate: 35 breaths per minute. - PaO2: 78 mmHg. - A-a gradient: 331 mmHg. - Hematocrit: 41%. - White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 15,105 cells/µL (which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL). - Sodium: 143.21 mmol/L (approximately 143 mmol/L). - Potassium: 3.68 mmol/L (approximately 3.7 mmol/L). - Creatinine: 4.58 mg/dL. We also need to calculate the PaCO2 or use the A-a gradient to determine the respiratory component. Since we have the A-a gradient and not PaCO2, we will use the respiratory rate and A-a gradient to determine the respiratory score. Step 2: Calculate the APACHE II score for each parameter. 1. Age: - The patient is 73 years old. The APACHE II scoring for age is as follows: - 1 point for 16-44 years - 2 points for 45-54 years - 3 points for 55-64 years - 4 points for 65-74 years - 5 points for ≥ 75 years Since the patient is 73 years old, the score is 4 points. 2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): The patient has a GCS of 15. The APACHE II scoring for GCS is: - 1 point for GCS 15 So, the score is 1 point. 3. Body Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C. The APACHE II scoring for temperature is: - 0 points for 36-38°C Since 37.2°C falls within the range of 36-38°C, the score is 0 points. 4. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): The calculated MAP is 107.3 mmHg. The APACHE II scoring for MAP is: - 0 points for MAP 70-110 mmHg Since 107.3 mmHg falls within the range of 70-110 mmHg, the score is 0 points. 5. Respiratory Rate and A-a Gradient: The respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and the A-a gradient is 331 mmHg. For the respiratory component, we use the A-a gradient if it is provided. The APACHE II scoring for the respiratory system uses either PaCO2 or the A-a gradient. Since we have the A-a gradient, we use that. The scoring for the A-a gradient is as follows: - 0 points for A-a gradient < 30 mmHg - 1 point for 30-99 mmHg - 2 points for 100-199 mmHg - 3 points for 200-299 mmHg - 4 points for ≥ 300 mmHg Since the A-a gradient is 331 mmHg, which is ≥ 300 mmHg, the score is 4 points. 6. White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL, which is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL. The APACHE II scoring for WBC is: - 0 points for 4-13.9 x 10^3 cells/µL - 1 point for 14-29.9 x 10^3 cells/µL - 2 points for 30-99.9 x 10^3 cells/µL - 3 points for ≥ 100 x 10^3 cells/µL or < 4 x 10^3 cells/µL Since the WBC count is 15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL, it falls within the range of 14-29.9 x 10^3 cells/µL, so the score is 1 point. 7. Sodium: The sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L, which is approximately 143 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for sodium is: - 0 points for 135-155 mmol/L Since 143 mmol/L falls within the range of 135-155 mmol/L, the score is 0 points. 8. Potassium: The potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L, which is approximately 3.7 mmol/L. The APACHE II scoring for potassium is: - 0 points for 3.5-5.4 mmol/L Since 3.7 mmol/L falls within the range of 3.5-5.4 mmol/L, the score is 0 points. 9. Creatinine: The creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. The APACHE II scoring for creatinine is: - 0 points for < 1.2 mg/dL - 1 point for 1.2-1.9 mg/dL - 2 points for 2.0-2.9 mg/dL - 3 points for 3.0-4.9 mg/dL - 4 points for ≥ 5.0 mg/dL Since the creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 3.0-4.9 mg/dL, so the score is 3 points. Now, we sum up the scores from the parameters we have calculated: - Age: 4 points - GCS: 1 point - Temperature: 0 points - MAP: 0 points - Respiratory (A-a gradient): 4 points - WBC: 1 point - Sodium: 0 points - Potassium: 0 points - Creatinine: 3 points Total score from these parameters = 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 13 points. Next, we need to add the APACHE II severity points for the underlying conditions. The patient has the following conditions: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and liver cirrhosis. The APACHE II scoring assigns points for the underlying conditions as follows: - 1 point for each of the following: liver disease, metastatic cancer, AIDS, immunosuppression, and hematologic malignancy. Since the patient has liver cirrhosis (which is considered liver disease), he gets 1 point for this condition. So, the total APACHE II score = 13 (from the parameters) + 1 (for liver cirrhosis) = 14 points. Therefore, the patient's APACHE II score is 14. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score, we identified the following parameters from the patient note:\n- Age: 73 years old.\n- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 15.\n- Body Temperature: 37.2°C.\n- Blood Pressure: 138/92 mmHg, which gives a MAP of 107.3 mmHg.\n- Respiratory Rate: 35 breaths per minute.\n- A-a gradient: 331 mmHg.\n- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 15,105 cells/µL (15.1 x 10^3 cells/µL).\n- Sodium: 143.21 mmol/L (approximately 143 mmol/L).\n- Potassium: 3.68 mmol/L (approximately 3.7 mmol/L).\n- Creatinine: 4.58 mg/dL.\n\nWe then calculated the APACHE II score for each parameter:\n1.

Respiratory (using A-a gradient): 4 points (for A-a gradient ≥ 300 mmHg).\n6. WBC: 1 point (for 14-29.9 x 10^3 cells/µL).\n7. Sodium: 0 points (for 135-155 mmol/L).\n8. Potassium: 0 points (for 3.5-5.4 mmol/L).\n9. Creatinine: 3 points (for 3.0-4.9 mg/dL).\n\nSumming these scores gives us: 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 13 points.\n\nSince the patient has liver cirrhosis (which is considered liver disease), we add 1 point for this underlying condition.\n\nTherefore, the total APACHE II score = 13 + 1 = 14 points.", "answer": "14"}

The patient is reported to have an organ failure of immunocompromise with a surgery type being classified as Nonoperative . Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14.

A 59-year-old gentleman presents with episodes of dizziness and palpitations. His past medical history is significant for a previous stroke and uncontrolled hypertension (182/111). Blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80 % of the time. A significant bleeding event that happened following a minor operative procedure is documented and requires careful attention. His lifestyle habits include moderate alcohol consumption, tallying approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. Despite the other complexities, the liver function tests appear normal suggesting no liver disease, and similar is the case with his renal function tests showing no kidney impairment. His case is closely following up considering all the clinically important traits.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those on anticoagulation therapy. The HAS-BLED score includes the following components: - H (Hypertension): defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg. - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function): abnormal renal function or liver function. - S (Stroke): history of stroke. - B (Bleeding): previous bleeding event. - L (Labile INR): labile international normalized ratio (INR). - E (Elderly): age > 65 years. - D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly): concomitant use of drugs or alcohol. Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has uncontrolled hypertension with a reading of 182/111 mmHg. Since the systolic BP is > 160 mmHg and the diastolic BP is > 100 mmHg, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function):** The patient's liver function tests appear normal, and there is no kidney impairment as indicated by normal renal function tests. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 3. **S (Stroke):** The patient has a past medical history of a previous stroke. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 4. **B (Bleeding):** There is a documented significant bleeding event that occurred following a minor operative procedure. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 5. **L (Labile INR):** The blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80% of the time. This indicates instability in the INR, so this criterion is met. Score = 1. 6. **E (Elderly):** The patient is 59 years old. Since the criterion for being elderly is age > 65 years, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 7. **D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly):** The patient has moderate alcohol consumption, approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. This criterion is met because of the alcohol consumption. Score = 1. Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - H (Hypertension) = 1 - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function) = 0 - S (Stroke) = 1 - B (Bleeding) = 1 - L (Labile INR) = 1 - E (Elderly) = 0 - D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) = 1 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 5. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Evaluate Hypertension (H): The patient has a blood pressure of 182/111 mmHg, which meets the criteria for hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mmHg and diastolic BP > 100 mmHg). Score = 1. 2. Evaluate Abnormal Renal/Liver function (A): The patient has normal liver function tests and no kidney impairment. This criterion is not met. Score = 0. 3. Evaluate Stroke (S): The patient has a history of a previous stroke. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 4. Evaluate Bleeding (B): There is a documented significant bleeding event following a minor operative procedure. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 5. Evaluate Labile INR (L): The patient has a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80% of the time. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 6. Evaluate Elderly (E): The patient is 59 years old, which does not meet the criterion for being elderly (age > 65 years). Score = 0. 7. Evaluate Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (D): The patient consumes moderate alcohol (approximately three alcoholic beverages per week), meeting this criterion. Score = 1. Adding these scores together: 1 (H) + 0 (A) + 1 (S) + 1 (B) + 1 (L) + 0 (E) + 1 (D) = 5. So the final HAS-BLED score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components: H (Hypertension), A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function), S (Stroke), B (Bleeding), L (Labile INR), E (Elderly), and D (Drugs/alcohol concomitantly).

The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}} \] where: - QT is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (the heart rate interval), which can be calculated from the heart rate. The heart rate is given as 170 bpm (beats per minute). We need to convert this heart rate into the RR interval in seconds. The formula to convert heart rate to the RR interval is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}}. \] Given the heart rate is 170 bpm: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{170} \approx 0.3529 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we have the QT interval as 330 msec and the RR interval as approximately 0.3529 seconds. We will plug these values into the Fridericia formula: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt[3]{0.3529}}. \] Next, we need to calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt[3]{0.3529} \approx 0.7066. \] Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval (QTcF): \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{330}{0.7066} \approx 466.99. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 467 msec. So the patient's corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula is approximately 467 msec. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Convert the heart rate (170 bpm) to the RR interval in seconds. \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{170} \approx 0.3529 \, \text{seconds}. \] 2. Use the Fridericia formula for the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}}. \] 3. Plug in the values: QT = 330 msec and RR = 0.3529 seconds. \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{330}{\sqrt[3]{0.3529}}. \] 4. Calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt[3]{0.3529} \approx 0.7066. \] 5. Now calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTcF} = \frac{330}{0.7066} \approx 466.99. \] 6. Round the result to the nearest whole number to get 467 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 467 msec. The final answer is 467.

The formula to convert heart rate to the RR interval is: \\\\[ \\\\text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \\\\frac{60}{\\\\text{heart rate (in bpm)}}. \\\\] Given the heart rate is 170 bpm: \\\\[ \\\\text{RR interval} = \\\\frac{60}{170} \\\\approx 0.3529 \\\\, \\\\text{seconds}. \\\\] Now we have the QT interval as 330 msec and the RR interval as approximately 0.3529 seconds. We will plug these values into the Fridericia formula: \\\\[ \\\\text{QTcF} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{QT}}{\\\\sqrt[3]{\\\\text{RR}}} = \\\\frac{330}{\\\\sqrt[3]{0.3529}}. \\\\] Next, we need to calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \\\\[ \\\\sqrt[3]{0.3529} \\\\approx 0.7066. \\\\] Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval (QTcF): \\\\[ \\\\text{QTcF} = \\\\frac{330}{0.7066} \\\\approx 466.99. \\\\] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 467 msec. So the patient's corrected QT interval using the Fridericia formula is approximately 467 msec.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '466.934', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).\nThe patient's heart rate is 170 beats per minute.\nThe QT interval is 330 msec.\nThe RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/170 = 0.353.\nHence, plugging in these values, we will get 330/√(0.353) = 466.934.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 466.934 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

Total Bilirubin 2. Serum Albumin 3. Prothrombin Time (INR can be used to calculate this) 4. Presence of Ascites 5. Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy The Child-Pugh Score categorizes liver disease severity into classes A, B, and C based on these parameters. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Evaluate Total Bilirubin. The given value for bilirubin is 40.2 umol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL because the Child-Pugh criteria use mg/dL for bilirubin. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 17.1 umol/L. So, \[ \text{Bilirubin in mg/dL} = \frac{40.2 \, \text{umol/L}}{17.1} \approx 2.35 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] According to the Child-Pugh criteria for bilirubin: - Class 1: < 2 mg/dL - Class 2: 2-3 mg/dL - Class 3: 3-6 mg/dL - Class 4: > 6 mg/dL Since 2.35 mg/dL falls within the range of 2-3 mg/dL, the score for Bilirubin is Class 2. Step 2: Evaluate Serum Albumin. The given value for albumin is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh criteria for albumin: - Class 1: > 3.5 g/dL - Class 2: 2.8-3.5 g/dL - Class 3: 2.1-2.8 g/dL - Class 4: < 2.1 g/dL Since the albumin level is 3.1 g/dL, it falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so the score for Albumin is Class 2. Step 3: Evaluate Prothrombin Time (INR). The given value for INR is 2.1. According to the Child-Pugh criteria for INR (or prothrombin time): - Class 1: < 1.7 - Class 2: 1.7-2.3 - Class 3: 2.4-3.0 - Class 4: > 3.0 Since the INR is 2.1, it falls within the range of 1.7-2.3, so the score for INR is Class 2. Step 4: Evaluate the Presence of Ascites. The abdominal exam is negative for ascites. Therefore, the score for Ascites is Class 1 (none or controlled). Step 5: Evaluate the Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy. The patient is oriented only to self, which indicates some degree of confusion or altered mental status. This suggests the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is classified as follows: - Class 1: None - Class 2: Grade 1 (Minimal changes in behavior, mild confusion) - Class 3: Grade 2 (Obvious confusion, sleep pattern disturbances) - Class 4: Grade 3-4 (Stupor, coma) Since the patient is oriented only to self, this indicates a significant level of confusion, likely corresponding to at least Grade 2 or higher hepatic encephalopathy. For simplicity and based on the information provided, we will assume it corresponds to Class 2 or higher. However, since the exact grading isn't specified, we'll use the information that the patient is confused and not oriented to place this in a higher category. Given the patient's confusion and orientation only to self, we can classify this as Class 2 or higher. Let's assume it is at least Class 2 (Grade 1). But to be more precise, let's consider the classification: - Class 1: None - Class 2: Controlled by medication - Class 3: Present without treatment or not fully controlled by medication Since the patient is confused and not oriented to place and time, this suggests at least Class 2 or higher. Let's assume it is Class 2 for now. Now, let's sum up the scores for each parameter: - Bilirubin: Class 2 - Albumin: Class 2 - INR: Class 2 - Ascites: Class 1 (none or controlled) - Hepatic Encephalopathy: Let's assume Class 2 (since the patient is confused and oriented only to self). Now we assign the points according to the Child-Pugh scoring system: - Class 1 = 1 point - Class 2 = 2 points - Class 3 = 3 points - Class 4 = 4 points So the scores are: - Bilirubin (Class 2): 2 points - Albumin (Class 2): 2 points - INR (Class 2): 2 points - Ascites (Class 1): 1 point - Hepatic Encephalopathy (Class 2): 2 points Now, we add up these points: \[ 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) + 1 (Ascites) + 2 (Hepatic Encephalopathy) = 9. \] According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. However, the question asks for the Child-Pugh Score, which is the sum of the points. Thus, the Child-Pugh Score is 9. So the final answer is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: Total Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, Prothrombin Time (INR), Presence of Ascites, and Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate Total Bilirubin.\nThe given value for bilirubin is 40.2 umol/L. Convert this to mg/dL: \[ \text{Bilirubin in mg/dL} = \frac{40.2 \, \text{umol/L}}{17.1} \approx 2.35 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] According to the Child-Pugh criteria for bilirubin, 2.35 mg/dL falls within the range of 2-3 mg/dL, so the score for Bilirubin is Class 2.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Serum Albumin.\nThe given value for albumin is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh criteria for albumin, 3.1 g/dL falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so the score for Albumin is Class 2.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Prothrombin Time (INR).\nThe given value for INR is 2.1. According to the Child-Pugh criteria for INR, 2.1 falls within the range of 1.7-2.3, so the score for INR is Class 2.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the Presence of Ascites.\nThe abdominal exam is negative for ascites. Therefore, the score for Ascites is Class 1 (none or controlled).\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy.\nThe patient is oriented only to self, indicating some degree of confusion or altered mental status, suggesting the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. We will assume it corresponds to Class 2 (since the patient is confused).\n\nNow, let's assign the points for each parameter according to the Child-Pugh scoring system:\n- Bilirubin (Class 2): 2 points\n- Albumin (Class 2): 2 points\n- INR (Class 2): 2 points\n- Ascites (Class 1): 1 point\n- Hepatic Encephalopathy (Class 2): 2 points\n\nAdding these points together: \[ 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9. \]\nAccording to the Child-Pugh classification, a score of 9 corresponds to Child-Pugh Class B.\nThus, the Child-Pugh Score is 9.", "answer": "9"}

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

The SIRS criteria include the following: 1. Temperature > 38°C or < 36°C. 2. Heart rate > 90 beats per minute. 3. Respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg. 4. White blood cell count > 12,000/mm³ or < 4,000/mm³ or > 10% immature (band) forms. Let's evaluate each criterion based on the information provided in the patient note: 1. **Temperature**: The patient's body temperature is 38.5°C. This is > 38°C, so this criterion is met. 2. **Heart Rate**: The patient's heart rate is 68 beats per minute. This is not > 90 beats per minute, so this criterion is not met. 3. **Respiratory Rate or PaCO2**: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. This is exactly 20 breaths per minute, which means it does not exceed 20 breaths per minute. The arterial blood gas analysis shows PCO2 = 36.3 mm Hg, which is not < 32 mm Hg. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 4. **White Blood Cell Count**: The white blood cell count is 8,000/mm³. This is not > 12,000/mm³ and not < 4,000/mm³. Additionally, the differential count shows 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. There is no mention of an increase in immature (band) forms. Therefore, this criterion is not met. So, let's count the number of SIRS criteria met: - Temperature: Met (1 criterion) - Heart Rate: Not met - Respiratory Rate or PaCO2: Not met - White Blood Cell Count: Not met Thus, the patient meets 1 criterion out of the 4 SIRS criteria.

Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment.

Thus, the patient meets 1 SIRS criterion.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's heart rate is 68.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 36.3 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg.

Step 1: Understand the conversion factor between Hydrocortisone and Prednisone. Hydrocortisone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids, but they have different potencies. The general conversion factor is that 5 mg of Prednisone is roughly equivalent to 25 mg of Hydrocortisone. This means that 1 mg of Prednisone is approximately equal to 5 mg of Hydrocortisone. Rewriting the conversion factor, we get: \[ 1 \, \text{mg Prednisone} = 5 \, \text{mg Hydrocortisone}. \] To find out how many mg of Prednisone is equivalent to 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone, we use the conversion factor: \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose (mg)} = \frac{\text{Hydrocortisone dose (mg)}}{5}. \] Now, we plug in the given dose of Hydrocortisone: \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose (mg)} = \frac{152.535}{5}. \] Perform the division: \[ \frac{152.535}{5} = 30.507. \] So, the equivalent dosage of 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV in mg of Prednisone PO is 30.507 mg. Thus, the answer is 30.507 mg of Prednisone PO. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the conversion factor between Hydrocortisone and Prednisone. The conversion factor is that 1 mg of Prednisone is approximately equal to 5 mg of Hydrocortisone. 2. Use the conversion factor to convert the given dose of Hydrocortisone (152.535 mg) to the equivalent dose of Prednisone. 3. Perform the calculation: $\frac{152.535}{5} = 30.507$. Therefore, the equivalent dosage in mg of Prednisone PO for 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV is 30.507 mg. The final answer is 30.507.

The conversion factor between Prednisone and Hydrocortisone is important here. Typically, 1 mg of Prednisone is considered to be approximately equivalent to 3.5 to 4 mg of Hydrocortisone. Given that the patient has taken 45.802 mg of Prednisone PO, we will use the conversion factor of 4 mg of Hydrocortisone for every 1 mg of Prednisone for simplicity and common practice. So, the calculation is: \[ \text{Equivalent Hydrocortisone dosage (mg)} = 45.802 \, \text{mg of Prednisone} \times 4 \] Let's perform the calculation step by step. Step 1: Multiply the given dose of Prednisone by the conversion factor. \[ 45.802 \, \text{mg} \times 4 = 183.208 \, \text{mg of Hydrocortisone} \] Therefore, the equivalent dosage of 45.802 mg of Prednisone PO in mg of Hydrocortisone IV is approximately 183.208 mg. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the given dose of Prednisone: 45.802 mg. 2. Use the conversion factor between Prednisone and Hydrocortisone.

Here are the conversion factors we'll use: - Fentanyl patch: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 1.2 mg of oral morphine. A 60 mg Fentanyl patch delivers its dose over 72 hours. The 60 mg Fentanyl patch delivers \( \frac{60 \text{ mg}}{72 \text{ hours}} = \frac{60}{72} \approx 0.833 \text{ mg/hour} \). To convert this to MME, we use the conversion factor for Fentanyl: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approximately 1.2 mg of oral morphine. Since 1 mg/hour is 1000 mcg/hour, 0.833 mg/hour is \( 0.833 \times 1000 \text{ mcg/hour} \). Therefore, the MME for the 60 mg Fentanyl patch is \( 0.833 \times 1000 \times 1.2 / 1000 = 0.833 \times 1.2 \approx 1 \text{ mg/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 0.833 \times 1.2 \times 24 \). Let's calculate this step by step: For the 60 mg Fentanyl patch: \[ \text{Dose per hour} = \frac{60 \text{ mg}}{72 \text{ hours}} = \frac{60}{72} \approx 0.833 \text{ mg/hour}. \] Using the conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME (1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = 1.2 mg of oral morphine), we have: \[ 0.833 \text{ mg/hour} = 0.833 \times 1000 \text{ mcg/hour}. \] So the MME per hour is: \[ 0.833 \times 1000 \times 1.2 / 1000 = 0.833 \times 1.2 \approx 1 \text{ mg/hour}. \] To get the daily MME from the 60 mg Fentanyl patch: \[ \text{Daily MME from 60 mg Fentanyl patch} = 0.833 \times 1.2 \times 24 \approx 24 \text{ mg}. \] Next, let's calculate the MME for the Hydrocodone (HydroMORphone). The conversion factor for Hydrocodone to MME is that 1 mg of Hydrocodone is approximately equal to 2 mg of oral morphine. The patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day. Therefore, the total daily dose of Hydrocodone is: \[ 20 \text{ mg/dose} \times 3 \text{ doses/day} = 60 \text{ mg/day}. \] Using the conversion factor for Hydrocodone to MME: \[ \text{Daily MME from Hydrocodone} = 60 \text{ mg/day} \times 2 = 120 \text{ mg/day}. \] Now, let's calculate the MME for the Fentanyl buccal. The conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is that 1 mcg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 30-50 mcg of IV Fentanyl, and 100 mcg of IV Fentanyl is approximately equal to 10 mg of oral morphine. Therefore, 1 mcg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to \( \frac{10 \text{ mg}}{100} = 0.1 \text{ mg of oral morphine} \). Alternatively, a commonly used conversion factor is that 100 mcg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 10 mg of oral morphine, which simplifies to 1 mcg of Fentanyl buccal = 0.1 mg of oral morphine. However, another common approach is to use the conversion factor that 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 100 mg of oral morphine. Let's use the conversion factor that 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 100 mg of oral morphine. The patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day. Therefore, the total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is: \[ 30 \text{ mg/dose} \times 2 \text{ doses/day} = 60 \text{ mg/day}. \] Using the conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal to MME (1 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 100 mg of oral morphine): \[ \text{Daily MME from Fentanyl buccal} = 60 \text{ mg/day} \times 100 = 6000 \text{ mg/day}. \] It seems there might be an error in the conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal. Let's use an alternative approach. The conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is often given as 1 mcg of Fentanyl buccal = 10 mcg of IV Fentanyl. Since 100 mcg of IV Fentanyl is approximately equal to 10 mg of oral morphine, 1 mcg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to \( \frac{10 \text{ mg}}{10} = 1 \text{ mg of oral morphine}. \) So, 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 1000 mg of oral morphine. Let's use this approach: The patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day. Therefore, the total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is: \[ 30 \text{ mg/dose} \times 2 \text{ doses/day} = 60 \text{ mg/day}. \] Using the conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal to MME (1 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 100 mg of oral morphine): \[ \text{Daily MME from Fentanyl buccal} = 60 \text{ mg/day} \times 100 = 6000 \text{ mg/day}. \] It appears that the conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is quite high, and it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's use the conversion factor that 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal is approximately equal to 30 mg of oral morphine, which is a more commonly used conversion factor. Using this conversion factor: The total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is 60 mg/day. \[ \text{Daily MME from Fentanyl buccal} = 60 \text{ mg/day} \times 30 = 1800 \text{ mg/day}. \] Now, let's sum up all the MMEs from each medication: - MME from 60 mg Fentanyl patch: approximately 24 mg/day. - MME from 20 mg Hydrocodone 3 times a day: 120 mg/day. - MME from 30 mg Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day: 1800 mg/day. Adding these together gives us the total daily MME: \[ \text{Total MME} = 24 + 120 + 1800 = 1944 \text{ mg/day}. \] So the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 1944 mg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert the doses of Fentanyl (both the patch and buccal form) and Hydrocodone to their MME equivalents.\n\nFor the 60 mg Fentanyl patch:\n- The 60 mg Fentanyl patch delivers its dose over 72 hours. The dose per hour is \( \\frac{60 \\text{ mg}}{72 \\text{ hours}} = \\approx 0.833 \\text{ mg/hour} \\).\n- Using the conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME (1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = 1.2 mg of oral morphine), we convert 0.833 mg/hour to mcg/hour: \( 0.833 \\times 1000 \\approx 833 \\text{ mcg/hour} \\).\n- The MME per hour is therefore \( 833 \\text{ mcg/hour} \\times 1.2 \\approx 1000 \\text{ mg/hour} / 1000 = 1 \\text{ mg/hour} \\times 1.2 = 0.833 \\times 1.2 \\approx 1 \\text{ mg/hour} \\).\n- To get the daily MME from the 60 mg Fentanyl patch: \( 0.833 \\times 1.2 \\times 24 \\approx 24 \\text{ mg}. \\)\n\nFor the Hydrocodone (HydroMORphone):\n- The patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day.

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Age 65 years or older Let's go through the patient's information step-by-step to determine the score for each criterion. Step 1: Confusion The patient note does not mention any confusion or new mental status changes. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Step 2: Urea (BUN) > 7 mmol/L (or > 20 mg/dL) The patient's BUN is 21 mg/dL. Since 21 mg/dL is greater than 20 mg/dL, this criterion is met. Step 3: Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute The patient's respiratory rate (RR) is 19 breaths per minute. Since 19 is less than 30, this criterion is not met. Step 4: Blood pressure systolic ≤ 90 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg The patient's blood pressure (BP) is 121/79 mmHg. The systolic BP is 121 mmHg, which is greater than 90 mmHg, and the diastolic BP is 79 mmHg, which is greater than 60 mmHg. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Step 5: Age 65 years or older The patient is 41 years old. Since 41 is less than 65, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea (BUN) > 7 mmol/L (or > 20 mg/dL): Yes - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute: No - Blood pressure systolic ≤ 90 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 60 mmHg: No - Age 65 years or older: No Only one criterion (Urea > 20 mg/dL) is met.

He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.\nOn exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.\nChest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.\nHe underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.\nFollow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.\nHe was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CURB-65 score?", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '1', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to check the following criteria for the patient:\\n1.

Step 1: Convert HYDROMORPHONE to MME. - The conversion factor for HYDROMORPHONE (Hydrocodone) to MME is 2. The patient takes 10 mg of HYDROMORPHONE 1 time a day. - Therefore, the MME for HYDROMORPHONE is \(10 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 20 \, \text{MME}\). Step 2: Convert FENTANYL patch to MME. - The conversion factor for FENTANYL patch is as follows: a 25 mcg/hour patch is equivalent to approximately 25 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 600 mcg/day, which is 0.6 mg/day. The MME for a FENTANYL patch is approximately 300 times the patch strength in mcg/hour. For a 25 mcg/hour patch, the MME is approximately 25 * 300 / 24 = 31.25 MME/day. However, the patient's note says "40 mg of FENTANYL patch 3 times a day," which seems unusual because Fentanyl patches are typically prescribed in terms of their strength (e.g., 25 mcg/hour, 50 mcg/hour, etc.), not in milligrams. Since the notation "40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day" is not standard, I will assume that the "40 mg" refers to the total daily dose of Fentanyl in some form. Let's convert this to MME. If the patient is using a Fentanyl patch that delivers 40 mg over the course of 3 applications per day, this seems incorrect because Fentanyl patches are usually applied once every 72 hours (every 3 days). Let's assume that the "40 mg" might refer to the total daily dose of Fentanyl in some other form, such as transdermal patches with an equivalent strength. Let's use the conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME. The conversion factor is that 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is roughly equivalent to 9 mg of oral morphine per day. However, if we assume that the "40 mg" is the total daily dose of Fentanyl from the patches, we can use the conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME. The conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME is that 1 mg of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 300 mg of oral morphine. So, if the patient is taking 40 mg of Fentanyl per day (which seems very high and unusual), the MME would be: \[ 40 \, \text{mg Fentanyl} \times 300 = 12000 \, \text{MME}.\] But this seems extremely high and unrealistic. Let's try another approach. If the "40 mg" refers to the strength of the patch, it's likely a misinterpretation. Let's assume the patient is using a Fentanyl patch that delivers 40 mcg/hour. The MME for a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch is: \[ 40 \, \text{mcg/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times \left(\frac{1 \, \text{mg}}{1000 \, \text{mcg}}\right) \times 300 = 40 \times 24 / 1000 \times 300 = 40 \times 24 \times 0.3 = 288 \, \text{MME}.\] Since the patient is using the patch 3 times a day, this would mean the patient is using three patches simultaneously or changing patches very frequently, which is not typical. Let's assume the patient is using a single patch that delivers the equivalent of 40 mcg/hour and is changed every 72 hours. If the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch, the MME for one patch is approximately 288 MME for the duration it is applied. Since the patch is applied 3 times a day, this suggests an incorrect interpretation. Let's assume the patient is using a different formulation or a combination of patches. Let's try another approach: if the "40 mg" refers to the total daily dose of Fentanyl from the patches, and each patch delivers a certain amount of Fentanyl over 72 hours, we need more information. For simplicity, let's assume the "40 mg" is the total daily dose of Fentanyl from the patches. If the patient is taking 40 mg of Fentanyl per day, the MME would be: \[ 40 \, \text{mg Fentanyl} \times 300 = 12000 \, \text{MME}.\] This is still very high and unrealistic. Let's assume the patient is using a combination of patches that add up to a total daily dose equivalent to 40 mg of Fentanyl. Step 3: Convert TRAMADOL to MME. - The conversion factor for TRAMADOL to MME is approximately 0.1. The patient takes 60 mg of TRAMADOL 2 times a day, so the total daily dose of TRAMADOL is \(60 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{mg/day}\). - Therefore, the MME for TRAMADOL is \(120 \, \text{mg} \times 0.1 = 12 \, \text{MME}\). Now, let's sum up the MME from all medications: - HYDROMORPHONE: 20 MME - FENTANYL (assuming the 40 mg is the total daily dose): 12000 MME - TRAMADOL: 12 MME Adding these together: \[ 20 \, \text{MME (HYDROMORPHONE)} + 12000 \, \text{MME (FENTANYL)} + 12 \, \text{MME (TRAMADOL)} = 12032 \, \text{MME}.\] This result seems extremely high and unrealistic due to the assumption about the Fentanyl dose. Let's try another approach for the Fentanyl patch. If the "40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day" is a misinterpretation and it means the patient is using a Fentanyl patch with a certain strength applied 3 times a day, let's assume the patient is using a 25 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch. The MME for a 25 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch is approximately 31.25 MME/day. If the patient is using this patch 3 times a day, it suggests an incorrect interpretation because patches are not typically applied multiple times a day. Let's assume the patient is using a combination of patches that add up to a total daily dose. If the patient is using a 100 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch, the MME would be: \[ 100 \, \text{mcg/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times \left(\frac{1 \, \text{mg}}{1000 \, \text{mcg}}\right) \times 300 = 100 \times 24 / 1000 \times 300 = 100 \times 24 \times 0.3 = 720 \, \text{MME}.\] If the patient is using this patch 3 times a day, the total MME would be: \[ 720 \, \text{MME} \times 3 = 2160 \, \text{MME}.\] Now, let's sum up the MME from all medications with this new assumption: - HYDROMORPHONE: 20 MME - FENTANYL (assuming 100 mcg/hour patch used 3 times a day): 2160 MME - TRAMADOL: 12 MME Adding these together: \[ 20 + 2160 + 12 = 2192 \, \text{MME}.\] This is still very high. Let's try one more approach. If the "40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day" means the patient is using a patch that delivers 40 mcg/hour and is applied 3 times a day. The MME for a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch is: \[ 40 \, \text{mcg/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times \left(\frac{1 \, \text{mg}}{1000 \, \text{mcg}}\right) \times 300 = 40 \times 24 / 1000 \times 300 = 40 \times 24 \times 0.3 = 288 \, \text{MME}.\] If the patient is using this patch 3 times a day, the total MME would be: \[ 288 \, \text{MME} \times 3 = 864 \, \text{MME}.\] Now, let's sum up the MME from all medications with this new assumption: - HYDROMORPHONE: 20 MME - FENTANYL (assuming 40 mcg/hour patch used 3 times a day): 864 MME - TRAMADOL: 12 MME Adding these together: \[ 20 + 864 + 12 = 896 \, \text{MME}.\] This seems more reasonable. So the final MME is 896. Thus, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Convert HYDROMORPHONE to MME: \(10 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 20 \, \text{MME}\). 2. Convert FENTANYL to MME: Assuming the patient is using a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch applied 3 times a day, the MME for one patch is 288 MME, and for 3 patches, it is \(288 \times 3 = 864 \, \text{MME}\). 3. Convert TRAMADOL to MME: The total daily dose is \(60 \, \text{mg} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{mg}\), and the MME is \(120 \, \text{mg} \times 0.1 = 12 \, \text{MME}\). Adding them up: \(20 + 864 + 12 = 896 \, \text{MME}\). Therefore, the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 896. The final answer is 896. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) for the patient's medications, we need to convert each medication to its MME and then sum them up.\n\nStep 1: Convert HYDROMORPHONE to MME.\n- The conversion factor for HYDROMORPHONE to MME is 2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose.

From the patient note: - The patient is a 66-year-old male. - The patient's height is 168.0 cm. - The patient's weight is 68 kg. - The patient's serum creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. First, we need to calculate the patient's BMI to determine if the patient is overweight, obese, or within the normal range. The formula for BMI is: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{(height (m))^2}} \] The patient's height in meters is 1.68 m. So, \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{68}{(1.68)^2} = \frac{68}{2.8224} \approx 24.09. \] The BMI of 24.09 indicates that the patient is within the normal range (normal BMI range is typically between 18.5 and 24.9). Since the patient's BMI is within the normal range, we will use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. To calculate the ideal body weight (IBW), we use the formula for males: \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight (IBW)} = 50 + 0.9 \times (\text{Height in cm} - 152). \] The patient's height is 168 cm. So, \[ \text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \times (168 - 152) = 50 + 0.9 \times 16 = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 \, \text{kg}. \] Since the patient's actual weight is 68 kg and the ideal body weight is 64.4 kg, the adjusted body weight will be the minimum of these two values, which is 64.4 kg. Now we can use the Cockroft-Gault equation to calculate the creatinine clearance. The Cockroft-Gault equation for males is: \[ \text{Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)} = \frac{(140 - \text{Age}) \times \text{Weight (kg)} \times 1.23}{\text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)} \times 72}. \] However, since we are using the adjusted body weight (64.4 kg), the formula becomes: \[ \text{Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)} = \frac{(140 - \text{Age}) \times \text{Adjusted Weight (kg)} \times 1.23}{\text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)} \times 72}. \] Plugging in the values: - Age = 66 years. - Adjusted Weight = 64.4 kg. - Serum Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL. So the equation becomes: \[ \text{Creatinine Clearance} = \frac{(140 - 66) \times 64.4 \times 1.23}{5.09 \times 72}. \] Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Calculate \(140 - \text{Age}\). \[ 140 - 66 = 74. \] Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by the adjusted weight. \[ 74 \times 64.4 = 4763.6. \] Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by 1.23. \[ 4763.6 \times 1.23 = 5848.028. \] Step 4: Calculate the denominator, which is the serum creatinine times 72. \[ 5.09 \times 72 = 366.48. \] Step 5: Divide the result from Step 3 by the result from Step 4. \[ \text{Creatinine Clearance} = \frac{5848.028}{366.48} \approx 15.96. \] Rounding to one decimal place, the creatinine clearance is approximately 16.0 mL/min. So the final answer is 16.0 mL/min. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we need the following information: the patient's age, gender, weight, serum creatinine level, and the adjusted body weight based on BMI.

First, we calculate the patient's BMI: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{68}{(1.68)^2} = \frac{68}{2.8224} \approx 24.09. \] Since the BMI (24.09) is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), we use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. The formula for the ideal body weight (IBW) for males is: \[ \text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \times (\text{Height in cm} - 152). \] For a height of 168 cm, the IBW is: \[ \text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \times (168 - 152) = 50 + 0.9 \times 16 = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 \, \text{kg}. \] Since the actual weight is 68 kg and the ideal body weight is 64.4 kg, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of these two values, which is 64.4 kg.

For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': '346.12', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CCL) using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we use the formula CCL = CK4 * W, where CK4 is the creatinine clearance and W is the patient's weight in kilograms. The patient's creatinine level is 5.09 mg/dL, and their weight is 68 kg. The BMI is calculated as 68 / (1.68)^2 ≈ 24.09, indicating the patient is overweight. Therefore, the adjusted body weight is set to 68 kg. Applying the formula, CCL = 5.09 * 68 = 346.12 mL/min. The final answer is 346.12 mL/min.", 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '16.0', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we need the following information: the patient's age, gender, weight, serum creatinine level, and the adjusted body weight based on BMI. The patient is a 66-year-old male with a height of 168.0 cm and a weight of 68 kg. The serum creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. First, we calculate the patient's BMI: \\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{68}{(1.68)^2} = \\frac{68}{2.8224} \\approx 24.09. \\] Since the BMI (24.09) is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), we use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual weight as the adjusted body weight. The formula for the ideal body weight (IBW) for males is: \\[ \\text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \\times (\\text{Height in cm} - 152). \\] For a height of 168 cm, the IBW is: \\[ \\text{IBW} = 50 + 0.9 \\times (168 - 152) = 50 + 0.9 \\times 16 = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 \\, \\text{kg}. \\] Since the actual weight is 68 kg and the ideal body weight is 64.4 kg, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of these two values, which is 64.4 kg. Now we use the Cockroft-Gault equation for males: \\[ \\text{Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Adjusted Weight (kg)} \\times 1.23}{\\text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)} \\times 72}. \\] Plugging in the values: - Age = 66 years. - Adjusted Weight = 64.4 kg. - Serum Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL. The equation becomes: \\[ \\text{Creatinine Clearance} = \\frac{(140 - 66) \\times 64.4 \\times 1.23}{5.09 \\times 72}. \\] Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Calculate \\(140 - \\text{Age}\\). \\[ 140 - 66 = 74. \\] Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by the adjusted weight. \\[ 74 \\times 64.4 = 4763.6. \\] Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by 1.23. \\[ 4763.6 \\times 1.23 = 5848.028. \\] Step 4: Calculate the denominator, which is the serum creatinine times 72. \\[ 5.09 \\times 72 = 366.48. \\] Step 5: Divide the result from Step 3 by the result from Step 4. \\[ \\text{Creatinine Clearance} = \\frac{5848.028}{366.48} \\approx 15.96. \\] Rounding to one decimal place, the creatinine clearance is approximately 16.0 mL/min.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '12.949', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To approach this task, we'll use the Rautaharju formula for correcting the QT interval. The Rautaharju formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times (\text{HR} - 62) \] where: - \(\text{QT}\) is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - \(\text{HR}\) is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). From the patient note, we have: - The heart rate (\(\text{HR}\)) = 136 bpm. - The QT interval (\(\text{QT}\)) = 330 msec. Now, let's plug these values into the Rautaharju formula step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the given values. - \(\text{QT} = 330\) msec. - \(\text{HR} = 136\) bpm. Step 2: Substitute the values into the Rautaharju formula. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = 330 + 0.154 \times (136 - 62). \] Step 3: Calculate the term inside the parentheses. \[ 136 - 62 = 74. \] Step 4: Multiply this result by 0.154. \[ 0.154 \times 74 = 11.4 \text{ (approximately)}. \] Step 5: Add this result to the original QT interval. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Rautaharju} = 330 + 11.4 = 341.4. \] So, the corrected QT interval using the Rautaharju formula is approximately 341.4 msec. Thus, the final answer is 341.4 msec. The JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To approach this task, we'll use the Rautaharju formula for correcting the QT interval.

The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 05/20/2020. 2. The cycle length is 28 days, which is the standard cycle length used in Naegele's Rule. Naegele's Rule states that the estimated due date is calculated by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of the last menstrual period. A simplified method involves adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then adding 9 months to that date. Let's apply this step-by-step: Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP. The LMP is 05/20/2020. Adding 7 days to 05/20/2020 gives us 05/27/2020. Step 2: Add 9 months to the result from Step 1. Adding 9 months to 05/27/2020 means we move forward 9 months from May 27, 2020. If we add 9 months to May 27, 2020: - May + 9 months = February of the next year. So, 9 months after May 27, 2020 is February 27, 2021. Therefore, the estimated due date is February 27, 2021, or 02/27/2021. Thus, the estimated due date is 02/27/2021. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Take the LMP: 05/20/2020. 2. Add 7 days to 05/20/2020: 05/20/2020 + 7 days = 05/27/2020. 3. Add 9 months to 05/27/2020: 05/27/2020 + 9 months = 02/27/2021. So the estimated due date is 02/27/2021. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date (EDD) using Naegele's Rule, we follow these steps:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L).

From the given information, the initial laboratory results are as follows: - Corrected sodium ($[\text{Na}^+]$) = 133 mmol/L, - Glucose = 569 mg/dL, - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) = 25.9 mg/dL. Now, we will plug these values into the formula for serum osmolality. \[ \text{Serum Osmolality} = 2 \times [\text{Na}^+] + \frac{[\text{glucose}]}{18} + \frac{[\text{BUN}]}{2.8} \] Substitute the given values: \[ \text{Serum Osmolality} = 2 \times 133 + \frac{569}{18} + \frac{25.9}{2.8} \] Let's calculate each term step-by-step. 1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

Step 1: Evaluate the Eye Opening component. The note says, "Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light." However, the Glasgow Coma Scale for Eye Opening is based on the patient's response to stimuli for opening their eyes, not just the reaction of the pupils to light. From the information given, "Her eyes open upon painful stimulus." This corresponds to a score of 3 on the Eye Opening component of the GCS because the patient opens her eyes to pain. Step 2: Evaluate the Verbal Response component. The note states that "Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated." This indicates that the patient is making sounds but not coherent speech. According to the GCS, this corresponds to a score of 2 for the Verbal Response component, as "incomprehensible sounds" is the appropriate category. Step 3: Evaluate the Motor Response component. The note says, "A pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities." This indicates that the patient withdraws from a painful stimulus. According to the GCS, a withdrawal to pain corresponds to a score of 4 for the Motor Response component. Now, we add up the scores from each component: - Eye Opening: 3 - Verbal Response: 2 - Motor Response: 4 The total Glasgow Coma Score is \(3 + 2 + 4 = 9\).

The Framingham formula for correcting the QT interval is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left( \frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1 \right) \] where: - \(\text{QT}\) is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - \(\text{HR}\) is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). Given: - The patient's QT interval (\(\text{QT}\)) = 330 msec. - The patient's heart rate (\(\text{HR}\)) = 144 bpm. Let's plug these values into the Framingham formula step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}}\). \[ \frac{60}{144} = 0.4167 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\). \[ \frac{60}{144} - 1 = 0.4167 - 1 = -0.5833 \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right)\). \[ 0.154 \times (-0.5833) \approx -0.0898 \] Step 4: Now, use the Framingham formula to find the corrected QT interval (\(\text{QTc}_\text{F}\)): \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right) \] Plugging in the values we have: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = 330 + (-0.0898) \] \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = 330 - 0.0898 \approx 329.9102 \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}}\), which is \(\frac{60}{144} = 0.4167\). 2. Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\), which is \(0.4167 - 1 = -0.5833\). 3. Calculate \(0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right)\), which is \(0.154 \times (-0.5833) \approx -0.0898\). 4. Use the Framingham formula to find the corrected QT interval: \(\text{QTc}_\text{F} = 330 + (-0.0898) \approx 329.9102\), which rounds to approximately 330 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. The final answer is 330. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula, we use the formula: \[ \\text{QTc}_\\text{F} = \\text{QT} + 0.154 \\times \\left( \\frac{60}{\\text{HR}} - 1 \\right). \\] Given: - The patient's QT interval (\\( \\text{QT} \\)) = 330 msec. - The patient's heart rate (\\( \\text{HR} \\)) = 144 bpm.

Start with the last menstrual period (LMP), which is 04/09/2021. 2. The cycle length is given as 25 days. However, Naegele's Rule typically assumes a standard 28-day cycle unless otherwise specified. Since the cycle length is not 28 days, we'll need to adjust the calculation accordingly. Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle involves adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP month and then adding 9 months to the LMP date. But since the cycle length is 25 days, we will use the formula for an adjusted cycle length. The general formula to calculate the EDD for a non-standard cycle length is: \[ \text{EDD} = \text{LMP} + (\text{cycle length} \times \text{number of weeks in pregnancy}) - \text{cycle length} + \text{gestation period adjustment}.\] However, a simpler approach is to use the standard Naegele's Rule and then adjust for the cycle length difference. Let's first calculate the EDD assuming a 28-day cycle using Naegele's Rule: Step 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP month. The LMP is 04/09/2021. Adding 7 days to April 9 gives us April 16. Step 2: Add 9 months to this date. Adding 9 months to April 16, 2021, takes us to January 16, 2022. So, the estimated due date using the standard 28-day cycle is January 16, 2022. Now, we need to adjust this due date for the cycle length of 25 days instead of 28 days. The difference between the standard cycle length (28 days) and the patient's cycle length (25 days) is \(28 - 25 = 3\) days. Since the patient's cycle is shorter than the standard 28 days, the ovulation and conception would occur earlier within the cycle. Therefore, the pregnancy would be expected to be shorter by the difference in cycle length. To adjust the due date, we subtract this difference from the due date calculated using the standard cycle. So, we subtract 3 days from January 16, 2022. January 16, 2022 - 3 days = January 13, 2022. Thus, the adjusted estimated due date is January 13, 2022. Therefore, the patient's estimated due date is 01/13/2022. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Use Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle to get an initial due date. 2. Calculate the difference between the standard cycle length (28 days) and the patient's cycle length (25 days), which is 3 days. 3. Adjust the due date by subtracting this difference from the initial due date. So the final answer is 01/13/2022. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date (EDD) using Naegele's Rule and adjusting for the cycle length:\n\n1. Start with the LMP: 04/09/2021.\n2. Use Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle:\n - Add 7 days to the LMP: 04/09/2021 + 7 days = 04/16/2021.\n - Add 9 months to this date: 04/16/2021 + 9 months = 01/16/2022.\nSo the estimated due date using the standard 28-day cycle is January 16, 2022.\n\n3.

The patient has a few key pieces of information that we should consider. The patient is presenting with symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, decreased libido, and has a past medical history of obesity and diabetes. Additionally, the patient's laboratory values include a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, indicating anemia, and the serum sodium level is 139 mEq/L. To correct the sodium level, we need to know if the patient has any conditions that would require a correction to the sodium level. One common condition that requires a correction to the sodium level is hyperglycemia because high glucose levels can cause a falsely elevated sodium level due to the osmotic effect of glucose. The formula to correct the sodium level for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (1 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL above 100 mg/dL of glucose) The patient's glucose level is 129 mg/dL. To use the formula, we need to calculate how much the glucose level exceeds 100 mg/dL. Glucose level = 129 mg/dL Excess glucose = 129 mg/dL - 100 mg/dL = 29 mg/dL Now, we apply the correction formula: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (0.6 x (Glucose - 100)) Using the given values: Measured Sodium = 139 mEq/L Glucose = 129 mg/dL Plugging in the values: Corrected Sodium = 139 + (0.6 * (129 - 100)) Corrected Sodium = 139 + (0.6 * 29) Corrected Sodium = 139 + 17.4 Corrected Sodium = 156.4 mEq/L It seems like I made an error. The formula I used is incorrect. The correct formula to adjust sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (1.6 * (Glucose/100 - 1)) Let's use this correct formula. Measured Sodium = 139 mEq/L Glucose = 129 mg/dL Plugging in the values: Corrected Sodium = 139 + (1.6 * (129 / 100 - 1)) Corrected Sodium = 139 + (1.6 * (1.29 - 1)) Corrected Sodium = 139 + (1.6 * 0.29) Corrected Sodium = 139 + 0.464 Corrected Sodium ≈ 139.464 mEq/L Rounded to the nearest whole number, the corrected sodium is approximately 139 mEq/L. However, let's also consider if there's another factor that might require correction. The patient has anemia (hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL), which can also affect the sodium level. However, the correction for anemia is not as commonly used as the correction for hyperglycemia. Since the glucose level is not extremely high (129 mg/dL), the correction for hyperglycemia is relatively small (approximately 0.464 mEq/L), and the measured sodium level remains essentially unchanged. Therefore, the corrected sodium concentration is approximately the same as the measured sodium concentration, which is 139 mEq/L. So the final answer is 139 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we need to consider if the patient's sodium level needs to be adjusted due to hyperglycemia.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

From the patient note, we have the following values: - Sodium ($[\text{Na}^+]$) = 130 mmol/L, - Glucose = 83.9 mg/dL, - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) = 163.9 mg/dL. Now, let's plug these values into the formula step by step. 1. Calculate the contribution from sodium: \[ 2 \times [\text{Na}^+] = 2 \times 130 = 260 \, \text{mOsm/kg} \] 2. Calculate the contribution from glucose: \[ \frac{[\text{glucose}]}{18} = \frac{83.9}{18} \approx 4.66 \, \text{mOsm/kg} \] 3. Calculate the contribution from BUN: \[ \frac{[\text{BUN}]}{2.8} = \frac{163.9}{2.8} \approx 58.54 \, \text{mOsm/kg} \] Now, sum up all the contributions to get the serum osmolality: \[ \text{Serum Osmolality} = 260 + 4.66 + 58.54 \approx 323.2 \, \text{mOsm/kg} \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the serum osmolality is approximately 323 mOsm/kg. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1.

Calculate the contribution from sodium: $2 \times 130 = 260$ mOsm/kg. 4. Calculate the contribution from glucose: $\frac{83.9}{18} \approx 4.66$ mOsm/kg. 5. Calculate the contribution from BUN: $\frac{163.9}{2.8} \approx 58.54$ mOsm/kg. 6. Sum up all the contributions: $260 + 4.66 + 58.54 \approx 323.2$ mOsm/kg. 7.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Here's the list of comorbidities mentioned in the patient's note: 1. Hepatoblastoma (in remission) 2. Leukemia (managed with appropriate therapy) 3. Congestive heart failure 4. Type II diabetes mellitus (uncomplicated) 5. Dementia 6. Severe liver disease 7. Status post cerebral vascular accident (no significant residual deficits) 8. Connective tissue disease Now, let's assign points to each of these conditions based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index: 1. **Hepatoblastoma (in remission):** Cancer (Hepatoblastoma is a type of cancer). The Charlson Comorbidity Index assigns 6 points for metastatic solid tumor or lymphoma and 1 point for a malignancy other than lymphoma located in the digestive system, respiratory system, female genital organs, urinary tract, or hematologic malignancies. Since hepatoblastoma is a type of liver cancer, it would typically fall under the category of a malignancy other than lymphoma located in the digestive system. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 2. **Leukemia:** Leukemia is a type of hematologic malignancy. According to the Charlson Comorbidity Index, leukemia gets 1 point. 3. **Congestive Heart Failure:** Congestive heart failure is scored as 1 point in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 4. **Type II Diabetes Mellitus (uncomplicated):** Uncomplicated diabetes mellitus is not assigned any points in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 5. **Dementia:** Dementia is scored as 1 point in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 6. **Severe Liver Disease:** Severe liver disease is scored as 3 points in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 7. **Status Post Cerebral Vascular Accident (no significant residual deficits):** A history of cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) is scored as 1 point in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. 8. **Connective Tissue Disease:** Connective tissue disease is not explicitly listed in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Typically, it is not assigned points unless it leads to specific complications that are included in the index (such as renal failure or heart disease). Since no such complications are mentioned here, we will not assign any points for this condition. Now, let's sum up the points from the identified comorbidities: - Hepatoblastoma (malignancy): 2 points - Leukemia: 1 point - Congestive Heart Failure: 1 point - Dementia: 1 point - Severe Liver Disease: 3 points - Cerebrovascular Disease (status post cerebral vascular accident): 1 point Adding these points together: \[ 2 (Hepatoblastoma) + 1 (Leukemia) + 1 (Congestive Heart Failure) + 1 (Dementia) + 3 (Severe Liver Disease) + 1 (Cerebrovascular Disease) = 9 \] Therefore, the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), we need to identify the comorbidities mentioned in the patient's medical history and assign points to each according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index scoring system.\n\nHere's the list of comorbidities mentioned in the patient's note:\n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition. Here is the task: Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> </think> To calculate the patient's maintenance fluid requirement in mL/hr, we need to use the standard formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements based on the patient's weight. The formula typically used is a tiered approach: 1. For the first 10 kg of body weight, the fluid requirement is 100 mL/kg/day. 2. For the next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg), the fluid requirement is 50 mL/kg/day. 3. For any weight above 20 kg, the fluid requirement is 20 mL/kg/day. Let's calculate the total daily fluid requirement for the patient and then convert it to mL/hr. The patient's weight on admission is 30 kg. Step 1: Calculate the fluid requirement for the first 10 kg. For the first 10 kg: \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 100 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 1000 \, \text{mL/day}\). Step 2: Calculate the fluid requirement for the next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg). For the next 10 kg: \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 50 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 500 \, \text{mL/day}\). Step 3: Calculate the fluid requirement for the remaining weight (above 20 kg). The remaining weight is \(30 \, \text{kg} - 20 \, \text{kg} = 10 \, \text{kg}\). For this remaining 10 kg: \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 200 \, \text{mL/day}\). Now, sum up all the components to get the total daily fluid requirement: Total daily fluid requirement = \(1000 \, \text{mL/day} + 500 \, \text{mL/day} + 200 \, \text{mL/day} = 1700 \, \text{mL/day}\). To convert this daily fluid requirement into an hourly rate, we divide the total daily fluid requirement by 24 hours: Maintenance fluid in mL/hr = \(\frac{1700 \, \text{mL/day}}{24 \, \text{hours}} \approx 70.83 \, \text{mL/hr}\). Rounding to the nearest whole number, the maintenance fluid requirement is approximately 71 mL/hr. So, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the patient's weight: 30 kg. 2. Use the tiered formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements: - For the first 10 kg: \(100 \, \text{mL/kg/day}\). - For the next 10 kg: \(50 \, \text{mL/kg/day}\). - For any weight above 20 kg: \(20 \, \text{mL/kg/day}\). 3. Calculate the fluid requirement for each tier: - First 10 kg: \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 100 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 1000 \, \text{mL/day}\). - Next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg): \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 50 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 500 \, \text{mL/day}\). - Remaining weight (above 20 kg): \(10 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{mL/kg/day} = 200 \, \text{mL/day}\). 4. Sum up the fluid requirements from all tiers to get the total daily fluid requirement: - Total daily fluid requirement = \(1000 \, \text{mL/day} + 500 \, \text{mL/day} + 200 \, \text{mL/day} = 1700 \, \text{mL/day}\). 5. Convert the total daily fluid requirement to an hourly rate: - Maintenance fluid in mL/hr = \(\frac{1700 \, \text{mL/day}}{24 \, \text{hours}} \approx 70.83 \, \text{mL/hr}\), which rounds to approximately 71 mL/hr. Thus, the answer is 71 mL/hr.

T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.', 'Question': "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': '449544', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': 'No Explanation', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '71', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's maintenance fluid requirement in mL/hr, we use the standard formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements based on the patient's weight.

The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 03/24/2017. 2. The cycle length is 30 days, which is the standard cycle length used in Naegele's Rule if it's regular and 28 days. Since the cycle length is given as 30 days, we will use the standard Naegele's Rule for a 28-day cycle unless otherwise specified. Naegele's Rule states that the estimated due date (EDD) is calculated by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of the last menstrual period. A simplified method involves adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then adding 9 months to that date. Let's apply this step-by-step: Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP. The LMP is 03/24/2017. Adding 7 days to 03/24/2017 gives us 03/31/2017. Step 2: Add 9 months to the result from Step 1. Adding 9 months to 03/31/2017 means we move forward 9 months from March 31st. If we add 9 months to March, we get December. So, 9 months after March 31st is December 31st of the same year. Thus, the estimated due date is December 31, 2017. So the estimated due date is 12/31/2017. Now, let's confirm this calculation step-by-step: 1. LMP: 03/24/2017. 2. Add 7 days to 03/24/2017: 03/24 + 7 days = 03/31/2017. 3. Add 9 months to 03/31/2017. Adding 9 months to March takes us to December. Therefore, 9 months after March 31st is December 31st of the same year. Thus, the estimated due date is 12/31/2017. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we follow these steps: \n1.

He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

Step 1: Identify the LMP and cycle length. The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 10/11/2020. The cycle length is 29 days. Step 2: Understand that conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation. Ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs approximately 14 days after the LMP. Step 3: Calculate the date of ovulation. If the cycle length is 29 days, ovulation would occur approximately 14 days after the LMP. The LMP is October 11, 2020. To find the date 14 days after October 11, 2020, we add 14 days to October 11, 2020. Let's do the calculation: October 11, 2020 + 14 days. Adding 14 days to October 11, 2020: - October has 31 days. - From October 11 to October 31 is 31 - 11 = 20 days. - So, if we add 14 days to October 11: Since 14 days is less than the remaining days in October (which is 20 days), we can simply add 14 days within October. October 11 + 14 days: October 11 + 14 = October 25. So, the estimated date of ovulation, and thus the estimated date of conception, is October 25, 2020. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is October 25, 2020, which is written as 10/25/2020. The final answer is 10/25/2020. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated date of conception, we use the information that the patient's last menstrual period (LMP) was on 10/11/2020 and her cycle length is 29 days. Conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation, which usually happens about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation occurs approximately 14 days after the LMP. Therefore, we need to add 14 days to the LMP (October 11, 2020). Adding 14 days to October 11, 2020 gives us October 25, 2020. Thus, the estimated date of conception is October 25, 2020.", "answer": "10/25/2020"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

From the information given, the LDL cholesterol concentration is explicitly stated as 72 mg/dL. Therefore, the patient's LDL cholesterol concentration is 72 mg/dL. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Read through the patient note to find the section that contains laboratory examination results. 2. Identify the specific values for the different types of cholesterol and lipids. 3. Locate the value for LDL cholesterol within the laboratory results. The laboratory examination results state: "Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein."

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time.

Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).\nDischarged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.', 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': '6', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': "The delta gap is the difference between the patient's blood glucose and the target glucose level. The patient's blood glucose is 126 mg/dL, and the target glucose level for diabetes is typically 120-125 mg/dL. Therefore, the delta gap is 126 - 120 = 6 mg/dL, which converts to 6 mEq/L. The patient's anion gap is 20.8 mEq/L, but this is not relevant to the delta gap calculation. The answer is 6 mEq/L.", 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '4.6', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's delta gap, we need to find the difference between the initial anion gap and the anion gap on day two following admission. The initial anion gap is 20.8 mEq/L. The anion gap on day two following admission is 16.2 mEq/L. The delta gap is calculated as: Delta gap = Initial anion gap - Anion gap on day two. Therefore, Delta gap = 20.8 mEq/L - 16.2 mEq/L = 4.6 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

The HAS-BLED score is used to predict the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions. The HAS-BLED score includes the following components: - H (Hypertension): Controlled or uncontrolled hypertension. - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function): Abnormal renal or liver function. - S (Stroke): Prior stroke. - B (Bleeding): Prior bleeding or predisposition to bleeding. - L (Labile INR): Labile international normalized ratio (INR). - E (Elderly): Age > 65 years. - D (Drugs/Alcohol): Concomitant use of drugs or alcohol. Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension that is poorly controlled recently. This component scores 1 point. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function):** The patient has end-stage liver fibrosis (which indicates abnormal liver function). There is no mention of abnormal renal function. Since the liver function is abnormal, this component scores 1 point. 3. **S (Stroke):** There is no mention of a prior stroke in the patient's history. Therefore, this component scores 0 points. 4. **B (Bleeding):** The patient has a history of a major bleeding episode in the past. This component scores 1 point. 5. **L (Labile INR):** There is no information provided about the patient's INR stability. Since we don't have any information about labile INR, we will assume this component scores 0 points. 6. **E (Elderly):** The patient is 67 years old, which is over 65 years. This component scores 1 point. 7. **D (Drugs/Alcohol):** The patient admits to mild alcohol consumption (about three drinks per week). While this is not heavy alcohol consumption, the presence of any alcohol intake can contribute to the risk. Therefore, this component scores 1 point. Now, let's add up the points from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function): 1 point - S (Stroke): 0 points - B (Bleeding): 1 point - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Elderly): 1 point - D (Drugs/Alcohol): 1 point Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5 points.

A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment.

The Framingham formula for correcting the QT interval is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left( \frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1 \right) \] where: - \(\text{QT}\) is the measured QT interval in milliseconds (msec). - \(\text{HR}\) is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). Given: - The patient's QT interval (\(\text{QT}\)) = 330 msec. - The patient's heart rate (\(\text{HR}\)) = 81 bpm. Let's plug these values into the Framingham formula step-by-step. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}}\). \[ \frac{60}{\text{HR}} = \frac{60}{81} \approx 0.7407 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\). \[ \frac{60}{81} - 1 \approx 0.7407 - 1 = -0.2593 \] Step 3: Multiply this result by 0.154. \[ 0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{81} - 1\right) \approx 0.154 \times (-0.2593) \approx -0.0399 \] Step 4: Add this result to the measured QT interval. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{F} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times \left(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\right) \approx 330 + (-0.0399) \approx 330 - 0.0399 \approx 329.96 \] Rounding to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval is approximately 330 msec. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}}\), which is \(\frac{60}{81} \approx 0.7407\). 2. Compute \(\frac{60}{\text{HR}} - 1\), which gives us \(0.7407 - 1 = -0.2593\). 3. Multiply this result by 0.154: \(0.154 \times (-0.2593) \approx -0.0399\). 4. Add this result to the original QT interval: \(330 + (-0.0399) \approx 329.96\), which rounds to approximately 330 msec. Thus, the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is approximately 330 msec. The final answer is 330 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To approach this task, we'll use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

Let's break this down step-by-step: 1. **History (H):** - The patient presented with acute chest pain and palpitations at rest, along with an episode of syncope. - The symptoms appeared 1 hour after taking the second dose of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. - The patient has a history of taking propranolol for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. - He also has a history of smoking regularly (up to 20 cigarettes a day). - No prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, or sudden cardiac death in the family history. - No biochemical abnormalities, including normal magnesium and potassium levels. Given the acute onset of chest pain, palpitations, and syncope, especially after taking medications, this suggests a potentially serious cardiac event. The presence of syncope is particularly concerning. The History component is typically scored as follows: - High-risk features (e.g., typical angina, new-onset angina, or angina at rest): 2 points. - Intermediate-risk features (e.g., atypical chest pain): 1 point. - Low-risk features (e.g., non-chest pain): 0 points. In this case, the patient has acute chest pain and palpitations at rest, along with syncope, which are high-risk features. Therefore, the History score is 2 points. 2. **EKG (E):** - The ECG showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL. - Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. - On the 2nd day, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that degenerated to ventricular fibrillation. - After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets. - An upper rib ECG showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3, which was initially thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome but was later ruled out after an ajmaline challenge test. The EKG findings include ST-segment changes (depression and elevation), ventricular arrhythmias (bigeminy, R on T phenomenon, polymorphic VT, and ventricular fibrillation), and other abnormal patterns. The EKG component is scored as follows: - Positive ECG changes (e.g., ST elevation or new left bundle branch block): 2 points. - Non-specific ECG changes (e.g., T-wave inversion, ST depression): 1 point. - Normal ECG: 0 points. Given the presence of ST-segment changes and significant arrhythmias, the EKG is abnormal and indicates a high-risk situation. Therefore, the EKG score is 2 points. 3. **Age (A):** - The patient is 35 years old. The Age component is scored as follows: - Age < 45 years: 0 points. - Age 45-64 years: 1 point. - Age ≥ 65 years: 2 points. Since the patient is 35 years old, the Age score is 0 points. 4. **Risk Factors (R):** - The patient has a history of smoking regularly (up to 20 cigarettes a day). - No other specific risk factors for coronary artery disease are mentioned (such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or strong family history of coronary artery disease). The Risk Factors component is scored as follows: - Presence of 2 or more risk factors: 2 points. - Presence of 1 risk factor: 1 point. - No risk factors: 0 points. Since the patient has one risk factor (smoking), the Risk Factors score is 1 point. 5. **Troponin (T):** - The note does not mention any information about the troponin levels. If troponin levels are not elevated or not mentioned, the Troponin component is scored as follows: - Elevated troponin: 1 point. - Normal or not measured troponin: 0 points. Since there is no mention of elevated troponin levels, we assume the Troponin score is 0 points. Now, let's sum up the scores for each component: - History (H): 2 points - EKG (E): 2 points - Age (A): 0 points - Risk Factors (R): 1 point - Troponin (T): 0 points Total HEART score = 2 (H) + 2 (E) + 0 (A) + 1 (R) + 0 (T) = 5 points. Therefore, the patient's HEART score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components: History (H), EKG (E), Age (A), Risk Factors (R), and Troponin (T).\n\n1. **History (H):** The patient presented with acute chest pain, palpitations at rest, and syncope. These are high-risk features. Therefore, the History score is 2 points.\n\n2. **EKG (E):** The EKG showed ST-segment changes, ventricular arrhythmias, and other abnormal patterns. This indicates a high-risk situation. Therefore, the EKG score is 2 points.\n\n3. **Age (A):** The patient is 35 years old. Since the patient is under 45 years old, the Age score is 0 points.\n\n4. **Risk Factors (R):** The patient has one risk factor (smoking).

These are high-risk features. Therefore, the History score is 2 points.\\n\\n2. **EKG (E):** The EKG showed ST-segment changes, ventricular arrhythmias, and other abnormal patterns. This indicates a high-risk situation. Therefore, the EKG score is 2 points.\\n\\n3. **Age (A):** The patient is 35 years old. Since the patient is under 45 years old, the Age score is 0 points.\\n\\n4. **Risk Factors (R):** The patient has one risk factor (smoking). Therefore, the Risk Factors score is 1 point.\\n\\n5. **Troponin (T):** There is no mention of elevated troponin levels.

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

From the patient note, the height is 150 cm and the weight is 32 kg. The formula commonly used to calculate BSA is the Mosteller formula: \[ \text{BSA (m}^2\text{)} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{height (cm)} \times \text{weight (kg)}}{3600}} \] Let's plug in the values: Height = 150 cm Weight = 32 kg Using the Mosteller formula: \[ \text{BSA} = \sqrt{\frac{150 \times 32}{3600}} \] First, calculate the numerator: \[ 150 \times 32 = 4800 \] Now, divide this by 3600: \[ \frac{4800}{3600} = \frac{4800 \div 1200}{3600 \div 1200} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333 \] Then take the square root of the result: \[ \text{BSA} = \sqrt{1.3333} \approx 1.155 \] Rounded to two decimal places, the BSA is approximately 1.16 m². So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the height and weight from the patient note: Height = 150 cm, Weight = 32 kg. 2. Use the Mosteller formula for BSA calculation: \[ \text{BSA} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{height (cm)} \times \text{weight (kg)}}{3600}}. \] 3. Calculate the numerator: \(150 \times 32 = 4800\). 4. Divide the result by 3600: \(\frac{4800}{3600} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333\). 5. Take the square root of the result: \(\sqrt{1.3333} \approx 1.155\). 6. Round the result to two decimal places: approximately 1.16 m². Thus, the patient's body surface area is approximately 1.16 m². The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's body surface area (BSA), we use the Mosteller formula: BSA = sqrt((height (cm) * weight (kg)) / 3600).

We'll calculate the score for each system based on the given information. Step 1: Respiratory System (PaO₂/FiO₂ and PEEP or FiO₂ if PEEP is not given) The patient's PaO₂ is 76 mm Hg and FiO₂ is 54%. Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, we use the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio to calculate the score. PaO₂/FiO₂ = 76 / 0.54 ≈ 140.74 The SOFA Respiratory score is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: Score = 0 - 400 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300: Score = 1 - 300 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 200: Score = 2 - 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100: Score = 3 - PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100: Score = 4 Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 140.74, it falls into the range 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100. Therefore, the Respiratory score is 3. Step 2: Coagulation System (Platelet count) The patient's platelet count is 175,000/µL. The SOFA Coagulation score is based on the platelet count: - Platelets > 150,000: Score = 0 - 150,000 ≥ Platelets > 100,000: Score = 1 - 100,000 ≥ Platelets > 50,000: Score = 2 - 50,000 ≥ Platelets > 20,000: Score = 3 - Platelets ≤ 20,000: Score = 4 Since the platelet count is 175,000/µL, it falls into the range > 150,000. Therefore, the Coagulation score is 0. Step 3: Liver System (Bilirubin level) The patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL. The SOFA Liver score is based on the bilirubin level: - Bilirubin ≤ 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2 < Bilirubin ≤ 2: Score = 1 - 2 < Bilirubin ≤ 6: Score = 2 - 6 < Bilirubin ≤ 12: Score = 3 - Bilirubin > 12: Score = 4 Since the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls into the range 2 < Bilirubin ≤ 6. Therefore, the Liver score is 2. Step 4: Cardiovascular System (Vasopressor use and MAP) The patient is receiving multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. We also have the blood pressure information: systolic BP = 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP = 75 mm Hg. To calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP), we use the formula: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{\text{Systolic BP} + 2 \times \text{Diastolic BP}}{3} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{120 + 2 \times 75}{3} = \frac{120 + 150}{3} = \frac{270}{3} = 90 \, \text{mm Hg}. \] Now, we need to determine the SOFA Cardiovascular score based on the vasopressor use and MAP. The SOFA Cardiovascular score is determined as follows: - No vasopressors and MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg: Score = 0 - Vasopressors required to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg or norepinephrine dose < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: Score = 1 - Norepinephrine dose 0.1-0.49 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: Score = 2 - Norepinephrine dose 0.5-1.49 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: Score = 3 - Norepinephrine dose ≥ 1.5 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: Score = 4 Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors (norEPINEPHrine, EPINEPHrine, DOPamine, and DOBUTamine), we need to convert the doses to their norepinephrine equivalents. The conversion factors for vasopressors are approximately: - NorEPINEPHrine: 1 mcg/kg/min = 1 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - EPINEPHrine: 1 mcg/kg/min of EPINEPHrine ≈ 0.1 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - DOPamine: - < 5 mcg/kg/min ≈ 0 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - 5-10 mcg/kg/min ≈ 0.1 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - > 10 mcg/kg/min ≈ 0.2 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - DOBUTamine: Not typically considered a vasopressor for this purpose, but if it's contributing to blood pressure support, it can be considered minimal. Let's calculate the equivalent norEPINEPHrine dose for each vasopressor: - NorEPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min of EPINEPHrine ≈ 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine - DOPamine: 7 mcg/kg/min. Since 7 mcg/kg/min falls between 5 and 10 mcg/kg/min, it is approximately 0.1 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine. - DOBUTamine: 1 mcg/kg/min. DOBUTamine is generally not considered a strong vasopressor and is often not included in the calculation unless it has a significant effect on blood pressure. For simplicity, we will assume its contribution is minimal and negligible for this calculation. Now, sum up the equivalent norEPINEPHrine doses: \[ \text{Total norEPINEPHrine equivalent} = 0.1 \, (\text{from norEPINEPHrine}) + 0.01 \, (\text{from EPINEPHrine}) + 0.1 \, (\text{from DOPamine}) + 0 \, (\text{from DOBUTamine}) = 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.1 = 0.21 \, \text{mcg/kg/min}. \] Since the total norEPINEPHrine equivalent dose is 0.21 mcg/kg/min, we use this to determine the Cardiovascular score. According to the SOFA Cardiovascular scoring: - Norepinephrine dose 0.1-0.49 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: Score = 2 Since 0.21 mcg/kg/min falls within the range 0.1-0.49 mcg/kg/min, the Cardiovascular score is 2. Step 5: CNS System (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) The patient's GCS score is 10. The SOFA CNS score is based on the GCS: - GCS 15: Score = 0 - 14 ≥ GCS ≥ 13: Score = 1 - 12 ≥ GCS ≥ 9: Score = 2 - 8 ≥ GCS ≥ 6: Score = 3 - GCS ≤ 5: Score = 4 Since the GCS score is 10, it falls into the range 12 ≥ GCS ≥ 9. Therefore, the CNS score is 2. Step 6: Renal System (Creatinine level or Urine output) The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and the urine output over the past 24 hours is 850 mL/day. We need to calculate the score based on both creatinine and urine output and take the higher score. For Creatinine: - Creatinine ≤ 1.2: Score = 0 - 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9: Score = 1 - 1.9 < Creatinine ≤ 3.4: Score = 2 - 3.4 < Creatinine ≤ 4.9: Score = 3 - Creatinine > 4.9: Score = 4 Since the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9. Therefore, the Renal score based on creatinine is 1. For Urine output: - Urine output > 2000 mL/day: Score = 0 - 2000 ≥ Urine output > 500 mL/day: Score = 1 - 500 ≥ Urine output > 200 mL/day: Score = 2 - 200 ≥ Urine output > 0 mL/day: Score = 3 - Urine output = 0 mL/day (anuria): Score = 4 Since the urine output is 850 mL/day, it falls into the range 2000 ≥ Urine output > 500 mL/day. Therefore, the Renal score based on urine output is 1. Since both the creatinine-based score and the urine output-based score are 1, the Renal score is 1. Now, we sum up the scores from all the systems: - Respiratory: 3 - Coagulation: 0 - Liver: 2 - Cardiovascular: 2 - CNS: 2 - Renal: 1 Total SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the patient's SOFA score is 10. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, CNS, and Renal. Here's the step-by-step calculation for each system:\n\nStep 1: Respiratory System\nThe patient's PaO₂ is 76 mm Hg and FiO₂ is 54%. The PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is 76 / 0.54 ≈ 140.74. According to the SOFA Respiratory scoring:\n- PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: Score = 0\n- 400 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300: Score = 1\n- 300 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 200: Score = 2\n- 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100: Score = 3\n- PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100: Score = 4\nSince the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 140.74, it falls into the range 200 ≥ PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100. Therefore, the Respiratory score is 3.\n\nStep 2: Coagulation System\nThe patient's platelet count is 175,000/µL. According to the SOFA Coagulation scoring:\n- Platelets > 150,000: Score = 0\n- 150,000 ≥ Platelets > 100,000: Score = 1\n- 100,000 ≥ Platelets > 50,000: Score = 2\n- 50,000 ≥ Platelets > 20,000: Score = 3\n- Platelets ≤ 20,000: Score = 4\nSince the platelet count is 175,000/µL, it falls into the range > 150,000. Therefore, the Coagulation score is 0.\n\nStep 3: Liver System\nThe patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL. According to the SOFA Liver scoring:\n- Bilirubin ≤ 1.2: Score = 0\n- 1.2 < Bilirubin ≤ 2: Score = 1\n- 2 < Bilirubin ≤ 6: Score = 2\n- 6 < Bilirubin ≤ 12: Score = 3\n- Bilirubin > 12: Score = 4\nSince the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls into the range 2 < Bilirubin ≤ 6.

The MAP is calculated as follows: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{120 + 2 \times 75}{3} = 90 \, \text{mm Hg}. \]\nTo determine the SOFA Cardiovascular score, we convert the doses to their norepinephrine equivalents:\n- NorEPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min\n- EPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min ≈ 0.01 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine\n- DOPamine: 7 mcg/kg/min ≈ 0.1 mcg/kg/min of norEPINEPHrine (since it falls between 5 and 10 mcg/kg/min)\n- DOBUTamine: negligible contribution.\nSumming up the equivalent norEPINEPHrine doses: \[0.1 + 0.01 + 0.1 = 0.21 \, \text{mcg/kg/min}.\] According to the SOFA Cardiovascular scoring:\n- Norepinephrine dose 0.1-0.49 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: Score = 2\nSince 0.21 mcg/kg/min falls within the range 0.1-0.49 mcg/kg/min, the Cardiovascular score is 2.\n\nStep 5: CNS System\nThe patient's GCS score is 10. According to the SOFA CNS scoring:\n- GCS 15: Score = 0\n- 14 ≥ GCS ≥ 13: Score = 1\n- 12 ≥ GCS ≥ 9: Score = 2\n- 8 ≥ GCS ≥ 6: Score = 3\n- GCS ≤ 5: Score = 4\nSince the GCS score is 10, it falls into the range 12 ≥ GCS ≥ 9. Therefore, the CNS score is 2.\n\nStep 6: Renal System\nThe patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and the urine output over the past 24 hours is 850 mL/day.\nFor Creatinine:\n- Creatinine ≤ 1.2: Score = 0\n- 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9: Score = 1\n- 1.9 < Creatinine ≤ 3.4: Score = 2\n- 3.4 < Creatinine ≤ 4.9: Score = 3\n- Creatinine > 4.9: Score = 4\nSince the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls into the range 1.2 < Creatinine ≤ 1.9. Therefore, the Renal score based on creatinine is 1.\nFor Urine output:\n- Urine output > 2000 mL/day: Score = 0\n- 2000 ≥ Urine output > 500 mL/day: Score = 1\n- 500 ≥ Urine output > 200 mL/day: Score = 2\n- 200 ≥ Urine output > 0 mL/day: Score = 3\n- Urine output = 0 mL/day (anuria): Score = 4\nSince the urine output is 850 mL/day, it falls into the range 2000 ≥ Urine output > 500 mL/day. Therefore, the Renal score based on urine output is 1.\nSince both the creatinine-based score and the urine output-based score are 1, the Renal score is 1.\n\nNow, we sum up the scores from all the systems:\n- Respiratory: 3\n- Coagulation: 0\n- Liver: 2\n- Cardiovascular: 2\n- CNS: 2\n- Renal: 1\nTotal SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10.\nTherefore, the patient's SOFA score is 10.", "answer": "10"}

Total Bilirubin 2. Serum Albumin 3. INR (Prothrombin Time) 4. Presence of Ascites 5. Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy The Child-Pugh Score categorizes liver function into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E), with each parameter being assigned points. Here are the scoring criteria for each parameter: - **Total Bilirubin:** - < 2 mg/dL: 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL: 2 points - 3-6 mg/dL: 3 points - > 6 mg/dL: 4 points - **Serum Albumin:** - > 3.5 g/dL: 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL: 2 points - 2.1-2.8 g/dL: 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL: 4 points - **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - < 1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - > 3.0: 4 points - **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Controlled with medication: 2 points - Refractory: 3 points - **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Controlled with medication: 2 points - Refractory: 3 points Now let's evaluate each parameter for the given patient: 1. **Total Bilirubin:** The patient's total bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL. - According to the criteria, if the total bilirubin is < 2 mg/dL, it gets 1 point. - Since the total bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL, it falls into the range of 2-3 mg/dL. - Therefore, it gets 2 points. 2. **Serum Albumin:** The patient's serum albumin is 3.2 g/dL. - According to the criteria, if the serum albumin is between 2.8-3.5 g/dL, it gets 2 points. - Since 3.2 g/dL falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, it gets 2 points. 3. **INR:** The patient's INR is 1.9. - According to the criteria, if the INR is between 1.7-2.3, it gets 2 points. - Since 1.9 falls within the range of 1.7-2.3, it gets 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** The patient note states "There was no evidence of ascites." - Therefore, the score for ascites is 1 point (none). 5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient has slight mental slowness and mild asterixis. These can be signs of hepatic encephalopathy. - However, the note does not specify whether the hepatic encephalopathy is controlled or refractory. Since the patient is described as having "slight mental slowness and mild asterixis," it suggests that the condition is present but not severe or refractory. - We will assume that the hepatic encephalopathy is controlled with medication since it is not described as refractory. - Therefore, the score for hepatic encephalopathy is 2 points (controlled with medication). Now we sum up the points for each parameter: - Total Bilirubin: 2 points - Serum Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Hepatic Encephalopathy: 2 points Adding these points together: \[ 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 \] The Child-Pugh Score is 9. To determine the Child-Pugh class, we use the following classification: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. However, the question asks for the Child-Pugh Score, which is the numerical score. So the Child-Pugh Score is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: Total Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, INR, Presence of Ascites, and Presence of Hepatic Encephalopathy.

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

Here, the systolic pressure is 125 mmHg and the diastolic pressure is 75 mmHg. Now, we plug these values into the formula for MAP: \[ \text{MAP} = \frac{2 \times 75 + 125}{3} \] Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Calculate \(2 \times \text{Diastolic Pressure}\): \[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \] Step 2: Add the systolic pressure to this result: \[ 150 + 125 = 275 \] Step 3: Divide the result by 3: \[ \frac{275}{3} \approx 91.67 \] So, the mean arterial pressure is approximately 91.67 mmHg. Therefore, the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the systolic and diastolic pressures from the given blood pressure (BP): Systolic = 125 mmHg, Diastolic = 75 mmHg. 2. Use the formula for mean arterial pressure: \(\text{MAP} = \frac{2 \times \text{Diastolic Pressure} + \text{Systolic Pressure}}{3}\). 3. Substitute the values into the formula: \(\text{MAP} = \frac{2 \times 75 + 125}{3}\). 4. Perform the multiplication: \(2 \times 75 = 150\). 5. Add the systolic pressure to the result: \(150 + 125 = 275\). 6. Divide the sum by 3: \(\frac{275}{3} \approx 91.67\). Thus, the mean arterial pressure is approximately 91.67 mmHg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

The patient is 172 cm tall and weighs 100 kg. One common formula to calculate BSA is the Mosteller formula: \[ \text{BSA (m}^2\text{)} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{height (cm)} \times \text{weight (kg)}}{3600}} \] Let's plug in the given values: Height = 172 cm Weight = 100 kg Using the Mosteller formula: \[ \text{BSA} = \sqrt{\frac{172 \times 100}{3600}} \] First, calculate the numerator: \[ 172 \times 100 = 17200 \] Now, divide this by 3600: \[ \frac{17200}{3600} \approx 4.7778 \] Then take the square root of the result: \[ \text{BSA} = \sqrt{4.7778} \approx 2.186 \] Rounded to two decimal places, the BSA is approximately 2.19 m². So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the formula for calculating BSA: The Mosteller formula, which is \(\text{BSA} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{height (cm)} \times \text{weight (kg)}}{3600}}\). 2. Plug in the given values: height = 172 cm and weight = 100 kg. 3. Calculate the numerator: \(172 \times 100 = 17200\). 4. Divide the result by 3600: \(\frac{17200}{3600} \approx 4.7778\). 5. Take the square root of the result: \(\sqrt{4.7778} \approx 2.186\). 6. Round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places, which gives approximately 2.19 m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

The Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism includes the following factors: 1. Clinical signs suggestive of DVT (DVT = deep vein thrombosis) 2. Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE 3. Heart rate > 100 bpm 4. Immobilization for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks 5. Previous DVT or PE 6. Hemoptysis 7. Cancer Let's evaluate the given patient note against these criteria: 1. **Clinical signs suggestive of DVT**: The patient note mentions that the patient was asymptomatic and was admitted after a routine chest x-ray showed a mediastinal mass. There is no mention of any clinical signs suggestive of DVT such as leg swelling, pain, or tenderness. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE**: The patient has a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region and a type B dissection originating from an aneurysm of the left cervical arch. The primary diagnosis here is aortic dissection and aneurysm, not pulmonary embolism. Therefore, an alternative diagnosis (aortic dissection) is more likely than PE. This criterion is not met. 3. **Heart rate > 100 bpm**: The patient note mentions that the resting pulse was under 60 beats per minute. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 4. **Immobilization for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks**: There is no mention of recent immobilization or surgery within the last 4 weeks in the patient note. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 5. **Previous DVT or PE**: The patient note does not mention any history of previous DVT or PE. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 6. **Hemoptysis**: The patient note does not mention any hemoptysis. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 7. **Cancer**: The patient note does not mention any history of cancer. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Now let's assign the points for each criterion that is met: - Clinical signs suggestive of DVT: 1.5 points (not met, so 0 points) - Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: 3 points (not met, so 0 points) - Heart rate > 100 bpm: 1.5 points (not met, so 0 points) - Immobilization for > 3 days or surgery within the last 4 weeks: 1.5 points (not met, so 0 points) - Previous DVT or PE: 1 point (not met, so 0 points) - Hemoptysis: 1 point (not met, so 0 points) - Cancer: 1 point (not met, so 0 points) Adding up the points, the total score is 0.

Total Bilirubin 2. Serum Albumin 3. Prothrombin Time (INR can be used as a proxy for this) 4. Presence of Ascites 5. Presence and Severity of Hepatic Encephalopathy The Child-Pugh Score system assigns points to each of these parameters and then sums them up to categorize the patient's liver function. Let's evaluate each parameter step-by-step: 1. **Total Bilirubin:** - The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3-6 mg/dL = 3 points - > 6 mg/dL = 4 points - Since the total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL, it falls into the range of 2-3 mg/dL. - Therefore, the score for Total Bilirubin is 2 points. 2. **Serum Albumin:** - The patient's albumin level is 2.8 g/dL. - According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - 2.1-2.8 g/dL = 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL = 4 points - Since the albumin level is 2.8 g/dL, it falls into the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL. - Therefore, the score for Serum Albumin is 2 points. 3. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** - The patient's INR is 1.9. - According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - 2.4-3.0 = 3 points - > 3.0 = 4 points - Since the INR is 1.9, it falls into the range of 1.7-2.3. - Therefore, the score for Prothrombin Time (INR) is 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - The patient has moderate ascites. - According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria: - None = 1 point - Mild = 2 points - Moderate = 3 points - Tense ascites or refractory ascites = 4 points - Since the patient has moderate ascites, the score for Ascites is 3 points. 5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** - The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. - According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria: - None = 1 point - Grade 1 = 1 point - Grade 2 = 2 points - Grade 3 = 3 points - Grade 4 = 4 points - Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy is typically mild confusion and Grade 2 involves more severe confusion but not coma. - Since the patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy, we will take the higher score within this range to be conservative. Let's assume it is Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy. - Therefore, the score for Hepatic Encephalopathy is 2 points. Now, let's sum up the scores for each parameter: - Total Bilirubin: 2 points - Serum Albumin: 2 points - Prothrombin Time (INR): 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Hepatic Encephalopathy: 2 points Adding these together: \(2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11\). To determine the Child-Pugh Class, we use the total score: - A total score of 5-6 corresponds to Class A. - A total score of 7-9 corresponds to Class B. - A total score of 10-15 corresponds to Class C. Since the total score is 11, the patient falls into Class C. The Child-Pugh Score is the sum of the points, which is 11. So the Child-Pugh Class is C, and the total score is 11. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: Total Bilirubin, Serum Albumin, Prothrombin Time (INR), Presence of Ascites, and Presence and Severity of Hepatic Encephalopathy.\n\n1. **Total Bilirubin:** The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh Score criteria, 2-3 mg/dL corresponds to 2 points. Therefore, the score for Total Bilirubin is 2 points.\n\n2. **Serum Albumin:** The patient's albumin level is 2.8 g/dL. According to the criteria, 2.8-3.5 g/dL corresponds to 2 points. Therefore, the score for Serum Albumin is 2 points.\n\n3. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** The patient's INR is 1.9. According to the criteria, 1.7-2.3 corresponds to 2 points. Therefore, the score for Prothrombin Time (INR) is 2 points.\n\n4. **Ascites:** The patient has moderate ascites.

The Framingham Risk Score estimates the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The variables needed for the calculation include age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. Here are the patient's details: - Age: 67 years old - Total cholesterol: 196 mg/dL - HDL cholesterol: 50 mg/dL - Systolic blood pressure: 140 mm Hg - Hypertension treatment: Yes (taking lisinopril and metoprolol) - Smoking status: No (she does not smoke) - BMI: 33 kg/m2 (though BMI is not directly used in the Framingham Risk Score calculation) The Framingham Risk Score for women is calculated using the following points system for each variable: 1. Age 2. Total cholesterol 3. HDL cholesterol 4. Systolic blood pressure 5. Treatment for hypertension 6. Smoking status Let's calculate the points for each variable step-by-step. ### Step 1: Calculate points for Age The patient is 67 years old. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women: - Age 65-69: 9 points So, the points for age = 9. ### Step 2: Calculate points for Total Cholesterol The patient's total cholesterol is 196 mg/dL. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women: - Total cholesterol 190-199 mg/dL: 4 points So, the points for total cholesterol = 4. ### Step 3: Calculate points for HDL Cholesterol The patient's HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women: - HDL cholesterol 50-59 mg/dL: -1 point So, the points for HDL cholesterol = -1. ### Step 4: Calculate points for Systolic Blood Pressure The patient's systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg, and she is on treatment for hypertension (taking lisinopril and metoprolol). We need to use the systolic blood pressure points for treated hypertension. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women under treated hypertension: - Systolic BP 140-149 mm Hg: 3 points So, the points for systolic blood pressure = 3. ### Step 5: Calculate points for Treatment for Hypertension Since the patient is on treatment for hypertension (taking lisinopril and metoprolol), we add points for being on treatment for hypertension. From the Framingham Risk Score tables: - Treatment for hypertension: +1 point So, the points for treatment for hypertension = 1. ### Step 6: Calculate points for Smoking Status The patient does not smoke. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women: - Non-smoker: 0 points So, the points for smoking status = 0. Now, let's sum up all the points: Points for age = 9 Points for total cholesterol = 4 Points for HDL cholesterol = -1 Points for systolic blood pressure = 3 Points for treatment for hypertension = 1 Points for smoking status = 0 Total points = 9 + 4 - 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 16 Now, we need to convert these total points into a 10-year risk of CHD using the Framingham Risk Score table for women. From the Framingham Risk Score tables for women, a total score of 16 corresponds to a 10-year risk of CHD. For a total score of 16, the 10-year risk of CHD is approximately 10%. So, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is 16, corresponding to a 10-year risk of approximately 10%.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score includes the following factors: - H (Hypertension: systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg) - A (Abnormal Renal Function) - S (Abnormal Liver Function) - B (Bleeding history or predisposition) - L (Labile INR) - E (Elderly: age > 65 years) - D (Drugs: concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as NSAIDs or alcohol) Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H (Hypertension):** The patient has a blood pressure of 164/113 mmHg. Since the diastolic BP is > 100 mmHg, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **A (Abnormal Renal Function):** The note states that there are no signs of renal impairment, and creatinine levels and GFR are normal. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 3. **S (Abnormal Liver Function):** There is no mention of abnormal liver function in the patient note. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 4. **B (Bleeding history or predisposition):** The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 5. **L (Labile INR):** The note mentions that the INR has consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 6. **E (Elderly: age > 65 years):** The patient is 70 years old, which is greater than 65 years. Therefore, this criterion is met.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

The formula for the anion gap is: \[ \text{Anion Gap (AG)} = \text{Sodium (Na)} - (\text{Chloride (Cl)} + \text{Bicarbonate (HCO3)}) \] The albumin-corrected anion gap is calculated using the formula: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = \text{AG} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Measured Albumin}) \] where the normal albumin level is typically 4 g/dL. From the patient note, we have the following laboratory values: - Sodium (Na): 135 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl): 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3): 18 mmol/L - Albumin: 1.2 g/dL Let's calculate the anion gap first: \[ \text{AG} = \text{Na} - (\text{Cl} + \text{HCO3}) = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, we will use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap. The normal albumin level is 4 g/dL, and the measured albumin level is 1.2 g/dL. \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = \text{AG} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Measured Albumin}) \] \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.2) \] \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 7 + 2.5 \times 2.8 \] \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 7 + 7 \] \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 14 \, \text{mEq/L} \] So, the patient's albumin-corrected anion gap is 14 mEq/L. The step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Calculate the anion gap using the formula: \[ \text{AG} = \text{Na} - (\text{Cl} + \text{HCO3}) \] - Sodium (Na) = 135 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 18 mmol/L - Therefore, \[ \text{AG} = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] 2. Use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = \text{AG} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Measured Albumin}) \] - Normal Albumin = 4 g/dL - Measured Albumin = 1.2 g/dL - Therefore, \[ \text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.2) \] - Simplify inside the parenthesis: \[ 4 - 1.2 = 2.8 \] - Now multiply by 2.5: \[ 2.5 \times 2.8 = 7 \] - Add this result to the anion gap: \[ 7 + 7 = 14 \] Thus, the albumin-corrected anion gap is 14 mEq/L. The final answer is 14 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap, we first need the anion gap (AG), which is calculated as: \n\[ \\text{AG} = \\text{Sodium (Na)} - (\\text{Chloride (Cl)} + \\text{Bicarbonate (HCO3)}) \\]\nFrom the given values:\n- Sodium (Na) = 135 mmol/L\n- Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L\n- Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 18 mmol/L\nSo, the anion gap is:\n\[ \\text{AG} = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 \\, \\text{mEq/L}.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap:\n\[ \\text{Albumin-corrected AG} = \\text{AG} + 2.5 \\times (\\text{Normal Albumin} - \\text{Measured Albumin}) \\]\nwhere the normal albumin level is 4 g/dL and the measured albumin level is 1.2 g/dL.\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n\[ \\text{Albumin-corrected AG} = 7 + 2.5 \\times (4 - 1.2) \\]\nCalculate the difference between the normal and measured albumin levels:\n\[ 4 - 1.2 = 2.8 \\]\nNow multiply this difference by 2.5:\n\[ 2.5 \\times 2.8 = 7. \\]\nAdd this result to the anion gap:\n\[ 7 + 7 = 14. \\]\nTherefore, the albumin-corrected anion gap is 14 mEq/L.", "answer": "14"}

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B', 'LLM Answer': '0.3', 'LLM Raw Thinking': ' ', 'LLM Explanation': "The albumin corrected delta gap (ACDG) is calculated to assess the effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

Step 1: Identify the LMP and cycle length. The LMP is 08/22/2014. The cycle length is 27 days. Step 2: Understand that conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation. Ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. For a cycle of 27 days, ovulation would occur approximately 27 - 14 = 13 days after the LMP. So, we need to calculate the date that is 13 days after the LMP (08/22/2014). Step 3: Add 13 days to the LMP (08/22/2014). Let's do the calculation step by step: - The LMP is August 22, 2014. - Adding 13 days to August 22, 2014. August has 31 days. If we add 13 days to August 22, 2014: August 22 + 13 days. Let's break this down: - From August 22 to August 31: There are 31 - 22 = 9 days left in August. - After using up these 9 days within August, we have 13 - 9 = 4 days remaining to add. So, after August 31, we move into September. Adding the remaining 4 days to September gives us September 4. Therefore, 13 days after August 22, 2014, is September 4, 2014. Thus, the estimated date of conception is September 4, 2014, or 09/04/2014. The final answer is 09/04/2014.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's HEART score?

The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain can be associated with various conditions, including pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, or other non-cardiac causes. Since the patient has a history of altered mental status due to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and was found to be COVID positive, there could be multiple factors contributing to his symptoms. However, for the HEART score, we need to focus on the characteristics of the chest pain and its association with cardiac events. The patient's chest pain is described as pleuritic, which is typically sharp and worsens with deep breaths or coughing. This type of pain is often associated with pericarditis or pulmonary conditions rather than typical angina. **Score for History (H):** - Typical angina: 0 points - Atypical chest pain: 1 point - Non-cardiac chest pain: 2 points Since the chest pain is described as pleuritic, it is likely to be atypical or non-cardiac. Given the context, we will assign it the highest score for non-specific chest pain. Let's assign a score of 2 for the History component. ### Step 2: Evaluate the ECG (E) The ECG findings are mentioned as showing normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. **Score for ECG (E):** - Normal ECG: 0 points - Non-diagnostic ECG changes: 1 point - Ischemic changes: 2 points Since the ECG shows low voltages in the limb leads but no diffuse ST-segment elevations or other ischemic changes, it is not entirely normal but also not indicative of ischemia. We will assign a score of 1 for the ECG component. ### Step 3: Evaluate the Age (A) The patient is 47 years old. **Score for Age (A):** - < 45 years: 0 points - 45-64 years: 1 point - > 64 years: 2 points Since the patient is 47 years old, he falls into the 45-64 years category. So, the score for Age (A) is 1. ### Step 4: Evaluate the Risk Factors (R) The patient's medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease. **Score for Risk Factors (R):** - No risk factors: 0 points - One or more risk factors: 1 point Since the patient has two risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension), he has one or more risk factors. So, the score for Risk Factors (R) is 1. ### Step 5: Evaluate the Troponin (T) The initial troponin level was 0.481 ng/ml, which is elevated (reference <0.012 ng/ml), but it subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml. **Score for Troponin (T):** - Normal: 0 points - Elevated: 1 point Since the initial troponin was elevated (0.481 ng/ml), even though it later normalized, the score for Troponin (T) is 1. Now, let's sum up all the scores: - History (H): 2 - ECG (E): 1 - Age (A): 1 - Risk Factors (R): 1 - Troponin (T): 1 Total HEART score = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. The HEART score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). So, the patient's HEART score is 6. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components: History (H), ECG (E), Age (A), Risk Factors (R), and Troponin (T).\n\n1. **History (H):** The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is typically sharp and worsens with deep breaths or coughing, suggesting it might be atypical or non-cardiac. Therefore, we assign a score of 2 for the History component.\n\n2. **ECG (E):** The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. Since it is not entirely normal but also not indicative of ischemia, we assign a score of 1 for the ECG component.\n\n3. **Age (A):** The patient is 47 years old, which falls into the 45-64 years category.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between 10/01/2022 and 06/13/2023. Let's break this down month by month and year by year. From 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is exactly one year. - From 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is 365 days because 2022 is not a leap year. Now, we need to calculate the number of days from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023. Let's count the days month by month from October 1, 2023 to June 13, 2023. - October 2022: From October 1 to October 31 is 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days. But since we're starting from October 1, 2022 and going to the end of October 2022, it's actually the full month of October minus the days already counted from the start date. Since we're moving forward in time from 10/01/2022 to the next year, we'll use the full year calculation first and then the remaining months. But let's calculate the days from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023. - October 2023 has 31 days. - November 2023 has 30 days. - December 2023 has 31 days. - January 2023 has 31 days. - February 2023 has 28 days (since 2023 is not a leap year). - March 2023 has 31 days. - April 2023 has 30 days. - May 2023 has 31 days. - And from June 1 to June 13 is 13 days. Now let's add up the days from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 (which is exactly one year): - 365 days for the year from 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023. Now, we need the days from October 1, 2023 to June 13, 2023. Let's calculate the days from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022: - October 2022: 31 days (from October 1 to October 31) = 31 days. - November 2022: 30 days. - December 2022: 31 days. Total for the rest of 2022: 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days. Now, all of 2023 up to June 13: - January 2023: 31 days. - February 2023: 28 days. - March 2023: 31 days. - April 2023: 30 days. - May 2023: 31 days. - And from June 1 to June 13 is 13 days. Adding these up: January: 31 days, February: 28 days, March: 31 days, April: 30 days, May: 31 days, June 1 to June 13: 13 days. Total for January to June 13, 2023 = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 13. Let's add them step by step: 31 (January) + 28 (February) = 59, 59 + 31 (March) = 90, 90 + 30 (April) = 120, 120 + 31 (May) = 151, 151 + 13 (June 1 to June 13) = 164 days. So the total number of days from October 1, 2022 to June 13, 2023 is the sum of the days from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 plus the days from January 1, 2023 to June 13, 2023. Total days from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 = 92 days. Total days from January 1, 2023 to June 13, 2023 = 164 days. Adding these together: 92 + 164 = 256 days. So the total number of days between 10/01/2022 and 06/13/2023 is 256 days. Now, to convert 256 days into weeks and days for gestational age: Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 256 by 7 to get the number of weeks and the remainder will give us the number of days. \[ 256 \div 7 = 36.5714 \] This means there are 36 full weeks. To find the number of remaining days, we calculate: \[ 256 - (36 \times 7) = 256 - 252 = 4 \] So, 256 days is equivalent to 36 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, the patient's estimated gestational age is (36 weeks, 4 days). The final answer is (36 weeks, 4 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, I first determined the total number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP) on 10/01/2022 and today's date, 06/13/2023.
