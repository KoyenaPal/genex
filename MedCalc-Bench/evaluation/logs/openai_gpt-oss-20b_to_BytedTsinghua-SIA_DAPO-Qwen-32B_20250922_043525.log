 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

Abnormal Liver Function: Present (hepatic impairment due to ALD) = 1 point. 3. Abnormal Renal Function: Present (elevated creatinine and reduced GFR) = 1 point. 4. Stroke: No previous stroke = 0 points. 5. Bleeding History or Predisposition: No mention of a bleeding history = 0 points. 6. Labile INR: No labile INR (normal INR) = 0 points. 7. Elderly (age > 65): The patient is 72 years old = 1 point. 8. Drugs or Alcohol: He consumes 9 drinks per week, which is more than 8 drinks per week = 1 point. Now, let's add up the points: - Hypertension: 1 - Abnormal Liver Function: 1 - Abnormal Renal Function: 1 - Stroke: 0 - Bleeding History or Predisposition: 0 - Labile INR: 0 - Elderly: 1 - Drugs or Alcohol: 1 Total score = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam. The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques (). A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative. Here is the task: What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?

Maybe use LDL as total? Not correct. Provide explanation.</think> It seems that the information required to calculate the Framingham Risk Score is incomplete. The Framingham Risk Score requires the following information: - Age - Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Systolic Blood Pressure - Whether the patient is on treatment for hypertension - Whether the patient is a smoker - Whether the patient has diabetes From the patient note: - Age: 50 years old - HDL: 43 mg/dL - LDL: 107 mg/dL - Blood Pressure: 131/83 mm Hg (so systolic BP is 131 mm Hg) - Smoking history: 3-pack year smoking history (implies he is a smoker or was a smoker) - Diabetes: No history of diabetes - Hypertension: No history of hypertension - Dyslipidemia: No history of dyslipidemia We do not have the total cholesterol level directly. We also do not know if the patient is currently on treatment for hypertension. To proceed, we will make some assumptions and use the available data to the best of our ability. Step 1: Calculate the total cholesterol if possible. The formula to estimate total cholesterol is: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5) Given: - LDL = 107 mg/dL - HDL = 43 mg/dL - Triglycerides = 98 mg/dL Plugging in the values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + 19.6 Total Cholesterol ≈ 169.6 mg/dL We'll use this estimated total cholesterol value. Step 2: Identify the other required variables. - Age: 50 years - Total Cholesterol: 169.6 mg/dL - HDL: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg - Smoking: Yes (given 3-pack year smoking history, we'll assume he is a smoker or has a smoking history) - Diabetes: No - Hypertension Treatment: No (no history of hypertension and no mention of treatment) Now, we can use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men: The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following points system: Points for Age: - 50 years: 9 Points for Total Cholesterol (mg/dL): - 160-199: 4 Since 169.6 falls within the range 160-199, the points are 4. Points for HDL (mg/dL): - 40-49: 3 Since the HDL is 43 mg/dL, it falls within the range 40-49, so the points are 3. Points for Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg): - 120-129: 1 Since the systolic BP is 131 mm Hg, it falls into the next range: - 130-139: 2 Since 131 falls within 130-139, the points are 2. Points for Treatment for Hypertension: - No: 0 Since there is no history of hypertension treatment, the points are 0. Points for Smoking: - Yes: 2 Since the patient has a smoking history, the points are 2. Now, we add up all the points: Total Points = Points for Age + Points for Total Cholesterol + Points for HDL + Points for Systolic BP + Points for Hypertension Treatment + Points for Smoking Total Points = 9 (Age) + 4 (Total Cholesterol) + 3 (HDL) + 2 (Systolic BP) + 0 (Hypertension Treatment) + 2 (Smoking) Total Points = 9 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 20 Using the total points to find the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease from the Framingham Risk Score table for men: For a total score of 20, the corresponding 10-year risk is approximately 10%. Thus, the patient's Framingham Risk Score indicates a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease of about 10%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need several pieces of information including age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and whether the patient is on treatment for hypertension.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL.

We have limited data. Likely cannot compute exactly.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the components of the APACHE II score. The APACHE II score consists of three parts: 1. The Acute Physiology Score (APS), which is based on 12 physiological variables. 2. Age points. 3. Chronic Health Score (CHS), which is based on the presence of chronic conditions. Step 2: Extract the relevant information from the patient note. Here's the information we have: - Age: 60 years old. - Heart rate: 95 bpm (tachycardia). - Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute. - Blood pressure: 135/75 mm Hg. - Temperature: 37.2°C. - Glasgow Coma Score (GCS): 14. - Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL. - Sodium: 138 mEq/L. - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L. - White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 12,000/µL. - Hematocrit: 43%. - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): pH = 7.32, FiO₂ = 55%, A-a gradient = 364. Step 3: Calculate the Acute Physiology Score (APS). We will use the following variables from the given information to calculate the APS: 1. Age: 60 years. 2. Heart rate: 95 bpm. 3. Mean arterial pressure (MAP): We can calculate MAP using the formula: MAP ≈ (2 * diastolic + systolic) / 3. - Systolic BP = 135 mm Hg. - Diastolic BP = 75 mm Hg. - MAP = (2 * 75 + 135) / 3 = (150 + 135) / 3 = 285 / 3 = 95 mm Hg. 4. Temperature: 37.2°C. 5. Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute. 6. PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: We need to calculate this using the given pH, FiO₂, and A-a gradient. However, we don't have the PaO₂ directly. Let's use the A-a gradient to find PaO₂. The A-a gradient is given as 364. The formula for the A-a gradient is: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PaO₂} - \left(\text{FiO₂} \times (P_{\text{atm}} - 47) - PaCO₂ \right). \] Since we don't have PaCO₂ and PaO₂ directly, let's simplify this by estimating PaO₂ using the given information. If the FiO₂ is 55%, and assuming a normal atmospheric pressure (P_atm) of 760 mm Hg, the formula becomes: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PaO₂} - \left(0.55 \times (760 - 47) - PaCO₂ \right). \] Let's assume a normal PaCO₂ of 40 mm Hg for simplicity. So, \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - \left(0.55 \times 713 - 40 \right). \] Calculate \(0.55 \times 713\): \[ 0.55 \times 713 \approx 392.15. \] Now plug this into the formula: \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - (392.15 - 40). \] \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - 352.15. \] Rearranging gives us: \[ \text{PaO₂} = 364 + 352.15 = 716.15. \] This seems unrealistic because it suggests an extremely high PaO₂ value. It appears there might be an error in the given A-a gradient or the interpretation. Let's try another approach. Since we have the pH and FiO₂, we can use the pH to estimate the PaCO₂ and then use the A-a gradient to find PaO₂. From the pH, we can calculate the PaCO₂ using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for pH: \[ \text{pH} = 7.32. \] The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is: \[ \text{pH} = 7.35 - 0.00018 \times (\text{PaCO₂} - 40). \] But since this is a bit complex and we don't have all the information, let's simplify and use the given information to estimate the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio. Let's assume the PaO₂ is such that the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio can be estimated. If the A-a gradient is very high (364), it suggests severe hypoxemia. Let's assume a very low PaO₂ for simplicity. Let's say PaO₂ is approximately 50 mm Hg (a value indicating severe hypoxemia). Then the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is: \[ \frac{\text{PaO₂}}{\text{FiO₂}} = \frac{50}{0.55} \approx 90.9. \] Now we have the following values for the APS calculation: - Heart rate: 95 bpm. - Mean arterial pressure (MAP): 95 mm Hg. - Temperature: 37.2°C. - Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute. - Glasgow Coma Score (GCS): 14. - Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL. - Sodium: 138 mEq/L. - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L. - WBC: 12,000/µL. - PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: approximately 90.9. Now let's calculate the points for each variable: 1. **Heart Rate:** - 95 bpm. - The scoring for heart rate is as follows: - < 40: 4 points. - 40-49: 3 points. - 50-59: 2 points. - 60-109: 1 point. - 110-129: 2 points. - 130-149: 3 points. - 150-169: 4 points. - ≥ 170: 5 points. Since 95 bpm falls in the range 60-109, it scores 1 point. 2. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** - MAP = 95 mm Hg. - The scoring for MAP is as follows: - < 30: 6 points. - 30-39: 5 points. - 40-49: 4 points. - 50-59: 3 points. - 60-69: 2 points. - 70-79: 1 point. - 80-89: 0 points. - 90-109: 0 points. - 110-119: 1 point. - 120-129: 2 points. - 130-139: 3 points. - ≥ 140: 4 points. Since MAP = 95 mm Hg falls in the range 90-109, it scores 0 points. 3. **Temperature:** - 37.2°C. - The scoring for temperature is as follows: - < 35: 3 points. - 35-35.9: 2 points. - 36-36.9: 1 point. - 37-38.9: 0 points. - 39-39.9: 1 point. - ≥ 40: 2 points. Since 37.2°C falls in the range 37-38.9, it scores 0 points. 4. **Respiratory Rate:** - 19 breaths per minute. - The scoring for respiratory rate is as follows: - < 5: 4 points. - 5-6: 3 points. - 7-10: 2 points. - 11-20: 1 point. - 21-24: 2 points. - 25-29: 3 points. - ≥ 30: 4 points. Since 19 breaths per minute falls in the range 11-20, it scores 1 point. 5. **PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio:** - Approximately 90.9. - The scoring for PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is as follows: - < 100: 5 points. - 100-199: 4 points. - 200-299: 3 points. - 300-399: 2 points. - 400-499: 1 point. - ≥ 500: 0 points. Since the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio is approximately 90.9, it falls in the range < 100, so it scores 5 points. 6. **Serum Sodium:** - 138 mEq/L. - The scoring for serum sodium is as follows: - < 120: 4 points. - 120-129: 3 points. - 130-134: 2 points. - 135-145: 0 points. - 146-154: 1 point. - ≥ 155: 2 points. Since 138 mEq/L falls in the range 135-145, it scores 0 points. 7. **Serum Potassium:** - 4.5 mEq/L. - The scoring for serum potassium is as follows: - < 3.0: 3 points. - 3.0-3.4: 2 points. - 3.5-4.4: 1 point. - 4.5-5.4: 0 points. - 5.5-5.9: 1 point. - 6.0-6.9: 2 points. - ≥ 7.0: 3 points. Since 4.5 mEq/L falls in the range 4.5-5.4, it scores 0 points. 8. **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** - Not provided. We'll assume it's not available and skip this for now. 9. **Creatinine:** - 3.8 mg/dL. - The scoring for creatinine is as follows: - < 0.8: 0 points. - 0.8-1.1: 0 points. - 1.2-1.9: 1 point. - 2.0-2.9: 2 points. - 3.0-4.9: 3 points. - ≥ 5.0: 4 points. Since 3.8 mg/dL falls in the range 3.0-4.9, it scores 3 points. 10. **WBC count:** - 12,000/µL. - The scoring for WBC count is as follows: - < 1: 4 points. - 1-3: 3 points. - 4-7: 2 points. - 8-19: 1 point. - 20-29: 2 points. - 30-39: 3 points. - ≥ 40: 4 points. Since 12,000/µL (or 12 K/µL) falls in the range 8-19, it scores 1 point. 11. **Hematocrit:** - 43%. - The scoring for hematocrit is as follows: - < 20: 4 points. - 20-29: 3 points. - 30-39: 2 points. - 40-50: 0 points. - > 50: 1 point. Since 43% falls in the range 40-50, it scores 0 points. 12. **Glasgow Coma Score (GCS):** - 14. - The scoring for GCS is as follows: - 15: 0 points. - 14: 1 point. - 13: 1 point. - 12: 2 points. - 11: 2 points. - 10: 3 points. - 9: 3 points. - 8: 4 points. - 7: 4 points. - 6: 5 points. - 5: 5 points. - 4: 6 points. - 3: 6 points. - 2: 7 points. - 1: 7 points. - 0: 8 points. Since GCS = 14, it scores 1 point. Now, let's sum up the points from the variables we have calculated: - Heart rate: 1 point. - MAP: 0 points. - Temperature: 0 points. - Respiratory rate: 1 point. - PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: 5 points. - Serum sodium: 0 points. - Serum potassium: 0 points. - Creatinine: 3 points. - WBC count: 1 point. - Hematocrit: 0 points. - GCS: 1 point. Adding these up: \[ 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12. \] So the Acute Physiology Score (APS) is 12. Step 4: Calculate the Age Points. The age points are calculated based on the patient's age: - Age 15-44: 0 points. - Age 45-54: 1 point. - Age 55-64: 2 points. - Age 65-74: 3 points. - Age 75-84: 4 points. - Age ≥ 85: 5 points. Since the patient is 60 years old, he falls into the age group 55-64, which corresponds to 2 points. Step 5: Calculate the Chronic Health Score (CHS). The patient has a history of liver failure and immunocompromise. The presence of chronic health conditions such as liver failure and immunocompromise would typically add points to the CHS. For the APACHE II score, the presence of chronic health conditions like liver disease and immunocompromise can add points. Specifically: - Chronic health conditions like liver disease and immunocompromise can each add points. However, the APACHE II score typically assigns 1 point for each major chronic condition. Since the patient has two significant chronic conditions (liver failure and immunocompromise), we will assign 1 point for each condition. So, the Chronic Health Score (CHS) = 1 (for liver failure) + 1 (for immunocompromise) = 2 points. Step 6: Calculate the APACHE II score. The APACHE II score is the sum of the Acute Physiology Score (APS), Age Points, and Chronic Health Score (CHS). \[ \text{APACHE II score} = \text{APS} + \text{Age Points} + \text{CHS} = 12 + 2 + 2 = 16. \] Thus, the APACHE II score for this patient is 16. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score, we need to determine the Acute Physiology Score (APS), Age Points, and Chronic Health Score (CHS).

We estimated the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio to be approximately 90.9 based on the given A-a gradient and assumed a low PaO₂ value. Now, let's calculate the points for each variable in the APS: 1. Heart rate: 95 bpm -> 1 point. 2. MAP: 95 mm Hg -> 0 points. 3. Temperature: 37.2°C -> 0 points. 4. Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute -> 1 point. 5. PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio: ~90.9 -> 5 points. 6.

GCS: 14 -> 1 point. Adding these up gives the APS: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 12 points. For Age Points: - The patient is 60 years old, which falls into the 55-64 age group, giving 2 points. For Chronic Health Score (CHS): - The patient has liver failure and immunocompromise, each contributing 1 point, so CHS = 2 points. Finally, the APACHE II score is the sum of APS, Age Points, and CHS: \[ \text{APACHE II score} = 12 (APS) + 2 (Age Points) + 2 (CHS) = 16. \] Thus, the APACHE II score is 16.", "answer": "16"}

Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, Height in meters = 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Step 2: Use the formula for weight based on BMI. The formula for BMI is: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}}. \] Rearranging this to find the weight gives us: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2. \] Given the target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2 and the height is 1.9558 m, we need to calculate the height squared first. Step 3: Calculate the square of the height. \[ \text{(Height)^2} = (1.9558)^2. \] Let's calculate this: \[ (1.9558)^2 = 3.82489364. \] Step 4: Now multiply this result by the target BMI (19.7 kg/m^2). \[ \text{Target Weight (kg)} = 19.7 \times 3.82489364. \] Now perform the multiplication: \[ 19.7 \times 3.82489364. \] Let's break this multiplication into simpler steps. First, calculate \( 19.7 * 3.825 \) approximately for easier calculation. \[ 19.7 * 3.825 \approx 19.7 * 3.825. \] We can split this multiplication as follows: \[ 19.7 * 3.825 = 19.7 * (3.8 + 0.025). \] Now, distribute the multiplication: \[ 19.7 * 3.8 + 19.7 * 0.025. \] Calculate each term separately. 1. Calculate \( 19.7 * 3.8 \): \[ 19.7 * 3.8 = (19.7 * 38) / 10. \] \[ 19.7 * 38 = 19.7 * 30 + 19.7 * 8. \] \[ 19.7 * 30 = 591, \] \[ 19.7 * 8 = 157.6. \] Adding these together gives: \[ 591 + 157.6 = 748.6. \] Now divide by 10: \[ 748.6 / 10 = 74.86. \] So, \[ 19.7 * 3.8 = 74.86. \] 2. Now calculate \( 19.7 * 0.025 \): \[ 19.7 * 0.025 = (19.7 * 25) / 1000. \] \[ 19.7 * 25 = 492.5. \] Now divide by 1000: \[ 492.5 / 1000 = 0.4925. \] So, \[ 19.7 * 0.025 = 0.4925. \] Now add the two results from the distribution: \[ 19.7 * 3.825 = 74.86 + 0.4925 = 75.3525. \] So, \[ 19.7 * 3.82489364 \approx 75.35. \] To be more precise, let's multiply 19.7 by 3.82489364 directly. \[ 19.7 * 3.82489364 = 19.7 * 3.82489364. \] Let's split this multiplication: \[ 19.7 * 3.82489364 = (19 * 3.82489364) + (0.7 * 3.82489364). \] First, calculate \( 19 * 3.82489364 \): \[ 19 * 3.82489364 = 72.673. \] Now calculate \( 0.7 * 3.82489364 \): \[ 0.7 * 3.82489364 = 2.677425548. \] Now add the two results together: \[ 72.673 + 2.677425548 = 75.350425548. \] Rounding this to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get approximately 75.35 kg. Thus the target weight is approximately 75.35 kg. So the final answer is approximately 75.35 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))^2. Rearranging this to find the weight gives us: Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height (m))^2. The patient's height is 77 inches. First, convert the height from inches to meters. Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, the height in meters is 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Next, we calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2 = 3.82489364 m^2. The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight: Weight (kg) = 19.7 * 3.82489364. Performing the multiplication: 19.7 * 3.82489364 ≈ 75.35 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}\). \[ \frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}\right)^{-0.329}\). \[ \left(12.714\right)^{-0.329} \] Using a calculator: \[ 12.714^{-0.329} \approx 0.459 \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.993^{\text{Age}}\). \[ 0.993^{38} \] Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.766 \] Step 4: Plug these values into the CKD-EPI formula for females. \[ GFR = 144 \times 0.459 \times 0.766 \times 1.018 \] Now, multiply these step by step. First, multiply 144 and 0.459: \[ 144 \times 0.459 \approx 66.1 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.766: \[ 66.1 \times 0.766 \approx 50.6 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 50.6 \times 1.018 \approx 51.5 \] So the GFR is approximately 51.5 mL/min/1.73 m². It seems I made an error in the initial approach. Let's use the correct CKD-EPI formula for 2021, which is: \[ GFR = 141 \times \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α \times \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times 1.018 \] where for females, κ = 0.7 and α = -0.329. Given: - Scr = 8.9 mg/dL - Age = 38 years - Female Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}\). \[ \frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)\). Since \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714\), \[ \min\left(12.714, 1\right) = 1. \] Step 3: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)\). Since \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714\), \[ \max\left(12.714, 1\right) = 12.714. \] Step 4: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α\). Since \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 1\), \[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α = 1^{-0.329} = 1. \] Step 5: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209}\). Since \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 12.714\), \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} = 12.714^{-1.209}. \] Using a calculator: \[ 12.714^{-1.209} \approx 0.046. \] Step 6: Calculate \(0.993^{\text{Age}}\). Since Age = 38, \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.766. \] Step 7: Plug all these values into the CKD-EPI formula. \[ GFR = 141 \times 1 \times 0.046 \times 0.766 \times 1.018. \] Now, multiply step by step. First, multiply 141 and 0.046: \[ 141 \times 0.046 \approx 6.486. \] Next, multiply the result by 0.766: \[ 6.486 \times 0.766 \approx 4.98. \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 4.98 \times 1.018 \approx 5.07. \] So the GFR is approximately 5.07 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus the final answer is approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m². {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for a female patient with a serum creatinine of 8.9 mg/dL and age 38, we use the formula: \n\n\[ GFR = 141 \times \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α \times \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times 1.018 \]\nwhere for females, κ = 0.7 and α = -0.329.\n\nStep 1: Calculate \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}\).\n\[ \frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714. \]\n\nStep 2: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right).\)\nSince \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714,\)\n\[ \min\left(12.714, 1\right) = 1. \]\n\nStep 3: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right).\)\nSince \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714,\)\n\[ \max\left(12.714, 1\right) = 12.714. \]\n\nStep 4: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α.\)\nSince \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 1,\)\n\[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α = 1^{-0.329} = 1. \]\n\nStep 5: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209}.\)\nSince \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 12.714,\)\n\[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} = 12.714^{-1.209}. \]\nUsing a calculator, we get\n\[ 12.714^{-1.209} \approx 0.046. \]\n\nStep 6: Calculate \(0.993^{\text{Age}}.\)\nSince Age = 38,\n\[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.766. \]\n\nStep 7: Plug all these values into the CKD-EPI formula.\n\[ GFR = 141 \times 1 \times 0.046 \times 0.766 \times 1.018. \]\nNow multiply step by step.\nFirst, multiply 141 and 0.046:\n\[ 141 \times 0.046 \approx 6.486. \]\nNext, multiply the result by 0.766:\n\[ 6.486 \times 0.766 \approx 4.98. \]\nFinally, multiply the result by 1.018:\n\[ 4.98 \times 1.018 \approx 5.07. \]\nSo the GFR is approximately 5.07 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "5"} {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for a female patient with a serum creatinine of 8.9 mg/dL and age 38, we use the formula: \n\n\[ GFR = 141 \times \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α \times \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times 1.018 \]\nwhere for females, κ = 0.7 and α = -0.329.\n\nStep 1: Calculate \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}\).\n\[ \frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714. \]\n\nStep 2: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right).\)\nSince \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714,\)\n\[ \min\left(12.714, 1\right) = 1. \]\n\nStep 3: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right).\)\nSince \(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ} = 12.714,\)\n\[ \max\left(12.714, 1\right) = 12.714. \]\n\nStep 4: Calculate \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α.\)\nSince \(\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 1,\)\n\[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^α = 1^{-0.329} = 1. \]\n\nStep 5: Calculate \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209}.\)\nSince \(\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right) = 12.714,\)\n\[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{κ}, 1\right)^{-1.209} = 12.714^{-1.209}. \]\nUsing a calculator, we get\n\[ 12.714^{-1.209} \approx 0.046. \]\n\nStep 6: Calculate \(0.993^{\text{Age}}.\)\nSince Age = 38,\n\[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.766. \]\n\nStep 7: Plug all these values into the CKD-EPI formula.\n\[ GFR = 141 \times 1 \times 0.046 \times 0.766 \times 1.018. \]\nNow multiply step by step.\nFirst, multiply 141 and 0.046:\n\[ 141 \times 0.046 \approx 6.486. \]\nNext, multiply the result by 0.766:\n\[ 6.486 \times 0.766 \approx 4.98. \]\nFinally, multiply the result by 1.018:\n\[ 4.98 \times 1.018 \approx 5.07. \]\nSo the GFR is approximately 5.07 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "5"}

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

He had sore mouth but not ear pain.</think> But it seems like the FeverPAIN score is not directly applicable to this case since the patient's primary issue is related to accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide and not a sore throat. Let's break down the information given in the patient note to see if we can calculate a FeverPAIN score: 1. **Fever**: The patient's temperature is not explicitly mentioned. We have blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, and oxygen saturation, but no temperature. 2. **Ear pain**: There is no mention of ear pain in the patient's symptoms or examination findings. 3. **Inflammation (or other components)**: The term "Inflammation" is not directly mentioned in the context of the patient's symptoms or examination findings. Since the patient note does not provide information about fever or ear pain, and the context is about hydrogen peroxide ingestion rather than a sore throat, it seems inappropriate to calculate a FeverPAIN score for this patient. However, if we were to try to calculate a FeverPAIN score based on the information provided: - **Fever**: Not mentioned. - **Ear pain**: Not mentioned. - **Inflammation**: The patient has elevated leukocyte count (18.9 × 10^3 K/mm^3), which suggests inflammation or infection. But the FeverPAIN score typically involves specific symptoms like fever and ear pain. Since the FeverPAIN score is used to predict strep throat and the patient's primary issue is hydrogen peroxide ingestion, it doesn't seem relevant here. Thus, the FeverPAIN score cannot be calculated from the given information. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient note describes a case of accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and some blood in the vomitus. The patient's presentation includes elevated blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, and oxygen saturation. The laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lipase. The CT scan reveals gastric pneumatosis and portal venous air. The patient was admitted for observation and underwent an endoscopy that showed esophagitis and pangastritis.\n\nHowever, the FeverPAIN score is used to assess the likelihood of strep throat and involves the following components: Fever (≥38°C), Ear pain, and Inflammation (as indicated by elevated white blood cell count).\n\nFrom the given information:\n- **Fever**: The patient's temperature is not explicitly mentioned.\n- **Ear pain**: There is no mention of ear pain.\n- **Inflammation**: The elevated leukocyte count suggests inflammation.\n\nSince the patient note does not provide a temperature reading and there is no mention of ear pain, we cannot accurately calculate the FeverPAIN score.\n\nTherefore, the FeverPAIN score cannot be determined from the provided information.", "answer": "0"} But since the FeverPAIN score is not applicable to this case, the correct approach would be to say that the FeverPAIN score is not applicable. So the final answer is that the FeverPAIN score is not applicable to this case. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient note describes a case of accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and some blood in the vomitus.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

Might assume current insulin 26? But unrealistic.</think> It seems we don't have enough information to calculate HOMA-IR directly. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the required parameters for HOMA-IR calculation. HOMA-IR = (Fasting Insulin (µU/mL) * Fasting Glucose (mmol/L)) / 22.5 Step 2: Extract the available data from the patient note. - Initial fasting glucose (FG): 210 mg/dL - Fasting glucose after starting Exenatide: 163 mg/dL - Fasting glucose after 6 months of treatment with Exenatide: Not directly given, but we have HbA1c 8.3%. - Weight at the start of Exenatide: 131.1 kg - Weight at the time of surgery: 131.5 kg - Weight 2 months postoperatively: 118.9 kg - HbA1c at the start of Exenatide: 10.2% - HbA1c after 2 months of Exenatide: 7.9% - HbA1c after 6 months of Exenatide: 8.3% - HbA1c postoperatively (at 2 months): 5.8% Step 3: Convert the fasting glucose values to mmol/L if needed. - 210 mg/dL = 210 / 18 = 11.67 mmol/L - 163 mg/dL = 163 / 18 = 9.06 mmol/L Step 4: Identify the change in insulin. The note says "insulin (−26 uIU/ml)," which means the insulin level decreased by 26 uIU/mL from some baseline. Since we don't have the baseline insulin level, we can't directly calculate the current insulin level. Step 5: Consider the information given about the changes in glucose and insulin. The note mentions that after 6 months of treatment with Exenatide, there was a reduction in fasting glucose by 17 mg/dL, a reduction in insulin by 26 uIU/mL, and a reduction in triglycerides by 12 mg/dL. Let's assume the fasting glucose after 6 months is the one that corresponds to the change in glucose (17 mg/dL reduction from some baseline). If the fasting glucose after starting Exenatide was 163 mg/dL, and it reduced by 17 mg/dL over the next 6 months, the fasting glucose after 6 months would be: 163 mg/dL - 17 mg/dL = 146 mg/dL Convert this to mmol/L: 146 mg/dL = 146 / 18 = 8.11 mmol/L Now, let's assume the insulin level after starting Exenatide was some baseline insulin level, and it decreased by 26 uIU/mL over the next 6 months. Let's denote the initial fasting insulin level as \( I_0 \). After 6 months, the insulin level would be \( I_0 - 26 \) uIU/mL. To calculate HOMA-IR after 6 months, we need both the fasting glucose and fasting insulin at that time. From the information above: - Fasting glucose after 6 months = 146 mg/dL = 8.11 mmol/L - Fasting insulin after 6 months = \( I_0 - 26 \) uIU/mL But we still need the baseline insulin \( I_0 \). Since we don't have the baseline insulin, we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. However, let's try another approach using the information given about the HbA1c and the changes. The HbA1c after 6 months is 8.3%. We can estimate the average glucose corresponding to this HbA1c. The formula to convert HbA1c to estimated average glucose (eAG) in mg/dL is: eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 * HbA1c - 46.7 For HbA1c 8.3%: eAG = 28.7 * 8.3 - 46.7 ≈ 28.7 * 8.3 - 46.7 ≈ 238.21 - 46.7 ≈ 191.51 mg/dL Convert this to mmol/L: 191.51 mg/dL = 191.51 / 18 ≈ 10.64 mmol/L So, the estimated average glucose corresponding to HbA1c 8.3% is approximately 10.64 mmol/L. Now, let's use this average glucose value to calculate HOMA-IR if we assume the fasting insulin is the change from baseline. If the insulin decreased by 26 uIU/mL over 6 months, and we don't have the baseline, we can't calculate the exact HOMA-IR. Since the problem seems unsolvable with the given data, the answer is that we cannot calculate the HOMA-IR score with the information provided. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate HOMA-IR, we need both fasting insulin and fasting glucose levels. The note provides changes in insulin and glucose but does not give the actual fasting insulin levels. The fasting glucose levels change over time, and we have an estimated average glucose from HbA1c, but without the fasting insulin, we cannot calculate HOMA-IR.", "answer": "Cannot be calculated"} So the final JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate HOMA-IR, we need both fasting insulin and fasting glucose levels.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.

Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type.

Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.

Step 2: The cycle length is 25 days. Step 3: Ovulation typically occurs around 14 days before the next expected period. Since the cycle length is 25 days, ovulation would occur approximately 25 - 14 = 11 days after the LMP. Now, we need to add 11 days to the LMP (02/08/2024) to find the estimated date of ovulation, which is also the estimated date of conception. Let's add 11 days to 02/08/2024. February 8, 2024 + 11 days. Counting the days: - February 8 + 1 day = February 9 - February 9 + 1 day = February 10 - February 10 + 1 day = February 11 - February 11 + 1 day = February 12 - February 12 + 1 day = February 13 - February 13 + 1 day = February 14 - February 14 + 1 day = February 15 - February 15 + 1 day = February 16 - February 16 + 1 day = February 17 - February 17 + 1 day = February 18 - February 18 + 1 day = February 19 So, 11 days after February 8, 2024, is February 19, 2024. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is February 19, 2024, or 02/19/2024. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the estimated date of conception, we use the information that ovulation typically occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle, specifically around 14 days before the next expected period.

Convert the doses of each medication to their Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME). - For OxyCODONE: The patient takes 60 mg of OxyCODONE 1 time a day. The conversion factor from OxyCODONE to MME is 1.5. Therefore, the MME for OxyCODONE is: \[ 60 \, \text{mg of OxyCODONE} \times 1.5 = 90 \, \text{MME}.\] - For HYDROmorphone: The patient takes 70 mg of HYDROmorphone 2 times a day. The conversion factor from HYDROmorphone to MME is 4. Therefore, the total daily dose of HYDROmorphone is: \[ 70 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 140 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Now, convert this to MME: \[ 140 \, \text{mg of HYDROmorphone} \times 4 = 560 \, \text{MME}.\] - For Codeine: The patient takes 10 mg of Codeine 2 times a day. The conversion factor from Codeine to MME is 0.15. Therefore, the total daily dose of Codeine is: \[ 10 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 20 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Now, convert this to MME: \[ 20 \, \text{mg of Codeine} \times 0.15 = 3 \, \text{MME}.\] 2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

Black factor 1.212 => 5.96.</think> However, the creatinine value given is 8 mg/dL. We need to convert this to the units used in the MDRD equation, which typically uses serum creatinine in mg/dL. The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} \times (\text{Age})^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \, (\text{if female}) \times 1.212 \, (\text{if black}). \] Given: - Serum Creatinine (Scr) = 8 mg/dL. - Age = 73 years. - The patient is female. - The patient is African American. Let's calculate step by step. Step 1: Calculate \((\text{Scr})^{-1.154}\). \[ (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} = 8^{-1.154}. \] Using a calculator: \[ 8^{-1.154} \approx 0.0907. \] Step 2: Calculate \((\text{Age})^{-0.203}\). \[ (\text{Age})^{-0.203} = 73^{-0.203}. \] Using a calculator: \[ 73^{-0.203} \approx 0.418. \] Now, plug these values into the MDRD equation: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times 0.0907 \times 0.418 \times 0.742 \times 1.212. \] Let's multiply these step by step. Step 3: Multiply the constants together stepwise. First, multiply 175 by 0.0907: \[ 175 \times 0.0907 \approx 15.8725. \] Next, multiply the result by 0.418: \[ 15.8725 \times 0.418 \approx 6.63. \] Then, multiply by 0.742: \[ 6.63 \times 0.742 \approx 4.91. \] Finally, multiply by 1.212: \[ 4.91 \times 1.212 \approx 5.95. \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 5.95 mL/min/1.73 m².

She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.\nEven after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ).

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.\nSerology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.\nBecause of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.\nOver the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 250.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (250.0 - 100) = 139.6 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.6 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.\nOn day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.\nOn day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.', 'Question': "What is the patient's delta ratio?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '0.67', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need delta ratio = (ALP/AST) / (GGT/ALT).  \nUse values?

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Then correction: (4 - albumin) = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2.</think> Now, calculate the anion gap (AG). The formula for AG is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). From the given data: - Sodium (Na) = 148 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 6 mmol/L Plugging these values into the formula for AG: AG = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 mEq/L. Now, we have the anion gap (AG) = 32 mEq/L. The albumin-corrected anion gap is given by the formula: Corrected AG = AG - (4 - albumin). Given that the albumin is 4.2 g/dL. Now, calculate the correction term: 4 - albumin = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2. So the corrected AG = AG - (4 - albumin) = 32 - (-0.2) = 32 + 0.2 = 32.2 mEq/L. But the question asks for the "albumin corrected delta gap." The term "delta gap" is not a standard term in clinical chemistry. It seems like it might be a misinterpretation or a typo. The term "delta gap" is not commonly used in the context of acid-base disorders. However, if we interpret the "delta gap" as the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap, the normal anion gap is typically around 8-16 mEq/L. Let's calculate the delta gap as the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. Let's use the normal anion gap as 12 mEq/L for simplicity. Delta gap = Measured AG - Normal AG = 32 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20 mEq/L. Now, we need to correct this delta gap for albumin. The albumin-corrected delta gap would be the albumin-corrected anion gap minus the normal anion gap. Corrected AG = 32.2 mEq/L (from the calculation above). So, the albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 32.2 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20.2 mEq/L. Thus the albumin-corrected delta gap is 20.2 mEq/L. So the final answer is 20.2 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we first need to calculate the anion gap (AG). The formula for AG is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). From the given data: Sodium (Na) = 148 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L, and Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 6 mmol/L. Plugging these values into the formula for AG gives us: AG = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 mEq/L. The albumin level is given as 4.2 g/dL. The formula to correct the anion gap for albumin is: Corrected AG = AG - (4 - albumin). Using the albumin value of 4.2 g/dL, we get: 4 - albumin = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2. Therefore, the corrected AG = 32 - (-0.2) = 32 + 0.2 = 32.2 mEq/L. The term 'delta gap' is the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. Let's use the normal anion gap as 12 mEq/L. The delta gap is thus: Measured AG - Normal AG = 32 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20 mEq/L. To find the albumin-corrected delta gap, we use the corrected AG instead of the measured AG. So, the albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 32.2 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20.2 mEq/L.", "answer": "20.2"}

Round to one decimal place if desired.\\n\\nAnswer: 22.2 mEq/L.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '20.2', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we first need to calculate the anion gap (AG). The formula for AG is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). From the given data: Sodium (Na) = 148 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L, and Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 6 mmol/L. Plugging these values into the formula for AG gives us: AG = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 mEq/L. The albumin level is given as 4.2 g/dL. The formula to correct the anion gap for albumin is: Corrected AG = AG - (4 - albumin). Using the albumin value of 4.2 g/dL, we get: 4 - albumin = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2. Therefore, the corrected AG = 32 - (-0.2) = 32 + 0.2 = 32.2 mEq/L. The term 'delta gap' is the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. Let's use the normal anion gap as 12 mEq/L. The delta gap is thus: Measured AG - Normal AG = 32 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20 mEq/L. To find the albumin-corrected delta gap, we use the corrected AG instead of the measured AG. So, the albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 32.2 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 20.2 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 16%|█▌        | 16/100 [16:24<55:19, 39.52s/it]

But the symptoms also suggest a possible electrolyte imbalance or another condition.</think> However, the given task is to calculate the corrected sodium concentration. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 100 * 1.6 Given: - Measured Sodium (Na+) = 134 mEq/L - Glucose = 70 mg/dL Let's plug in the values into the formula: Corrected Sodium = 134 + (70 - 100) / 100 * 1.6 Calculate the difference in glucose: 70 - 100 = -30 Now, divide by 100: -30 / 100 = -0.3 Then multiply by 1.6: -0.3 * 1.6 = -0.48 Finally, add this to the measured sodium: Corrected Sodium = 134 + (-0.48) = 134 - 0.48 = 133.52 Since the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL, the correction actually decreases the sodium level slightly. But the question seems to be asking for the corrected sodium concentration, and since the glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is below the threshold of 100 mg/dL, the correction would make the sodium level even lower. However, the given information does not suggest any other significant factors that would require a correction for sodium other than hyperglycemia. So the corrected sodium concentration is approximately 133.52 mEq/L. But since the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL, the correction is not typically applied because it would make the sodium level lower, and the measured sodium is already within the normal range. Thus, the corrected sodium concentration is essentially the same as the measured sodium concentration in this case because the glucose level is below the threshold for correction. Therefore, the corrected sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we use the formula: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 100 * 1.6.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

The formula for the anion gap is: \[ \text{AG} = \text{Na} - (\text{Cl} + \text{HCO}_3) \] Using the given values: - Na = 139 mEq/L - Cl = 102 mEq/L - HCO3 = 30 mEq/L Plugging in these values: \[ \text{AG} = 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Step 2: Correct the anion gap for the albumin level. The formula to correct the anion gap for albumin is: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = \text{AG} + 2.5 \times (4 - \text{Albumin}) \] Given that the albumin level is 1.5 g/dL, we plug in the values: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.5) \] Calculate the term inside the parenthesis first: \[ 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 \] Now multiply this by 2.5: \[ 2.5 \times 2.5 = 6.25 \] Add this to the original anion gap: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25 \, \text{mEq/L} \] So the corrected anion gap is 13.25 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient's last menstrual period was on 02/03/2012. Her cycle length is 28 days.

Here is the task:
Using Naegele's Rule for estimated due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length, what is the the patient's estimated due date? Your response should be in the format of M/D/Y (ie 08/31/2023, 07/03/2000) with just the date and not other text.

THINKING USED We need to compute due date.  
LMP 02/03/2012.  
Cycle 28 days.  
Naegele: add 280 days (40 weeks).  
02/03/2012 + 280 days.  
Let's calculate.  
2012 is leap year.  
Feb 3 2012.  
Add 280 days.  
Let's compute: 2012-02-03 to 2012-12-31?  
Let's do month by month.  
Feb 2012: 29 days total.  
From Feb 3 to Feb 29 inclusive? Actually days remaining in Feb after Feb 3: Feb 3 to Feb 29 = 27 days (since Feb 3 is day 3, days 3-29 inclusive = 27).  
But easier: add 280 days.  
Let's compute using date arithmetic: 2012-02-03 + 280 days.  
We can compute by adding 280 days: 280 = 9 months (approx).  
Let's check: Feb 3 to Mar 3 = 28 days (since 2012 leap).  
Then to Apr 3 = 30 days? Wait months: Feb 3 to Mar 3 28 days. Mar 3 to Apr 3 31 days. Apr 3 to May 3 30 days. May 3 to Jun 3 31 days. Jun 3 to Jul 3 30 days. Jul 3 to Aug 3 31 days. Aug 3 to Sep 3 31 days. Sep 3 to Oct 3 30 days. Oct 3 to Nov 3 31 days.  
Sum: 28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31 = 273 days.  
Need 280, so add 7 more days: Nov 3 + 7 days = Nov 10.  
But earlier I thought Nov 9.  
Let's double-check.  
Let's compute more precisely: Use date addition: Feb 3 2012 + 280 days.  
We can compute by adding 280 days to Feb 3.  
Let's use day-of-year approach.  
2012 is leap year.  
Day numbers: Jan 1 = 1.  
Feb 3 = 34? Jan 31 days + Feb 3 = 34.  
Add 280 days -> day 34+280=314.  
Day 314 of 2012.  
In leap year, day 314 corresponds to?  
Let's compute: Jan 31, Feb 29, Mar 31, Apr 30, May 31, Jun 30, Jul 31, Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 31, Nov 30, Dec 31.  
Cumulative days: Jan 31, Feb 60, Mar 91, Apr 121, May 152, Jun 182, Jul 213, Aug 244, Sep 274, Oct 305, Nov 335, Dec 366.  
Day 314 falls between Oct 305 and Nov 335.  
So day 314 - 305 = 9.  
My earlier calculation gave Nov 10 due to miscount.  
Let's verify: 280 days after Feb 3 inclusive? Usually due date is 280 days after LMP, not inclusive.

My earlier calculation gave Nov 10 due to miscount. Let's verify: 280 days after Feb 3 inclusive? Usually due date is 280 days after LMP, not inclusive.</think> To calculate the due date using Naegele's Rule, we add 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), which is February 3, 2012. Step-by-step: 1. The LMP is February 3, 2012. 2. According to Naegele's Rule, we add 280 days to this date. Let's break it down systematically: - First, we can add 7 days to February 3, 2012, to get to February 10, 2012. - Next, we add 28 days to February 10, 2012, to get to March 10, 2012 (since February has 29 days in 2012, and February 10 + 21 days = March 10). - We continue adding months and days systematically. Alternatively, we can use a more structured approach by adding months and days. Since the cycle length is 28 days (which is the standard cycle length), we can use the rule that involves adding 7 days to the LMP and then adding 9 months. So, let's apply this rule: 1. Add 7 days to February 3, 2012. - February 3 + 7 days = February 10, 2012. 2. Now, add 9 months to February 10, 2012. - February + 9 months = November. - So, February 10 + 9 months = November 10. Therefore, the estimated due date is November 10, 2012. Thus, the estimated due date is 11/10/2012. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the due date using Naegele's Rule, we add 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), which is February 3, 2012.

To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old female residing in a nursing home is brought to the outpatient department by her nurse for a regular health check. Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L. An arterial blood gas analysis reports a pH of 7.40 and PaO2 at 80 mm Hg. Chest X-rays show indications of pleural effusion.

THINKING USED Need PSI calculation.  
Need points: age 75 => 75*? Actually PSI uses age in years.  
For female?  
Age 75 => 75 points.  
Comorbidities: CHF present => 10 points.  
No liver disease, no neoplasm.  
Respiratory rate 22 => >20 gives 20 points.  
BUN 27 mg/dL => >30? Actually BUN >30 gives 20 points; 20-30 gives 10? Wait PSI: BUN >30 = 20, 20-30 = 10.  
So 27 => 10 points.  
Sodium 139 normal => 0.  
Hematocrit 39% => >30 => 0? Actually hematocrit <30 gives 20, 30-40 gives 10.  
So 39 => 10 points.  
Glucose 180 mg/dL => >200? 200-300 gives 10.  
So 180 => 0.  
PaO2 80 mmHg => >59 => 0.  
Temperature 36.5 normal => 0.  
Pulse 82 normal => 0.  
Respiratory rate 22 => 20.  
Chest X-ray pleural effusion => 10? Actually pleural effusion gives 10.

Chest X-ray findings: Pleural effusion => 10 points. Now, sum up all the points: - Age: 75 points - CHF: 10 points - Respiratory rate > 20: 20 points - BUN 20-30: 10 points - Hematocrit 30-40: 10 points - Pleural effusion: 10 points Total score = 75 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 135 points. According to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the score ranges and their corresponding risk categories are as follows: - 0-47: Class I (Low risk) - 48-79: Class II (Moderate risk) - 80-134: Class III (High risk) - 135-155: Class IV (Very high risk) - >156: Class V (Extremely high risk) Since the total score is 135, it falls into Class IV (Very high risk).

We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75.0 = 75.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75.0 - 10 = 65.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 10 = 85.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85.0 + 10 = 95.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 82.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4.

The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

Others 0.</think> Now let's calculate the score step by step: 1. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen): The patient's BUN is 18 mg/dL. According to the Glasgow-Blatchford score: - BUN < 10 = 0 - 10-20 = 1 - 20-30 = 2 - >30 = 3 Since the BUN is 18 mg/dL, it falls into the range 10-20, so the score for BUN is 1. 2. Hemoglobin: The patient's hemoglobin is 13 g/dL. According to the Glasgow-Blatchford score for males: - <12 = 3 - 12-13.9 = 2 - 14-15.9 = 1 - >=16 = 0 Since the hemoglobin is 13 g/dL, it falls into the range 12-13.9, so the score for hemoglobin is 2. 3. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP): The patient's SBP is 130 mm Hg. According to the Glasgow-Blatchford score: - <90 = 12 - 90-100 = 4 - 101-110 = 2 - 111-120 = 1 - >120 = 0 Since the SBP is 130 mm Hg, it is greater than 120, so the score for SBP is 0. 4. Heart Rate (HR): The patient's heart rate is 88 beats per minute. According to the Glasgow-Blatchford score: - >100 = 13 - 90-100 = 7 - 80-89 = 3 - 70-79 = 1 - <70 = 0 Since the heart rate is 88 bpm, it falls into the range 80-89, so the score for HR is 3. 5. Presence of Melena: The patient has melena (dark, tarry stools). According to the Glasgow-Blatchford score, the presence of melena gives a score of 2. 6. Syncope: There is no mention of syncope in the patient's presentation. Therefore, the score for syncope is 0. 7. Hepatic Disease: There is no mention of hepatic disease. Therefore, the score for hepatic disease is 0. 8. Cardiac Failure: The patient claims no history of heart failure. Therefore, the score for cardiac failure is 0. Now, we sum up all the scores: - BUN: 1 - Hemoglobin: 2 - SBP: 0 - HR: 3 - Melena: 2 - Syncope: 0 - Hepatic Disease: 0 - Cardiac Failure: 0 Total score = 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8. So the patient's Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding score is 8. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding score, we need to evaluate several parameters from the patient's data.

The scoring for HR is:\n - >100 = 13\n - 90-100 = 7\n - 80-89 = 3\n - 70-79 = 1\n - <70 = 0\nSince the heart rate is 88 bpm, it falls within the range 80-89, so the score for HR is 3.\n\n5. Presence of Melena: The patient has melena. The presence of melena scores 2 points.\n\n6. Syncope: There is no mention of syncope, so the score for syncope is 0.\n\n7. Hepatic Disease: There is no mention of hepatic disease, so the score for hepatic disease is 0.\n\n8.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine. Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%.

Usually albumin-corrected delta ratio = (albumin corrected creatinine ratio?) Actually albumin corrected delta ratio maybe used in kidney injury? Might be ratio of albumin to creatinine? But "albumin corrected delta ratio" maybe refers to "albumin-corrected delta creatinine ratio" used in acute kidney injury? Not sure. Maybe they want albumin corrected delta ratio = (albumin corrected creatinine ratio) / (baseline creatinine). But unclear. Given data: albumin 3.8 g/dL. Creatinine 10.48 mg/dL. Albumin corrected creatinine ratio = (albumin / creatinine) * 100? Actually albumin-corrected creatinine ratio used to adjust for hypoalbuminemia: corrected creatinine = measured creatinine * (normal albumin / patient albumin). Normal albumin ~4.0 g/dL.</think> But the question seems to be about the albumin-corrected delta ratio, which is not a standard term. Let's assume it's asking for the change in creatinine over time and then correct it for albumin. The patient's creatinine levels are given as: - Initial creatinine: 1.15 mg/dL (3 years prior) - Current creatinine: 10.48 mg/dL Let's calculate the delta creatinine: Delta creatinine = Current creatinine - Initial creatinine = 10.48 - 1.15 = 9.33 mg/dL Now, let's correct this delta creatinine for albumin. The formula for albumin-corrected creatinine is: Corrected Creatinine = Measured Creatinine * (Normal Albumin / Patient Albumin) But since we need the albumin-corrected delta ratio, we'll use the delta creatinine and correct it for albumin. Let's assume the normal albumin is 4.0 g/dL and the patient's albumin is 3.8 g/dL. The albumin-corrected delta creatinine would be: Albumin-corrected Delta Creatinine = Delta Creatinine * (Normal Albumin / Patient Albumin) = 9.33 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 9.33 * 1.05263 ≈ 9.83 mg/dL So the albumin-corrected delta ratio might be the albumin-corrected delta creatinine itself since the term is not standard. But if the question is asking for the albumin-corrected delta ratio relative to the baseline creatinine: Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio = (Albumin-corrected Delta Creatinine) / Baseline Creatinine Baseline Creatinine = 1.15 mg/dL Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio = 9.83 / 1.15 ≈ 8.55 But this seems quite high and might not be the intended answer. Let's try another approach: the albumin-corrected creatinine for the current creatinine and the baseline creatinine and then calculate the delta between them. Corrected Current Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) ≈ 10.48 * 1.05263 ≈ 10.99 mg/dL Corrected Baseline Creatinine = 1.15 * (4.0 / 3.8) ≈ 1.15 * 1.05263 ≈ 1.21 mg/dL Now, the albumin-corrected delta creatinine is: Albumin-corrected Delta Creatinine = Corrected Current Creatinine - Corrected Baseline Creatinine = 10.99 - 1.21 ≈ 9.78 mg/dL And the albumin-corrected delta ratio relative to the baseline corrected creatinine is: Albumin-corrected Delta Ratio = Albumin-corrected Delta Creatinine / Corrected Baseline Creatinine = 9.78 / 1.21 ≈ 8.08 So the albumin-corrected delta ratio is approximately 8.08. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta ratio, we first need to find the change in creatinine (delta creatinine) between the current creatinine level and the baseline creatinine level. The current creatinine is 10.48 mg/dL, and the baseline creatinine from 3 years ago is 1.15 mg/dL. The delta creatinine is thus 10.48 - 1.15 = 9.33 mg/dL. Next, we need to correct this delta for the patient's albumin level. The patient's albumin is 3.8 g/dL, and the normal albumin is typically around 4.0 g/dL. The formula to correct the creatinine for albumin is: Corrected Creatinine = Measured Creatinine * (Normal Albumin / Patient Albumin). We will apply this correction to the delta creatinine. The albumin-corrected delta creatinine is therefore 9.33 * (4.0 / 3.8) ≈ 9.83 mg/dL. To find the albumin-corrected delta ratio, we divide this corrected delta creatinine by the baseline creatinine (uncorrected). So the albumin-corrected delta ratio is 9.83 / 1.15 ≈ 8.55. Alternatively, we can calculate the albumin-corrected creatinine for both the current and baseline creatinine levels and then find the delta between these corrected values. The corrected current creatinine is 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) ≈ 10.99 mg/dL, and the corrected baseline creatinine is 1.15 * (4.0 / 3.8) ≈ 1.21 mg/dL. The albumin-corrected delta creatinine is thus 10.99 - 1.21 ≈ 9.78 mg/dL. The albumin-corrected delta ratio relative to the corrected baseline creatinine is 9.78 / 1.21 ≈ 8.08. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is approximately 8.08.", "answer": "8.08"}

The FeverPAIN score includes the following components: - Fever - Pain - Airway - Inflammation - Neurologic Let's break down the patient's symptoms and findings to calculate the FeverPAIN score step-by-step. 1. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 39.6°C. This indicates a high fever. 2. **Pain**: The patient presents with symptoms such as drooling, inability to eat solids, and noisy breathing. These symptoms suggest discomfort and pain, likely related to the throat and possibly the neck. 3. **Airway**: The patient has loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness. These symptoms indicate some degree of airway compromise. 4. **Inflammation**: The patient has multiple enlarged lymph nodes (both anterior cervical lymph nodes and lymphadenopathy seen on imaging), white exudates on the tonsils, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (17.17 mg/dL), which indicates inflammation. 5. **Neurologic**: There is no mention of any neurologic symptoms or findings such as neck stiffness, altered mental status, or other neurological deficits. The patient is alert and the remainder of the physical findings is unremarkable. Now let's assign points for each component based on the FeverPAIN scoring system: - **Fever**: A temperature of 39.6°C is considered high. Typically, a fever above 38°C or 39°C is given points. Let's assume a high fever gets 1 point. - **Pain**: The patient has symptoms like drooling, inability to eat solids, and hoarseness, suggesting significant pain or discomfort. This would likely get 1 point. - **Airway**: The presence of loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness indicates some airway compromise. This would likely get 1 point. - **Inflammation**: The patient has multiple enlarged lymph nodes, white exudates on the tonsils, and an elevated CRP level. This indicates significant inflammation and would likely get 1 point. - **Neurologic**: There are no neurologic symptoms or findings. Therefore, this component gets 0 points. Now we sum up the points: - Fever: 1 point - Pain: 1 point - Airway: 1 point - Inflammation: 1 point - Neurologic: 0 points Total FeverPAIN score = 1 (Fever) + 1 (Pain) + 1 (Airway) + 1 (Inflammation) + 0 (Neurologic) = 4 points.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder. One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal.

AST 87, ALT 104.</think> Let's calculate step by step: 1. Age = 3.5 years (approximate age at the time of the current labs) 2. AST = 87 IU/L (current AST) 3. Platelet count = 101000 / μL (earlier platelet count, since the current platelet count is not given directly) 4. ALT = 104 IU/L (current ALT) Now, plug these values into the FIB-4 formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{\text{(Age)} \times \text{AST}}{\text{Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}}} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3.5) \times 87}{101000 \times \sqrt{104}} \] Calculate $\sqrt{104}$: \[ \sqrt{104} \approx 10.2 \] Now plug this into the formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3.5) \times 87}{101000 \times 10.2} \] Calculate the numerator: \[ (3.5) \times 87 = 304.5 \] Calculate the denominator: \[ 101000 \times 10.2 = 1030200 \] Now divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{304.5}{1030200} \approx 0.0002956 \] This result seems very small and likely incorrect because the FIB-4 index is typically used for adults and the age is very young. Let's try another approach: use the age at the time of the liver biopsy when more data was available. From the text: "One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L." And before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L. Let's use the data from the time of the liver biopsy. At the time of the liver biopsy: - Age = 3 years (since it's one year after the initial presentation at 2 years old) - AST = 677 IU/L - ALT = 1094 IU/L - Platelet count = 101000 / μL (from before the biopsy) Now, calculate the FIB-4 index using these values: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{\text{(Age)} \times \text{AST}}{\text{Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}}} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3) \times 677}{101000 \times \sqrt{1094}} \] Calculate $\sqrt{1094}$: \[ \sqrt{1094} \approx 33.07 \] Now plug this into the formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3) \times 677}{101000 \times 33.07} \] Calculate the numerator: \[ (3) \times 677 = 2031 \] Calculate the denominator: \[ 101000 \times 33.07 \approx 3340070 \] Now divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{2031}{3340070} \approx 0.000608 \] This is still very small and likely incorrect due to the young age. Let's use the data from the time when the AST and ALT were 194 IU/L and 424 IU/L respectively, one month after the high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone. Age = 3 years AST = 194 IU/L ALT = 424 IU/L Platelet count = 101000 / μL Now, calculate the FIB-4 index using these values: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3) \times 194}{101000 \times \sqrt{424}} \] Calculate $\sqrt{424}$: \[ \sqrt{424} \approx 20.6 \] Now plug this into the formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{(3) \times 194}{101000 \times 20.6} \] Calculate the numerator: \[ (3) \times 194 = 582 \] Calculate the denominator: \[ 101000 \times 20.6 \approx 2080600 \] Now divide the numerator by the denominator: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{582}{2080600} \approx 0.00028 \] This is also very small. It seems that the FIB-4 index is not appropriate for this young patient due to the very young age. Thus, the FIB-4 index is not meaningful for this patient due to her young age. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FIB-4 index, we need the formula: (Age * AST) / (Platelet count * sqrt(ALT)).

 Here is the patient note:
A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range. The plan is to continue monitoring her closely and to adjust her therapies as needed based on the comprehensive assessment of her case.

Step 1: Identify each component of the HAS-BLED score and assign points based on the patient's information. HAS-BLED stands for: - H: Hypertension - A: Abnormal Renal Function or Liver Function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding or predisposition to bleeding - L: Labile INR - E: Elderly (Age > 65 years) - D: Drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents) Now let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has a documented history of hypertension. This gives 1 point. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal Function or Liver Function** - The patient has a kidney transplant (indicating abnormal renal function) and suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis (indicating abnormal liver function). This gives 1 point for abnormal renal function and 1 point for abnormal liver function. However, the HAS-BLED score typically assigns 1 point if either abnormal renal function or liver function is present. Since the HAS-BLED score considers either abnormal renal function or liver function as one criterion, we will give 1 point for this criterion because the presence of either condition qualifies for the point. So, 1 point. 3. **S: Stroke** - The patient had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) last year. A TIA is considered a stroke-like event and can be counted here. This gives 1 point. 4. **B: Bleeding or predisposition to bleeding** - The patient denies any history of a major bleeding episode and has no known coagulation disorders. The coagulation studies show a stable INR and normal hemoglobin levels. Therefore, there is no evidence of a bleeding history or predisposition to bleeding. This gives 0 points. 5. **L: Labile INR** - The patient has a stable INR. This means the INR is not labile (unstable). Therefore, this gives 0 points. 6. **E: Elderly (Age > 65 years)** - The patient is 22 years old, which is not elderly. This gives 0 points. 7. **D: Drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents)** - The patient denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. Therefore, this gives 0 points. Now let's sum up the points: - H (Hypertension): 1 point - A (Abnormal Renal Function or Liver Function): 1 point - S (Stroke): 1 point - B (Bleeding or predisposition to bleeding): 0 points - L (Labile INR): 0 points - E (Elderly): 0 points - D (Drugs): 0 points Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3 points. Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we evaluate each component based on the provided patient information.\n\n1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has hypertension. This gives 1 point.\n2. **A: Abnormal Renal Function or Liver Function** - The patient has both a kidney transplant (indicating abnormal renal function) and suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis (indicating abnormal liver function). According to the HAS-BLED scoring system, the presence of either abnormal renal function or liver function counts for 1 point. Therefore, this gives 1 point.\n3. **S: Stroke** - The patient had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is considered a stroke-like event. This gives 1 point.\n4. **B: Bleeding or predisposition to bleeding** - The patient denies any history of a major bleeding episode and has no known coagulation disorders.

Therefore, this gives 0 points.\n\nNow, sum up the points: 1 (Hypertension) + 1 (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function) + 1 (Stroke) + 0 (Bleeding) + 0 (Labile INR) + 0 (Elderly) + 0 (Drugs) = 3 points.\n\nThus, the HAS-BLED score is 3.", "answer": "3"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.

Height 1.45 m. Square: 2.1025.</think> To calculate the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}}. \] Given: - The target BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2. - The height is 145 cm, which converts to 1.45 m. We need to find the target weight (W) in kg. Rearranging the BMI formula to solve for weight gives us: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2. \] Now, let's plug in the given values: 1. Calculate the square of the height: \[ \text{(Height)}^2 = (1.45)^2 = 2.1025 \, \text{m}^2. \] 2. Multiply this result by the target BMI: \[ \text{Weight} = 18.5 \times 2.1025. \] Now, perform the multiplication: \[ 18.5 \times 2.1025 = 38.94625. \] So, the target weight is approximately 38.94625 kg. Rounding to a reasonable precision (typically to one decimal place), it is about 38.9 kg. Thus, the patient's target weight is approximately 38.9 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: \[ \text{BMI} = \\frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}}. \] Given the target BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2 and the height is 145 cm (which is 1.45 m), we rearrange the formula to solve for weight: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2. \] First, calculate the square of the height: \[ (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. \] Next, multiply this result by the target BMI: \[ \text{Weight} = 18.5 \times 2.1025. \] Performing the multiplication: \[ 18.5 \times 2.1025 = 38.94625. \] Therefore, the target weight is approximately 38.9 kg.", "answer": "38.9"} {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: \[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{Weight (kg)}}{\\text{(Height (m))^2}}. \\] Given the target BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2 and the height is 145 cm (which is 1.45 m), we rearrange the formula to solve for weight: \\[ \\text{Weight (kg)} = \\text{BMI} \\times (\\text{Height (m)})^2. \\] First, calculate the square of the height: \\[ (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. \\] Next, multiply this result by the target BMI: \\[ \\text{Weight} = 18.5 \\times 2.1025. \\] Performing the multiplication: \\[ 18.5 \\times 2.1025 = 38.94625. \\] Therefore, the target weight is approximately 38.9 kg.", "answer": "38.9"}

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 5.8 mEq/L) = 39.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 39.2 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

The Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is not the one I initially thought of. The correct formula for the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is actually not a common one, and the most commonly used formulas are the Bazett's, Fridericia's, and Framingham's formulas. However, if we are to use a formula that involves the heart rate and the QT interval, the most common one is Bazett's formula, which is: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where the RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds. The heart rate is given as 154 bpm. To convert this to the RR interval in seconds: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate}} = \frac{60}{154} \approx 0.3896 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we can use Bazett's formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3896}}. \] Let's calculate the square root of 0.3896: \[ \sqrt{0.3896} \approx 0.6242. \] Now we can plug this into the formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6242} \approx 528.7. \] So the corrected QT interval using Bazett's formula is approximately 529 msec. However, since the task specifically mentions the "Hodges Formula," and if we assume that there might be some confusion and that the task might be referring to a less common formula or a misremembered formula, let's try another approach. The Hodges formula is not widely known, but one possible formula that could be referred to as a "Hodges formula" is: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60). \] Let's use this formula to calculate the corrected QT interval. Given: - QT = 330 msec - HR = 154 bpm Using the formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 1.75 \times (154 - 60). \] First, calculate \(154 - 60\): \[ 154 - 60 = 94. \] Now multiply this by 1.75: \[ 1.75 \times 94 = 164.5. \] Now add this result to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 164.5 = 494.5. \] So the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is approximately 494.5 msec. Since the task specifies the use of the Hodges formula and we have calculated it using the formula \( \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60), \) the answer is 494.5 msec. Thus, the final answer is 495 msec when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the given values: QT = 330 msec and HR = 154 bpm. 2. Use the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval, which is \( \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60). \) 3. Calculate \( \text{HR} - 60 = 154 - 60 = 94. \) 4. Multiply this result by 1.75: \( 1.75 \times 94 = 164.5. \) 5. Add this result to the QT interval: \( 330 + 164.5 = 494.5. \) Thus, the corrected QT interval is approximately 494.5 msec. The final answer is 495 msec when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula, we use the formula: QTc_Hodges = QT + 1.75 * (HR - 60).

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.

He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.\nConcurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

But delta gap negative? maybe use later values: bicarbonate 22, Na 134, Cl 104.</think> Let's calculate the anion gap for both sets of values and then find the delta gap. Step 1: Calculate the anion gap for the initial set of values from the local hospital (at the time of presentation to the emergency department): The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). Using the values from the initial renal function tests at the local hospital: - Sodium = 141 mEq/L - Chloride = 104 mEq/L - Bicarbonate = 29 mEq/L Anion Gap = 141 - (104 + 29) = 141 - 133 = 8 mEq/L. Step 2: Calculate the anion gap for the values upon admission to the Children's Hospital: Using the values upon admission to the Children's Hospital: - Sodium = 134 mEq/L - Chloride = 104 mEq/L - Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L Anion Gap = 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. Now, let's calculate the delta gap. The delta gap is defined as the difference between the anion gap and the serum sodium minus the serum chloride minus 24. The formula for the delta gap is: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - [(Serum Na - Serum Cl) - 24]. Let's calculate the delta gap for the values upon admission to the Children's Hospital: Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L (from the calculation above). Now, calculate (Serum Na - Serum Cl) for the values upon admission to the Children's Hospital: - Sodium = 134 mEq/L - Chloride = 104 mEq/L So, Serum Na - Serum Cl = 134 - 104 = 30 mEq/L. Now, we plug these into the delta gap formula: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - [(Serum Na - Serum Cl) - 24]. Using the Anion Gap = 8 mEq/L and (Serum Na - Serum Cl) = 30 mEq/L: Delta Gap = (8 - 12) - [30 - 24] = -4 - 6 = -10 mEq/L. Thus, the patient's delta gap is -10 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, we need to use the formula: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - [(Serum Na - Serum Cl) - 24].

Using the values: Sodium = 134 mEq/L, Chloride = 104 mEq/L, and Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L, the anion gap is 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. Next, we calculate (Serum Na - Serum Cl): 134 - 104 = 30 mEq/L. Now we plug these values into the delta gap formula: Delta Gap = (8 - 12) - [30 - 24] = -4 - 6 = -10 mEq/L.", "answer": "-10"}

Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.", 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '-32', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need delta gap: (Bicarbonate - 24) - (Serum Na - Serum Cl).\nUse admission values? likely at presentation: bicarbonate 29, Na 141, Cl 104.\nBut delta gap negative? maybe use later values: bicarbonate 22, Na 134, Cl 104.', 'LLM Explanation': 'To calculate the delta gap we use the formula: \\nDelta gap = (Bicarbonate – 24) – (Serum Na – Serum Cl). \\nUsing the laboratory values from the admission to the Children’s Hospital (the most recent values before discharge):\\n- Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L\\n- Serum Na = 134 mEq/L\\n- Serum Cl = 104 mEq/L\\n\\nCompute each part:\\n- (Bicarbonate – 24) = 22 – 24 = –2\\n- (Serum Na – Serum Cl) = 134 – 104 = 30\\n\\nDelta gap = –2 – 30 = –32 mEq/L.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '-10', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the delta gap, we need to use the formula: Delta Gap = (Anion Gap - 12) - [(Serum Na - Serum Cl) - 24]. First, we calculate the anion gap using the values from the admission to the Children's Hospital. The anion gap is given by Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). Using the values: Sodium = 134 mEq/L, Chloride = 104 mEq/L, and Bicarbonate = 22 mEq/L, the anion gap is 134 - (104 + 22) = 134 - 126 = 8 mEq/L. Next, we calculate (Serum Na - Serum Cl): 134 - 104 = 30 mEq/L. Now we plug these values into the delta gap formula: Delta Gap = (8 - 12) - [30 - 24] = -4 - 6 = -10 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '-4', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

So, this criterion is not met. Step 2: Check for Urea > 7 mmol/L (or >20 mg/dL). The patient's urea nitrogen level is 14 mg/dL. Since 14 mg/dL < 20 mg/dL, this criterion is not met. Step 3: Check for Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min. The patient's respiratory rate is 16/min. Since 16 < 30, this criterion is not met. Step 4: Check for Blood pressure (systolic <90 mm Hg or diastolic ≤ 60 mm Hg). The patient's blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Since the systolic is 150 mm Hg (which is >90 mm Hg) and the diastolic is 85 mm Hg (which is >60 mm Hg), this criterion is not met. Step 5: Check if the patient is aged ≥ 65 years. The patient is 62 years old, which is less than 65. So, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the number of criteria that were met: - Confusion: No - Urea > 7 mmol/L (or >20 mg/dL): No - Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min: No - Blood pressure low (systolic <90 mm Hg or diastolic ≤ 60 mm Hg): No - Age ≥ 65 years: No None of the criteria are met.

But maybe sore throat counts? No.</think> Let's break it down step by step: 1. The Centor Score is used to assess the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis. It includes the following criteria: - Tonsillar exudates - Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy - Temperature > 38.0°C (100.4°F) - Absence of cough 2. Let's evaluate each criterion for the given patient: - **Tonsillar Exudates**: The note mentions "an erythematous oropharynx." While this indicates inflammation, it does not specifically mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy**: The note mentions "posterior cervical lymphadenopathy." The Centor Score requires "tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy." Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is different from anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Temperature > 38.0°C (100.4°F)**: The patient's temperature is 100.8°F, which converts to approximately 38.2°C. The Centor Score requires a temperature > 38.0°C. Since 38.2°C is greater than 38.0°C, this criterion is met. - **Absence of Cough**: The note does not mention the presence of a cough. Therefore, we can assume the absence of cough, and this criterion is met. Now let's count the number of criteria met: - Tonsillar Exudates: No - Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: No - Temperature > 38.0°C: Yes - Absence of Cough: Yes So, the patient meets 2 out of the 4 criteria. Therefore, the Centor Score is 2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the following criteria: tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever > 38.0°C, and absence of cough. Let's go through each one for the given patient: 1. **Tonsillar Exudates**: The note mentions an "erythematous oropharynx," but it doesn't specifically mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy**: The note mentions "posterior cervical lymphadenopathy." The Centor Score requires "tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy." Since it's posterior and not specified as tender, this criterion is not met. 3. **Temperature > 38.0°C**: The patient's temperature is 100.8°F, which converts to approximately 38.2°C. Since 38.2°C is greater than 38.0°C, this criterion is met. 4. **Absence of Cough**: The note does not mention the presence of a cough. Therefore, we can assume the absence of cough, and this criterion is met. Thus, the patient meets 2 out of the 4 criteria (fever > 38.0°C and absence of cough). Therefore, the Centor Score is 2.", "answer": "2"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

Heart rate < 100: The patient's heart rate is 114 beats per minute. This criterion is not met. 3. Oxygen saturation >= 95%: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. This implies that the oxygen saturation was below 90% without oxygen supplementation. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 4. No hemoptysis: The patient note does not mention hemoptysis. So, we can assume this criterion is met (no hemoptysis). 5. No unilateral leg swelling: The patient note does not mention any leg swelling. So, this criterion is met (no unilateral leg swelling). 6. No prior VTE (venous thromboembolism): The patient note does not mention any history of VTE. So, this criterion is met (no prior VTE). 7. No estrogen use: The patient note does not mention estrogen use. So, this criterion is met (no estrogen use). 8. No surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks: The patient note does not mention any recent surgery or trauma. So, this criterion is met (no surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks). Now let's count the number of criteria met: - Age < 50: Not met. - Heart rate < 100: Not met. - Oxygen saturation >= 95%: Not met. - No hemoptysis: Met. - No unilateral leg swelling: Met. - No prior VTE: Met. - No estrogen use: Met. - No surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks: Met. So, out of the 8 criteria, the patient meets 4 criteria (no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, no prior VTE, no estrogen use, no surgery or trauma in the past 4 weeks).

In the first phase, you get him to lift up a 2.3 kg (5 lb) weight off a table with his left hand. In the second phase, you get him to do 20 burpees, taking his heart rate to 150/min. In the third phase, you electrically stimulate his gastrocnemius with a frequency of 50 Hz. You are interested in the tension and electrical activity of specific muscles as follows: Biceps in phase 1, cardiac muscle in phase 2, and gastrocnemius in phase 3.

Let's assume weight 22 kg.</think> If the patient weighs 22 kg: 1. Calculate maintenance fluid for a child using the formula for children: - First 10 kg: 4 mL/kg/hr - Next 10 kg: 2 mL/kg/hr - Each kg above 20 kg: 1 mL/kg/hr For a 22 kg child: - First 10 kg: 10 kg * 4 mL/kg/hr = 40 mL/hr - Next 10 kg: 10 kg * 2 mL/kg/hr = 20 mL/hr - Remaining 2 kg (since 22 - 20 = 2 kg): 2 kg * 1 mL/kg/hr = 2 mL/hr Add them up: 40 mL/hr + 20 mL/hr + 2 mL/hr = 62 mL/hr So if the patient weighs 22 kg, the maintenance fluid is 62 mL/hr. But if the patient is a 22-year-old male, it's more likely that the weight is not 22 kg. Let's assume a typical weight for a 22-year-old male, say 70 kg. For an adult, the maintenance fluid is typically calculated using the formula: - 30-40 mL/kg/day for the first 10 kg - 20 mL/kg/day for the next 10 kg - 10 mL/kg/day for each kg above 20 kg But for simplicity, we often use a simpler rule of thumb for adults: 1 mL/kg/hr. If the patient weighs 70 kg: Maintenance fluid = 70 kg * 1 mL/kg/hr = 70 mL/hr. Since the weight is not provided in the note, I'll assume the patient is a typical 22-year-old male and use a weight of 70 kg. So the maintenance fluid for a 70 kg adult is 70 mL/hr. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the maintenance fluid for the patient, we need the patient's weight.

A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

In the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), this corresponds to: - 4: Opens eyes to verbal command - 3: Opens eyes to pain Since the patient opened his eyes to a sternal rub (which is a painful stimulus), the score for Eye Opening is 3. Step 2: Evaluate Verbal Response (V) The patient was "nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests." This indicates that the patient did not make any sounds or respond verbally. In the GCS, this corresponds to: - 5: Oriented - 4: Confused - 3: Inappropriate words - 2: Incomprehensible sounds - 1: None Since the patient was nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests, the score for Verbal Response is 1. Step 3: Evaluate Motor Response (M) The patient's limbs "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement." This suggests an abnormal motor response. In the GCS, the motor responses are: - 6: Obeys commands - 5: Localizes to pain - 4: Withdraws from pain - 3: Abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing) - 2: Extension (decerebrate posturing) - 1: No response The description of "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement" suggests decerebrate posturing, which corresponds to a score of 2. Now we add up the scores: - Eye Opening (E): 3 - Verbal Response (V): 1 - Motor Response (M): 2 The total GCS score is \( E + V + M = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 \). So the patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 6. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate three components: Eye Opening, Verbal Response, and Motor Response.\n\n1. **Eye Opening (E):** The patient \"slightly opened his eyes\" in response to a sternal rub. A sternal rub is a painful stimulus. According to the GCS, opening eyes to pain corresponds to a score of 3.\n\n2. **Verbal Response (V):** The patient was described as \"nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests.\" This indicates no verbal response at all, which corresponds to a score of 1 in the GCS.\n\n3. **Motor Response (M):** The patient's limbs \"hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement.\" This description suggests decerebrate posturing (extension), which corresponds to a score of 2 in the GCS.\n\nNow we sum up the scores from each component:\n- Eye Opening (E) = 3\n- Verbal Response (V) = 1\n- Motor Response (M) = 2\n\nThe total GCS score is \(3 + 1 + 2 = 6\).", "answer": "6"}

Actually Caprini: Major surgery = 2, Minor surgery = 1. Trauma = 2. Also immobilization >3 days = 1. BMI 27.1 (BMI 25-29.9 = 1). Varicose veins = 1. Also maybe "history of prior DVT" already counted.</think> Let's calculate step by step: 1. **Age**: The patient is 63 years old. According to the Caprini score, for age 61-74, the score is 1 point. 2. **Surgery or Trauma**: The patient sustained multiple traumas in a motor vehicle collision, including a left femoral shaft fracture. This qualifies as a major trauma. The Caprini score assigns 2 points for major trauma or surgery. 3. **Immobility**: The patient is confined to bed due to her injuries. Immobilization for more than 3 days is part of the rehabilitation process. This gives 1 point. 4. **Malignancy**: No history of malignancy. 0 points. 5. **Heart Failure or Respiratory Failure**: No history of heart failure or respiratory failure. 0 points. 6. **Varicose Veins**: The patient has varicose veins bilaterally. This gives 1 point. 7. **Obesity**: The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2, which falls within the range of 25-29.9. This gives 1 point. 8. **Prior VTE (Venous Thromboembolism)**: The patient has a history of prior DVT. This gives 3 points. 9. **Cancer Treatment within 1 month**: No history of cancer treatment within the last month. 0 points. 10. **Paralysis**: No paralysis. 0 points. 11. **Congestive Heart Failure**: No history of congestive heart failure. 0 points. 12. **Respiratory Failure**: No respiratory failure. 0 points. Now let's add up all the points: - Age 61-74: 1 point - Major trauma/surgery: 2 points - Immobilization > 3 days: 1 point - Varicose veins: 1 point - Obesity (BMI 25-29.9): 1 point - Prior DVT: 3 points Adding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9 points. So the Caprini score for this patient is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Caprini score for the patient, we will evaluate each criterion and assign points accordingly.\n\n1. **Age**: The patient is 63 years old.

The correct formula for the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is actually not a common one. It seems there might be some confusion. Let's use the Bazett's formula, which is one of the most common formulas for correcting the QT interval. The Bazett's formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where the RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate (HR). The heart rate is given in beats per minute (bpm), and the RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG, typically measured in seconds. To convert the heart rate to the RR interval: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}}. \] Given the heart rate (HR) is 161 bpm, we can calculate the RR interval as: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{161} \approx 0.3727 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now, we use the Bazett's formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3727}}. \] Let's calculate the square root of 0.3727: \[ \sqrt{0.3727} \approx 0.6105. \] Now, we can calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6105} \approx 540.6. \] So the corrected QT interval using Bazett's formula is approximately 541 msec. However, since the task seems to ask for the Hodges formula and I initially got confused, let's clarify the Hodges formula. The Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60). \] Given: - QT = 330 msec, - HR = 161 bpm. Let's plug these values into the Hodges formula. \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 1.75 \times (161 - 60). \] Calculate \(161 - 60\): \[ 161 - 60 = 101. \] Now multiply this by 1.75: \[ 1.75 \times 101 = 176.75. \] Add this result to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Hodges} = 330 + 176.75 = 506.75. \] Rounded to the nearest whole number, the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is approximately 507 msec. So the final answer is 507 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula, we use the formula: \n\[ \\text{QTc}_\\text{Hodges} = \\text{QT} + 1.75 \\times (\\text{HR} - 60). \]\nGiven the values from the patient note:\n- QT = 330 msec,\n- HR = 161 bpm.\n\nStep 1: Calculate \( \\text{HR} - 60 \).\n\[ 161 - 60 = 101. \]\n\nStep 2: Multiply this result by 1.75.\n\[ 1.75 \\times 101 = 176.75. \]\n\nStep 3: Add this product to the QT interval.\n\[ \\text{QTc}_\\text{Hodges} = 330 + 176.75 = 506.75. \]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 507 msec.", "answer": "507"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation. The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function. Here is the task: What is the patient's FeverPAIN score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think>Need FeverPAIN score: components: Fever (temp >38), Ear pain?

Earache? not mentioned Age 28 age < 12? no No cough? He had cough during choking but not current cough. >3 days?</think> Let's calculate the FeverPAIN score step by step for this patient. Step 1: Identify the components of the FeverPAIN score: - Fever (temperature > 38°C) - Pain (severe neck pain with painful swallowing) - Earache (not mentioned) - Age (28 years old) - No cough (no current cough mentioned) - Duration > 3 days (symptoms for 5 days) Step 2: Evaluate each component: 1. **Fever**: The patient has a low-grade fever. A low-grade fever typically means a temperature above normal but below 38°C. Since the fever is described as "low-grade," it likely does not meet the threshold of >38°C. Therefore, this component is 0. 2. **Pain**: The patient has severe neck pain and painful swallowing. This indicates significant pain. So, this component is 1. 3. **Earache**: There is no mention of earache. Therefore, this component is 0. 4. **Age**: The patient is 28 years old. Since the age is not less than 12, this component is 0. 5. **No cough**: The patient does not have a current cough. He had a cough during the choking incident but no current cough is mentioned. Therefore, this component is 1. 6. **Duration > 3 days**: The symptoms have been present for 5 days, which is more than 3 days. Therefore, this component is 1. Now, let's sum up the scores for the components that are applicable to the FeverPAIN score for sore throat: - Fever (temperature > 38°C): 0 - Pain (severe neck pain with painful swallowing): 1 - Earache: 0 - Age < 12: 0 - No cough: 1 - >3 days: 1 Adding these up: 0 (Fever) + 1 (Pain) + 0 (Earache) + 0 (Age < 12) + 1 (No cough) + 1 (>3 days) = 3. So the FeverPAIN score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components: Fever (temperature > 38°C), Pain, Earache, Age < 12, No cough, and >3 days.\n\n1. **Fever**: The patient has a low-grade fever, which typically means a temperature above normal but below 38°C.

From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: - Days from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 18 = 13 days. 2. Now, we count the total number of days in each month from August 2010 through January 2011, and add the days from February 1 to February 9, 2011. - August 2010 has 31 days. - September 2010 has 30 days. - October 2010 has 31 days. - November 2010 has 30 days. - December 2010 has 31 days. - January 2011 has 31 days. - And from February 1 to February 9, 2011, there are 9 days. Now, let's add all these up: - Days from July 18 to July 31, 2010: 13 days. - August 2010: 31 days. - September 2010: 30 days. - October 2010: 31 days. - November 2010: 30 days. - December 2010: 31 days. - January 2011: 31 days. - February 1 to February 9, 2011: 9 days. Adding them together: \[ 13 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 9 \] Let's do the math step by step: \[ 13 + 31 = 44 \] \[ 44 + 30 = 74 \] \[ 74 + 31 = 105 \] \[ 105 + 30 = 135 \] \[ 135 + 31 = 166 \] \[ 166 + 31 = 197 \] \[ 197 + 9 = 206 \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 206 days. To convert this into weeks and days, we divide the total number of days (206) by 7 to get the number of weeks and the remainder will give us the number of days. \[ 206 \div 7 = 29 \text{ weeks with a remainder of } 3 \text{ days.} \] So, 206 days is equal to 29 weeks and 3 days. Therefore, the estimated gestational age is (29 weeks, 3 days). The final answer is (29 weeks, 3 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP), which is July 18, 2010, and today's date, which is February 9, 2011. \n\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL.

Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

So the total SOFA score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Hematological, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and Neurological. Let's break this down step by step. 1. **Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂):** - PaO₂ = 77 mm Hg - FiO₂ = 54% = 0.54 - PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio = 77 / 0.54 ≈ 142.6 - According to the SOFA scoring for the respiratory system: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: 0 points - 300-400: 1 point - 200-300: 2 points - 100-200: 3 points - <100: 4 points - Since 100 < 142.6 < 200, the score is 2 points. (Correction: It should be between 200-300 for 2 points and 100-200 for 3 points. Let's check the correct range.) - Correctly, since 142.6 falls between 100 and 200, the score is 3 points. 2. **Hematological (Platelets):** - Platelets = 180,000/µL - According to the SOFA scoring for the hematological system: - Platelets >= 150,000: 0 points - 100,000-149,999: 1 point - 50,000-99,999: 2 points - <50,000: 4 points - Since the platelet count is 180,000, which is >= 150,000, the score is 0 points. 3. **Liver (Bilirubin):** - Bilirubin = 1.7 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the liver system: - Bilirubin < 2: 0 points - 2-6.9: 1 point - 7-11.9: 2 points - >= 12: 3 points - Since 1.7 mg/dL is less than 2, the score is 0 points. (Correction: The given range for the score is incorrect. Let's use the correct ranges.) - Correctly, the ranges should be: - Bilirubin < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2 - 1.9: 1 point - 2 - 5.9: 2 points - >= 6: 3 points - Since the bilirubin level is 1.7 mg/dL, which falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, the score is 1 point. 4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Support):** - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) = 2/3 * Diastolic + 1/3 * Systolic = 2/3 * 80 + 1/3 * 120 = 160/3 + 40 = 53.3 + 40 = 93.3 mm Hg. - The patient is on vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min respectively, and norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. - To calculate the SOFA score for the cardiovascular system, we need to consider both the MAP and the type and dose of vasopressors used. - According to the SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system: - If MAP >= 70 and no vasopressors: 0 points - If MAP >= 70 and vasopressors are used: - If the vasopressor requirement is such that the dose is equivalent to dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or any equivalent vasopressor: 1 point - If the vasopressor requirement is such that the dose is dopamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 2 points - If the vasopressor requirement is such that the dose is dopamine > 15 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine >= 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 3 points - If MAP < 70: 4 points Let's calculate the equivalent vasopressor dose. - DOPamine 4 mcg/kg/min - DOBUTamine 3.5 mcg/kg/min (Note: Dobutamine is not typically used for vasopressor support; it is primarily used for inotropy. We will consider its contribution to the vasopressor score if it has any.) - norEPINEPHrine 0.07 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min The total vasopressor load can be calculated by summing up the equivalent doses of the vasopressors. For simplicity, we will use the following equivalences: - Dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min: 0 points - Dopamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min: 1 point - Dopamine > 15 mcg/kg/min: 2 points - Norepinephrine < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 1 point - Norepinephrine >= 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 2 points Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, we need to sum up their effects. - DOPamine 4 mcg/kg/min: This is less than 5 mcg/kg/min, so it contributes minimally to the vasopressor score. - DOBUTamine 3.5 mcg/kg/min: Dobutamine is primarily an inotrope and has minimal pressor effect, so we will consider it negligible for the vasopressor score. - norEPINEPHrine 0.07 mcg/kg/min: This is less than 0.1 mcg/kg/min, so it contributes 1 point if considered alone. - EPINEPHrine 0.03 mcg/kg/min: This is also a vasopressor. The combined effect of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine needs to be considered. Let's add the doses of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine: - Total vasopressor dose from norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine = 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Since the total vasopressor dose from norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine is 0.1 mcg/kg/min, this falls into the category of norepinephrine >= 0.1 mcg/kg/min, which corresponds to a score of 2 points. Since the MAP is 93.3 mm Hg (which is > 70), and the patient is on vasopressors, we need to determine the appropriate score based on the vasopressor dose. Given that the total vasopressor dose (primarily from norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine) is 0.1 mcg/kg/min, this corresponds to a score of 2 points for the cardiovascular component. 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the renal system: - Creatinine < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2 - 1.9: 1 point - 2 - 3.4: 2 points - > 3.4: 3 points - Since the creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, the score is 1 point. 6. **Neurological (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)):** - GCS = 13 - According to the SOFA scoring for the neurological system: - GCS 15: 0 points - 14: 1 point - 13: 2 points - 12: 3 points - 9-11: 4 points - <9: 5 points - Since the GCS is 13, the score is 2 points. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂): 3 points - Hematological (Platelets): 0 points - Liver (Bilirubin): 1 point - Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressors): 2 points - Renal (Creatinine): 1 point - Neurological (GCS): 2 points Adding these up: 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 points. So the total SOFA score is 9.

To calculate the SOFA score for the cardiovascular system, we need to consider both the MAP and the type and dose of vasopressors used. - Since MAP is 93.3 mm Hg, which is > 70 mm Hg, we need to look at the vasopressor requirement. The scoring for vasopressors is as follows: - If MAP >= 70 and no vasopressors: 0 points - If MAP >= 70 and vasopressors are used: - Dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or equivalent: 1 point - Dopamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine < 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 2 points - Dopamine > 15 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine >= 0.1 mcg/kg/min: 3 points Let's evaluate the vasopressor doses: - DOPamine: 4 mcg/kg/min (This is < 5 mcg/kg/min.) - DOBUTamine: 3.5 mcg/kg/min (This is an inotrope and has minimal pressor effect.) - norEPINEPHrine: 0.07 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine: 0.03 mcg/kg/min The combined dose of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine is 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Since the combined dose of norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine is 0.1 mcg/kg/min, this falls into the category of norepinephrine >= 0.1 mcg/kg/min, which corresponds to a score of 3 points for the vasopressor use. Therefore, the cardiovascular score is 3 points because the patient is on vasopressors with a combined dose that exceeds the threshold for a higher score. 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the renal system: - Creatinine < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2 - 1.9: 1 point - 2 - 3.4: 2 points - > 3.4: 3 points - Since the creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, the score is 1 point. 6. **Neurological (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)):** - GCS = 13 - According to the SOFA scoring for the neurological system: - GCS 15: 0 points - 14: 1 point - 13: 2 points - 12: 3 points - 9-11: 4 points - <9: 5 points - Since the GCS is 13, the score is 2 points.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

This criterion is met. 2. **Tonsillar Exudates**: The note mentions "Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall." While this indicates some inflammation in the pharyngeal area, it does not explicitly mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, we cannot confirm this criterion is met. 3. **Absence of Cough**: The patient presented with a cough. Therefore, this criterion is NOT met. 4. **Tender Anterior Cervical Lymph Nodes**: There is no mention of tender anterior cervical lymph nodes in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot confirm this criterion is met. So, the criteria that are met: - Fever (Yes) - Tonsillar Exudates (No, not explicitly mentioned) - Absence of Cough (No, the patient has a cough) - Tender Anterior Cervical Lymph Nodes (No, not mentioned) Since the patient has a fever but has a cough and there is no mention of tonsillar exudates or tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, the Centor Score is: - Fever: +1 - Tonsillar Exudates: 0 - Absence of Cough: 0 - Tender Anterior Cervical Lymph Nodes: 0 Total Centor Score = 1 Thus, the patient's Centor Score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the following criteria: fever, tonsillar exudates, absence of cough, and tender anterior cervical lymph nodes.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command. Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment. Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L. Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered. Here is the task: What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

Maybe they want delta gap = (Na - Cl - HCO3) - (Na - Cl - HCO3) baseline?</think> But since the baseline is not provided, I will calculate the anion gap and then the delta gap. The anion gap is calculated as: Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3). From the given lab values: - Na = 135 mmol/L - Cl = 103 mmol/L - HCO3 = 19 mmol/L Let's calculate the anion gap: Anion gap = 135 - (103 + 19) = 135 - 122 = 13 mEq/L. To calculate the delta gap, we need the formula: Delta gap = Anion gap - (Normal HCO3 - Measured HCO3). The normal HCO3 is typically around 24 mEq/L. So, the formula becomes: Delta gap = Anion gap - (24 - HCO3). Plugging in the values: Anion gap = 13 mEq/L HCO3 = 19 mEq/L Delta gap = 13 - (24 - 19) = 13 - 5 = 8 mEq/L. Thus the delta gap is 8 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta gap, we first need the anion gap and the HCO3 value. The anion gap is calculated as Na - (Cl + HCO3).

The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute.

For APACHE II, PaO2 < 60 => 3 points. Lab values: BUN? Not given.</think> <think>Let's calculate the APACHE II score step by step using the given information. Step 1: Age The patient is 73 years old. The age score is 1 point for 71-80 years. Step 2: Temperature The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2°C. The temperature is within the normal range (36-38°C), so the score is 0. Step 3: Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) To calculate MAP, we use the formula: MAP = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3. Given BP is 138/92 mmHg. MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = (184 + 138) / 3 = 322 / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. For MAP, the score is as follows: - MAP < 70 => 4 points - 70-79 => 3 points - 80-89 => 2 points - 90-109 => 0 points - 110-119 => 1 point - 120-129 => 2 points - 130-139 => 3 points - 140-149 => 4 points - 150-159 => 5 points - 160-169 => 6 points - 170-179 => 7 points - 180-189 => 8 points - 190+ => 9 points Since MAP is 107.3 mmHg, it falls within the range 90-109, so the score is 0. Step 4: Heart Rate The heart rate is 107 beats per minute. The heart rate score is as follows: - < 40 => 4 points - 40-49 => 3 points - 50-59 => 2 points - 60-109 => 0 points - 110-119 => 1 point - 120-129 => 2 points - 130-139 => 3 points - 140-149 => 4 points - 150-159 => 5 points - 160-169 => 6 points - 170-179 => 7 points - 180-189 => 8 points - 190+ => 9 points Since the heart rate is 107, it falls within the range 60-109, so the score is 0. Step 5: Respiratory Rate The respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. The respiratory rate score is as follows: - < 10 => 2 points - 10-14 => 1 point - 15-29 => 0 points - 30-39 => 1 point - 40-49 => 2 points - 50-59 => 3 points - 60-69 => 4 points - 70-79 => 5 points - 80-89 => 6 points - 90-99 => 7 points - 100-109 => 8 points - 110-119 => 9 points - 120+ => 10 points Since the respiratory rate is 35, it falls within the range 30-39, so the score is 1. Step 6: PaO2 The PaO2 is 78 mmHg. The PaO2 score is as follows: - PaO2 < 60 => 3 points - 60-79 => 2 points - 80-99 => 1 point - 100-199 => 0 points - 200-299 => 1 point - 300-399 => 2 points - 400-499 => 3 points - 500-599 => 4 points - 600-699 => 5 points - 700-799 => 6 points - 800-899 => 7 points - 900-999 => 8 points - 1000+ => 9 points Since PaO2 is 78 mmHg, it falls within the range < 60 to 79. Specifically, since it's 78, it falls within the range 60-79, so the score is 2. Step 7: pH The pH is 7.29. The pH score is as follows: - < 7.30 => 3 points - 7.30-7.34 => 2 points - 7.35-7.45 => 0 points - > 7.45 => 1 point Since the pH is 7.29, it falls within the range < 7.30, so the score is 3. Step 8: BUN The BUN is not provided directly. We need to calculate it from the creatinine level. The creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL. We can use the Cockcroft-Gault formula to estimate the creatinine clearance (CrCl), and then use that to estimate the BUN. The Cockcroft-Gault formula for estimating creatinine clearance is: CrCl = (140 - age) * weight (kg) / (72 * serum creatinine (mg/dL)) * 0.85 (if female). Since the patient is male and the weight is not provided, we will use the creatinine level directly to estimate the BUN. For the APACHE II score, the BUN score is based on the BUN level: - BUN < 10 => 0 points - 10-19 => 0 points - 20-39 => 1 point - 40-59 => 2 points - 60-79 => 3 points - 80-99 => 4 points - 100+ => 5 points Since BUN is not directly provided, we will assume an average BUN for a creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL. Typically, BUN and creatinine have a ratio of about 10:1 to 20:1. Let's assume a BUN:creatinine ratio of 15:1. So, BUN = 15 * creatinine = 15 * 4.58 = 68.7 mg/dL. Since BUN is approximately 68.7 mg/dL, it falls within the range 60-79, so the score is 3. Step 9: Serum Sodium The serum sodium is 143.21 mmol/L. The sodium score is as follows: - < 120 => 4 points - 120-129 => 3 points - 130-139 => 2 points - 140-159 => 0 points - 160-169 => 1 point - 170-179 => 2 points - 180-189 => 3 points - 190+ => 4 points Since the sodium level is 143.21 mmol/L, it falls within the range 140-159, so the score is 0. Step 10: Serum Potassium The serum potassium is 3.68 mmol/L. The potassium score is as follows: - < 3.0 => 3 points - 3.0-3.4 => 2 points - 3.5-5.4 => 0 points - 5.5-6.4 => 1 point - 6.5-7.4 => 2 points - 7.5-8.4 => 3 points - 8.5+ => 4 points Since the potassium level is 3.68 mmol/L, it falls within the range 3.5-5.4, so the score is 0. Step 11: Serum Creatinine The serum creatinine is 4.58 mg/dL. The creatinine score is as follows: - < 1.5 => 0 points - 1.5-1.9 => 1 point - 2.0-2.9 => 2 points - 3.0-3.9 => 3 points - 4.0-4.9 => 4 points - 5.0-5.9 => 5 points - 6.0-6.9 => 6 points - 7.0-7.9 => 7 points - 8.0-8.9 => 8 points - 9.0-9.9 => 9 points - 10.0+ => 10 points Since the creatinine level is 4.58 mg/dL, it falls within the range 4.0-4.9, so the score is 4. Step 12: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) The GCS is 15. The GCS score is as follows: - 15 => 0 points - 13-14 => 1 point - 10-12 => 2 points - 7-9 => 3 points - 4-6 => 4 points - 3 => 5 points - 2 => 6 points - 1 => 7 points Since the GCS is 15, the score is 0. Step 13: Urine Output The urine output is not provided, so we will assume it is not applicable or not given. Step 14: White Blood Cell Count (WBC) The WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL. The WBC score is as follows: - < 1000 => 4 points - 1000-2000 => 3 points - 2001-4000 => 2 points - 4001-10,000 => 0 points - 10,001-15,000 => 1 point - 15,001-20,000 => 2 points - 20,001-25,000 => 3 points - 25,001-30,000 => 4 points - 30,001-35,000 => 5 points - 35,001-40,000 => 6 points - 40,001-45,000 => 7 points - 45,001-50,000 => 8 points - 50,001-55,000 => 9 points - 55,001-60,000 => 10 points - 60,001+ => 11 points Since the WBC count is 15,105 cells/µL, it falls within the range 10,001-15,000, so the score is 1. Now, let's sum up all the scores: Age: 1 point Temperature: 0 points MAP: 0 points Heart Rate: 0 points Respiratory Rate: 1 point PaO2: 2 points pH: 3 points BUN: 3 points Serum Sodium: 0 points Serum Potassium: 0 points Serum Creatinine: 4 points GCS: 0 points WBC: 1 point Total APACHE II score = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 15.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '0', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need CHA2DS2-VASc: factors: Congestive heart failure (1), Hypertension (1), Age ≥75 (2), Diabetes (1), Stroke/TIA (2), Vascular disease (1), Age 65-74 (1), Sex category female (1).  \nPatient 55 male, no CHF, no HTN, no diabetes, no stroke, no vascular disease, age 55, male.', 'LLM Explanation': 'The CHA2DS2‑VASc score is calculated by adding points for the following risk factors: \\n• Congestive heart failure – 1 point\\n• Hypertension – 1 point\\n• Age ≥75 – 2 points\\n• Diabetes mellitus – 1 point\\n• Prior stroke/TIA/TE – 2 points\\n• Vascular disease (prior MI, PAD, aortic plaque) – 1 point\\n• Age 65–74 – 1 point\\n• Female sex – 1 point\\n\\nThe patient is a 55‑year‑old male with no history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, or other listed conditions.

Actually Child-Pugh: A 5-6, B 7-9, C 10-15.</think> Let's calculate step by step: Step 1: Determine the components for the Child-Pugh score. The Child-Pugh score includes the following parameters: - Encephalopathy - Ascites - Bilirubin - Albumin - Prothrombin time (INR) Step 2: Assign scores to each parameter. **Encephalopathy:** The patient is oriented only to self, which indicates some level of confusion. Given the presence of asterixis (a sign of hepatic encephalopathy), we can infer that the patient has some degree of hepatic encephalopathy. The grading for encephalopathy in the Child-Pugh score is as follows: - Grade 0: No encephalopathy - Grade 1: Trivial dysfunction (e.g., euphoria, anxiety, or distractibility) - Grade 2: Stupor or lethargy - Grade 3: Somnolence but responsive to stimuli - Grade 4: Coma Since the patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis, this suggests at least Grade 2 encephalopathy (stupor or lethargy). So, Encephalopathy = Grade 2. According to the Child-Pugh score, Grade 2 encephalopathy corresponds to 2 points. **Ascites:** The abdominal exam is negative for ascites. Therefore, there is no ascites. So, Ascites = None. According to the Child-Pugh score, no ascites corresponds to 1 point. **Bilirubin:** The bilirubin level is 40.2 umol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL. Using the conversion factor: 1 mg/dL = 17.1 umol/L. \[ \text{Bilirubin in mg/dL} = \frac{40.2 \, \text{umol/L}}{17.1 \, \text{(umol/L per mg/dL)}} \approx 2.35 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] Now we need to assign the score based on the bilirubin level: The Child-Pugh score for bilirubin is: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points - > 3 mg/dL = 3 points Since the bilirubin is approximately 2.35 mg/dL, it falls within the range of 2-3 mg/dL. So, Bilirubin = 2 points. **Albumin:** The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. The Child-Pugh score for albumin is: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - < 2.8 g/dL = 3 points Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls within the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL. So, Albumin = 2 points. **Prothrombin Time (INR):** The INR is 2.1. The Child-Pugh score for INR is: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - > 2.3 = 3 points Since the INR is 2.1, it falls within the range of 1.7-2.3. So, INR = 2 points. Now we sum up the points for each parameter: - Encephalopathy: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Bilirubin: 2 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points Total Child-Pugh score = 2 (Encephalopathy) + 1 (Ascites) + 2 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) = 9 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 9. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - A: 5-6 points - B: 7-9 points - C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh class B. Thus, the Child-Pugh score is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, and INR. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Encephalopathy**: The patient is oriented only to self and has asterixis. This indicates Grade 2 encephalopathy (stupor or lethargy). According to the Child-Pugh score, Grade 2 encephalopathy corresponds to 2 points.\n\n2. **Ascites**: The abdominal exam is negative for ascites. Therefore, there is no ascites. No ascites corresponds to 1 point.\n\n3. **Bilirubin**: The bilirubin level is 40.2 umol/L.

Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

I think hydrocortisone is about 1:1 with prednisone. But some say hydrocortisone 5 mg = prednisone 5 mg.</think> To convert the dosage of Hydrocortisone IV to Prednisone PO, we need to use the conversion factor between these two medications. The general conversion factor is that 5 mg of Hydrocortisone is roughly equivalent to 4 mg of Prednisone. Given that the patient has taken 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV, we can use the conversion factor to find the equivalent dose in Prednisone. The conversion factor is: 1 mg of Hydrocortisone ≈ 0.8 mg of Prednisone (since 5 mg Hydrocortisone ≈ 4 mg Prednisone). So, to convert 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone to Prednisone: \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose} = 152.535 \, \text{mg Hydrocortisone} \times \left(\frac{4 \, \text{mg Prednisone}}{5 \, \text{mg Hydrocortisone}}\right) \] Let's calculate this step by step. \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose} = 152.535 \times \frac{4}{5} \] \[ \text{Equivalent Prednisone dose} = 152.535 \times 0.8 \] Now, perform the multiplication: \[ 152.535 \times 0.8 = 122.028 \] So, the equivalent dosage of 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV in mg of Prednisone PO is approximately 122.028 mg. Thus, the answer is 122.028 mg of Prednisone PO. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To convert the dosage of Hydrocortisone IV to Prednisone PO, we use the conversion factor that 5 mg of Hydrocortisone is roughly equivalent to 4 mg of Prednisone.

Actually buccal fentanyl 1 mg = 100 MME.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME. The patient takes a 60 mg Fentanyl patch once a day. The conversion factor for Fentanyl patches is that 1 mcg/hour of fentanyl is approximately equal to 9 MME/day. However, the 60 mg Fentanyl patch is likely a typo or misinterpretation since typically Fentanyl patches are measured in mcg/hour. Let's assume the 60 mg Fentanyl patch is actually a 60 mcg/hour patch. If the patch is 60 mcg/hour, then the daily dose in MME is calculated as follows: \[ \text{MME from Fentanyl patch} = 60 \, \text{mcg/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times \left(\frac{1 \, \text{MME}}{9 \, \text{mcg/hour}}\right) \] \[ \text{MME from Fentanyl patch} = 60 \times 24 / 9 = 160 \, \text{MME}.\] Step 2: Convert the Hydrocodone (HydroMORphone) dose to MME. The patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day. The conversion factor for Hydrocodone is 1 mg = 4 MME. So the total daily dose of Hydrocodone is: \[ 20 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 3 \, \text{doses/day} = 60 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Now convert this to MME: \[ \text{MME from Hydrocodone} = 60 \, \text{mg/day} \times 4 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 240 \, \text{MME}. \] Step 3: Convert the Fentanyl buccal dose to MME. The patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day. The conversion factor for buccal Fentanyl is 1 mg = 100 MME. So the total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is: \[ 30 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 60 \, \text{mg/day}. \] Now convert this to MME: \[ \text{MME from Fentanyl buccal} = 60 \, \text{mg/day} \times 100 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 6000 \, \text{MME}. \] Now, sum up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME. \[ \text{Total MME} = \text{MME from Fentanyl patch} + \text{MME from Hydrocodone} + \text{MME from Fentanyl buccal} \] \[ \text{Total MME} = 160 + 240 + 6000 = 6400 \, \text{MME}. \] So the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 6400. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the total Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\nStep 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME.\nAssume the 60 mg Fentanyl patch is actually a 60 mcg/hour patch.\nUsing the conversion factor for Fentanyl patches: 1 mcg/hour of fentanyl = approximately 9 MME/day.\nFor a 60 mcg/hour patch:\n\[ \text{MME from Fentanyl patch} = 60 \, \text{mcg/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} / 9 = 160 \, \text{MME}. \]\n\nStep 2: Convert the Hydrocodone (HydroMORphone) dose to MME.\nThe patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day.\nThe conversion factor for Hydrocodone is 1 mg = 4 MME.\nTotal daily dose of Hydrocodone = 20 mg/dose * 3 doses/day = 60 mg/day.\nConvert this to MME:\n\[ \text{MME from Hydrocodone} = 60 \, \text{mg/day} \times 4 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 240 \, \text{MME}. \]\n\nStep 3: Convert the Fentanyl buccal dose to MME.\nThe patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day.\nThe conversion factor for buccal Fentanyl is 1 mg = 100 MME.\nTotal daily dose of Fentanyl buccal = 30 mg/dose * 2 doses/day = 60 mg/day.\nConvert this to MME:\n\[ \text{MME from Fentanyl buccal} = 60 \, \text{mg/day} \times 100 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 6000 \, \text{MME}. \]\n\nNow, sum up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME:\n\[ \text{Total MME} = 160 + 240 + 6000 = 6400 \, \text{MME}. \]", "answer": "6400"}

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Now let's evaluate each component of the CURB-65 score: 1. **Confusion**: The patient note does not mention any signs of confusion. Therefore, this criterion is not met. 2. **Urea (BUN) > 19 mg/dL**: The patient's BUN is 21 mg/dL. This criterion is met because 21 mg/dL > 19 mg/dL. 3. **Respiratory rate >= 30 breaths per minute**: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. This criterion is not met because 19 < 30. 4. **BP systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic < 60 mmHg**: The patient's blood pressure is 121/79 mmHg. This criterion is not met because the systolic BP (121 mmHg) is > 90 mmHg and the diastolic BP (79 mmHg) is > 60 mmHg. 5. **Age >= 65 years**: The patient is 41 years old. This criterion is not met because 41 < 65. Now let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea (BUN) > 19 mg/dL: Yes (1 point) - Respiratory rate >= 30 breaths per minute: No - BP systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic < 60 mmHg: No - Age >= 65 years: No So, the total score is 1 point. Therefore, the patient's CURB-65 score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to evaluate the following criteria: confusion, urea (BUN) > 19 mg/dL, respiratory rate >= 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure (systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic < 60 mmHg), and age >= 65 years. From the patient note, we have the following information:\n- Age: 41 years old.\n- Confusion: Not mentioned (so we assume no confusion).\n- Urea (BUN): 21 mg/dL.\n- Respiratory Rate (RR): 19 breaths per minute.\n- Blood Pressure (BP): 121/79 mmHg.\n\nNow let's evaluate each criterion:\n1.

Tramadol conversion factor 0.1. 60 mg twice =120 mg. 0.1 =>12 MME. Hydromorphone 10 mg once =10*4=40 MME.</think> Let's calculate step by step: Step 1: Convert Hydromorphone to MME. The patient takes 10 mg of Hydromorphone once a day. The conversion factor for Hydromorphone to MME is 4. So, 10 mg of Hydromorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 MME. Step 2: Convert Fentanyl patch to MME. The patient takes 40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day. This seems unusual because typically Fentanyl patches are measured in mcg/hour or mg and are applied for a certain duration (usually 72 hours). But since the problem gives us 40 mg of Fentanyl patch taken 3 times a day, we'll use the conversion factor for Fentanyl. The conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME is that 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl patch is approximately equal to 9 MME/day. But if we take the given information as 40 mg of Fentanyl patch, it's highly unusual and likely a mistake. However, let's assume the problem means 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch. If it's a 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch, the daily dose in MME would be calculated as follows: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl = 9 MME/day. So, 40 mcg/hour = 40 * 9 = 360 MME/day. Since the patient uses this patch 3 times a day, it seems incorrect because patches are not typically used multiple times a day. But if we follow the given instruction literally, we multiply the MME by 3: 360 MME/day * 3 = 1080 MME/day. Step 3: Convert Tramadol to MME. The patient takes 60 mg of Tramadol twice a day. So, the total daily dose of Tramadol is 60 mg * 2 = 120 mg. The conversion factor for Tramadol to MME is 0.1. So, 120 mg of Tramadol = 120 * 0.1 = 12 MME. Now, we add up all the MME from each medication: Hydromorphone MME = 40 MME Fentanyl patch MME = 1080 MME (assuming 40 mcg/hour patch used 3 times a day) Tramadol MME = 12 MME Total MME = 40 + 1080 + 12 = 1132 MME. But let's consider an alternative interpretation if the Fentanyl is actually 40 mg patches (which is very high and unusual). If the Fentanyl is 40 mg patches and each patch is used 3 times a day, this is highly unusual and likely incorrect. Typically, Fentanyl patches are used for 72 hours at a time. Let's assume the problem meant 40 mcg/hour patches. If it's 40 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch: 1 mcg/hour = 9 MME/day. So, 40 mcg/hour = 40 * 9 = 360 MME/day. If the patient uses this patch 3 times a day, it's likely incorrect. Let's assume the patch is applied once and lasts for 72 hours. If the Fentanyl patch is applied once a day (which is still unusual), the MME would be 360 MME/day. So the total MME would be: Hydromorphone MME = 40 MME Fentanyl patch MME = 360 MME (if applied once a day) Tramadol MME = 12 MME Total MME = 40 + 360 + 12 = 412 MME. Given the unusual nature of the problem, I'll provide both interpretations. 1. If the Fentanyl is 40 mcg/hour and used 3 times a day: Total MME = 1132. 2. If the Fentanyl is 40 mcg/hour and used once a day: Total MME = 412. Since the 40 mg Fentanyl patch seems unrealistic, the more plausible answer is the second one. So the final answer is 412 MME. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\nStep 1: Hydromorphone\nThe patient takes 10 mg of Hydromorphone once a day.\nThe conversion factor for Hydromorphone to MME is 4.\nSo, 10 mg of Hydromorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 MME.\n\nStep 2: Fentanyl\nThe patient takes 40 mg of Fentanyl patch 3 times a day.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period. The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position. During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis. On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Need 280 days, so remaining 55 days into 2021. So due date is 55 days after Jan 1 2021? Wait 2021 start. 55 days after Jan 1 is Feb 25? Let's compute: Jan has 31 days. 55-31=24. So Feb 24? Actually 24 days into Feb after Jan 31. Let's check: Jan 1 + 55 days = Feb 25? Let's compute: Jan 1 + 31 days = Feb 1 (since Jan 1 +31 = Feb 1). Then remaining 24 days: Feb 1 +24 = Feb 25.</think> So, the last menstrual period is 05/20/2020. The cycle length is 28 days, which is the standard cycle length used in Naegele's rule. Naegele's Rule: To calculate the due date, add 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period. Step 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The last menstrual period started on 05/20/2020. Adding 7 days to 05/20/2020 gives us 05/27/2020. Step 2: Add 9 months to the date obtained in Step 1. Adding 9 months to 05/27/2020 means moving forward 9 months from May 27, 2020. If we add 9 months to May 27, 2020: May + 9 months = February of the next year. Specifically, May + 9 months = February of the following year. So, 05/27/2020 + 9 months = 02/27/2021. Thus, the estimated due date is February 27, 2021. So the answer is 02/27/2021. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we follow these steps: \n1. Take the first day of the last menstrual period, which is 05/20/2020.\n2. Add 7 days to this date. 05/20/2020 + 7 days = 05/27/2020.\n3. Then add 9 months to this new date. Adding 9 months to May 27, 2020 takes us to February 27, 2021.\nTherefore, the estimated due date is February 27, 2021.", "answer": "02/27/2021"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.\nThis study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.", 'Question': "What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '313', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need serum osmolality formula: 2*(Na+ + K+) + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8.  \nUse initial values? likely at admission: sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 3.2 mmol/L, glucose 569 mg/dL, BUN 25.9 mg/dL.  \nCompute: 2*(133+3.2)=2*136.2=272.4.  \nGlucose/18=569/18=31.61.  \nBUN/2.8=25.9/2.8=9.25.', 'LLM Explanation': 'Serum osmolality is calculated with the formula: 2×(Na⁺+K⁺) + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8.

The GCS is calculated by adding up scores from three components: Eye opening response, Verbal response, and Motor response. - **Eye Opening Response:** - The note does not explicitly mention the patient's eye opening response. However, it says "Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light." This suggests that the patient's eyes are not opening spontaneously or in response to stimuli. The GCS scoring for Eye Opening is as follows: - 4: Spontaneous - 3: To speech - 2: To pain - 1: None Since the note doesn't mention the patient opening her eyes spontaneously, in response to speech, or in response to pain, and only mentions the pupils being unreactive to light, we can assume that the patient is not opening her eyes at all. Therefore, the score for Eye Opening is 1 (None). - **Verbal Response:** - The note states that "Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated." The GCS scoring for Verbal Response is as follows: - 5: Oriented - 4: Confused - 3: Inappropriate words - 2: Incomprehensible sounds - 1: None Since the patient's speech is described as incomprehensible and she only grunts and moans, the appropriate score here is 2 (Incomprehensible sounds). - **Motor Response:** - The note says, "A pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities." The GCS scoring for Motor Response is as follows: - 6: Obeys commands - 5: Localizes to pain - 4: Withdraws from pain - 3: Abnormal flexion (decorticate posturing) - 2: Abnormal extension (decerebrate posturing) - 1: No response Since the patient withdraws from pain when pinched on the nail bed, the score for Motor Response is 4 (Withdraws from pain). Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - Eye Opening: 1 - Verbal Response: 2 - Motor Response: 4 The total GCS = 1 (Eye) + 2 (Verbal) + 4 (Motor) = 7. Therefore, the patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 7. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate three components: Eye Opening Response, Verbal Response, and Motor Response.\n\n1. **Eye Opening Response:** - The note indicates that the patient's pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light, and there is no mention of the patient opening her eyes spontaneously, to speech, or to pain. Therefore, the score for Eye Opening is 1 (None).\n 2. **Verbal Response:** - The note states that the patient's speech is incomprehensible and she grunts and moans but does not say any discernible words. This corresponds to a score of 2 (Incomprehensible sounds) for the Verbal Response.\n 3. **Motor Response:** - The note mentions that a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in the patient's extremities. This corresponds to a score of 4 (Withdraws from pain) for the Motor Response.\n Now, we sum up the scores from each component: - Eye Opening: 1 - Verbal Response: 2 - Motor Response: 4 The total GCS = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n Therefore, the patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 7.", "answer": "7"}

Using Naegele's Rule for estimated due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length, what is the the patient's estimated due date? Your response should be in the format of M/D/Y (ie 08/31/2023, 07/03/2000) with just the date and not other text. 

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED We need due date: LMP 04/09/2021.  
Cycle 25 days.  
Naegele: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP.  
But cycle length adjustment: subtract (cycle length - 28) days?  
Actually due date = LMP + 280 days - (cycle length - 28).  
So 280 - (25-28)=280+3=283 days.  
Add 283 days to April 9 2021.  
2021 not leap.  
April 9 + 283 days.  
2021 days: April 9 to Dec 31: April 22 days left (30-9=21? Wait April 9 inclusive? Let's compute: days remaining in April after 9th: 30-9=21. May 31, June 30, July 31, Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 31, Nov 30, Dec 31. Sum: 21+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31= 26? Let's sum: 21+31=52; +30=82; +31=113; +31=144; +30=174; +31=205; +30=235; +31=266. So 266 days remaining in 2021 after April 9.  
Need 283 days, so 283-266=17 days into 2022.

Need 283 days, so 283-266=17 days into 2022.</think> Now, 17 days into 2022 from the start of the year: January has 31 days. So 17 days into 2022 is within January. Counting 17 days from January 1st, 2022: January 1st + 16 days = January 17th. Thus the due date is January 17, 2022. But let's use an alternative approach to verify this. Using Naegele's Rule for a standard 28-day cycle first and then adjust for the cycle length. For a standard 28-day cycle: Naegele's Rule: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP and subtract 3 months, then add one year if the result is before the original month. LMP: April 9, 2021. Step 1: Add 7 days to April 9, 2021. April 9 + 7 days = April 16, 2021. Step 2: Subtract 3 months from April 16, 2021. Subtracting 3 months from April 16, 2021 takes us to January 16, 2021. Since this is before the original month (April), we add one year to January 16, 2021. January 16, 2021 + 1 year = January 16, 2022. So the due date for a standard 28-day cycle is January 16, 2022. Now, we need to adjust for the cycle length of 25 days. The adjustment for a cycle that is not 28 days is to add the difference between 28 and the cycle length to the due date. Since the cycle is 25 days, the difference is 28 - 25 = 3 days. So we add 3 days to the due date obtained from the standard cycle. January 16, 2022 + 3 days = January 19, 2022. Thus the estimated due date is January 19, 2022. So the final answer is 01/19/2022. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule adjusted for a cycle length of 25 days, we start with the last menstrual period (LMP), which is April 9, 2021. The standard Naegele's Rule for a 28-day cycle involves adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then subtracting 3 months. If the resulting date is before the original month, add one year.\n\nStep 1: Add 7 days to April 9, 2021.\nApril 9 + 7 days = April 16, 2021.\n\nStep 2: Subtract 3 months from April 16, 2021.\nSubtracting 3 months from April 16, 2021 takes us to January 16, 2021.\nSince this is before the original month (April), we add one year to January 16, 2021.\nJanuary 16, 2021 + 1 year = January 16, 2022.\n\nSo the due date for a standard 28-day cycle is January 16, 2022.\n\nNow, we need to adjust for the cycle length of 25 days. The difference between the standard cycle (28 days) and the patient's cycle (25 days) is 28 - 25 = 3 days. We add these 3 days to the due date obtained from the standard cycle.\nJanuary 16, 2022 + 3 days = January 19, 2022.\n\nTherefore, the estimated due date is January 19, 2022.", "answer": "01/19/2022"}

Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene). The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2. At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL). The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support. On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out. After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition. Here is the task: Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think>Need maintenance fluid calculation.

Use 30 kg.</think> Step 1: Calculate the maintenance fluid for the patient using the Holliday-Segar formula. The Holliday-Segar formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements is as follows: - For the first 10 kg: 100 mL/kg - For the next 10 kg (11-20 kg): 50 mL/kg - For any weight above 20 kg: 20 mL/kg The patient's weight is 30 kg. Step 2: Break down the weight into segments and calculate the fluid requirement for each segment. For the first 10 kg: \[ \text{Fluid} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 100 \, \text{mL/kg} = 1000 \, \text{mL/day} \] For the next 10 kg (from 11 to 20 kg): \[ \text{Fluid} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 50 \, \text{mL/kg} = 500 \, \text{mL/day} \] For the remaining weight (above 20 kg), which is \(30 \, \text{kg} - 20 \, \text{kg} = 10 \, \text{kg}\): \[ \text{Fluid} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{mL/kg} = 200 \, \text{mL/day} \] Step 3: Add up the fluid requirements from all segments to get the total daily maintenance fluid requirement. \[ \text{Total daily fluid} = 1000 \, \text{mL} + 500 \, \text{mL} + 200 \, \text{mL} = 1700 \, \text{mL/day} \] Step 4: Convert the total daily fluid requirement to mL/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so: \[ \text{Maintenance fluid in mL/hr} = \frac{1700 \, \text{mL}}{24 \, \text{hours}} \approx 70.83 \, \text{mL/hr} \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives approximately 71 mL/hr. Thus, the patient's maintenance fluid is approximately 71 mL/hr. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the maintenance fluid for the patient, we use the Holliday-Segar formula.

LMP 03/24/2017.
Cycle length 30 days.
Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP.
But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))?
Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP.
For cycle length >28, subtract days difference?
Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later.
So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28).
So 280 + 2 = 282 days.

LMP 03/24/2017. Cycle length 30 days. Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP. But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))? Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP. For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days. Let's compute. March 24, 2017 + 282 days. Compute: 2017 is not leap year? 2017 not leap. Days remaining in March after 24: 31-24=7 days. So after March 31, 7 days used. Remaining days: 282-7=275. April 30 days -> 275-30=245 May 31 -> 245-31=214 June 30 -> 214-30=184 July 31 -> 184-31=153 August 31 -> 153-31=122 September 30 -> 122-30=92 October 31 -> 92-31=61 November 30 -> 61-30=31 December 31 -> 31-31=0 Check: Did we overshoot? Let's double-check: Starting March 24 inclusive? Usually add days after LMP.</think> Let's use the standard Naegele's rule first and then adjust for the cycle length. Step 1: Use Naegele's rule for a standard 28-day cycle. Naegele's rule states that the due date is calculated by adding 280 days to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP), and then adding 7 days and subtracting 3 months from the LMP. LMP: 03/24/2017. Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP. 03/24/2017 + 7 days = 03/31/2017. Step 2: Subtract 3 months from this date. Subtracting 3 months from 03/31/2017 takes us to 12/31/2016. But since we added 7 days and subtracted 3 months, we need to add 9 months instead of subtracting 3 months from the original month and add the 7 days. Alternatively, we can use the method of adding 9 months and 7 days to the LMP. Adding 9 months to 03/24/2017: March + 9 months = December. So, 03/24/2017 + 9 months = 12/24/2017. Now add 7 days to 12/24/2017: 12/24/2017 + 7 days = 12/31/2017. So the due date using Naegele's rule for a standard 28-day cycle is 12/31/2017. Now, let's adjust for the cycle length of 30 days. Since the cycle length is 30 days (which is 2 days longer than the standard 28-day cycle), the ovulation occurs 2 days later than in a 28-day cycle. Therefore, the due date should be adjusted by adding these 2 extra days to the due date calculated using the standard Naegele's rule. So, we take the due date from the standard calculation, which is 12/31/2017, and add 2 days to it. 12/31/2017 + 2 days = 01/02/2018. Thus, the estimated due date for the patient with an LMP of 03/24/2017 and a cycle length of 30 days is 01/02/2018. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's rule and adjusting for the cycle length:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

Ascites not mentioned: assume none?</think> Let's calculate the Child-Pugh score step by step. Step 1: Identify the parameters for the Child-Pugh score: - Bilirubin (mg/dL) - Albumin (g/dL) - INR - Encephalopathy Grade - Ascites Step 2: Assign the values from the patient note: - Bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL - Albumin: 3.3 g/dL - INR: 1.6 - Encephalopathy Grade: Stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy (mentioned as progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy) - Ascites: Not mentioned, so we will assume no ascites (none). Now let's assign the points for each parameter according to the Child-Pugh score criteria: 1. **Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - < 2: 1 point - 2-3: 2 points - 3-6: 3 points - > 6: 4 points The patient's bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls into the range < 2. Therefore, it gets 1 point. 2. **Albumin (g/dL):** - > 3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.8: 3 points - < 2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 3.3 g/dL, which falls into the range 2.8-3.5. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 3. **INR:** - < 1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - > 3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.6, which falls into the range < 1.7. Therefore, it gets 1 point. 4. **Encephalopathy Grade:** - None: 1 point - Grade I-II: 2 points - Grade III-IV: 3 points The patient has stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy, which corresponds to Grade III-IV. Therefore, it gets 3 points. 5. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points Since ascites is not mentioned, we will assume no ascites. Therefore, it gets 1 point. Now, let's add up the points for each parameter: - Bilirubin: 1 point - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 1 point - Encephalopathy: 3 points - Ascites: 1 point Total Child-Pugh Score = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 points. The Child-Pugh score is 8. Now, let's convert this score to the Child-Pugh class: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 8, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B.

Next period would be LMP + 29 days.  
So ovulation day = LMP + 29 - 14 = LMP + 15.  
So conception likely around ovulation day.  
So conception date = LMP + 15 days.</think>

For 29-day cycle, ovulation day = LMP + 14? Actually typical: ovulation occurs 14 days before next period. Next period would be LMP + 29 days. So ovulation day = LMP + 29 - 14 = LMP + 15. So conception likely around ovulation day. So conception date = LMP + 15 days.</think> Let's calculate this step by step. Step 1: Identify the last menstrual period (LMP): 10/11/2020. Step 2: The cycle length is 29 days. Step 3: To find the estimated date of conception, we need to calculate the ovulation day. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs around 14 days before the next expected period. The next expected period would be 29 days after the LMP, i.e., 10/11/2020 + 29 days. To find the date 29 days after 10/11/2020: - October has 31 days. - From 10/11/2020 to the end of October: 31 - 11 = 20 days. - Remaining days to reach the total of 29 days: 29 - 20 = 9 days into November. So, 29 days after 10/11/2020 is November 9, 2020. Now, ovulation occurs approximately 14 days before the next expected period. Therefore, the ovulation day is 14 days before November 9, 2020. To calculate 14 days before November 9, 2020: - Subtract 14 days from November 9, 2020. November has 30 days. If we subtract 14 days from November 9, 2020: - 9 - 14 = -5. This means we go back 5 days into October. Since November has 30 days, 9 days before November 9 is within the same month. But since we need to go back 14 days, we need to go back to October. To find the date 14 days before November 9, 2020: - November 9 - 14 days = November 9 - 9 days in November = October 31 + (9 - 9) = October 31 + 0 = October 31. - We still have to subtract the remaining 5 days from October 31. - October 31 - 5 = October 26. So, 14 days before November 9, 2020 is October 26, 2020. Therefore, the estimated date of conception is around the ovulation day, which is October 26, 2020. Alternatively, we can use the simpler method mentioned earlier: ovulation day = LMP + 15 days. Let's calculate LMP + 15 days from 10/11/2020. Starting from October 11, 2020, and adding 15 days: - From October 11 to the end of October: 31 - 11 = 20 days. - We need to add 15 days. Since 15 days is less than the remaining 20 days in October, we can simply add 15 days within October. October 11 + 15 days: - October 11 + 15 = October 26. So, 10/11/2020 + 15 days = October 26, 2020. Thus, the estimated date of conception is October 26, 2020. So the answer is 10/26/2020. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the estimated date of conception, we use the information that conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation. For a 29-day cycle, ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the next expected period. The next expected period would be 29 days after the LMP (10/11/2020), which is November 9, 2020. Therefore, ovulation occurs 14 days before November 9, 2020, which is October 26, 2020. Alternatively, we can use the formula for ovulation day in a 29-day cycle: LMP + 15 days. Adding 15 days to 10/11/2020 gives us October 26, 2020. Thus, the estimated date of conception is October 26, 2020.", "answer": "10/26/2020"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.\nThe patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.\nFurther laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.\nDue to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).\nDischarged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.', 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '8.8', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Delta gap = anion gap - (Na - (Cl + HCO3)).  \nNeed initial values: Na 134, Cl 105, HCO3 17. AG 20.8.', 'LLM Explanation': '1. Identify the initial anion gap (AG) and the electrolytes used for the delta gap calculation. The initial AG is 20.8 mEq/L. The electrolytes are sodium (Na = 134 mmol/L), chloride (Cl = 105 mmol/L), and bicarbonate (HCO₃ = 17 mEq/L). 2. Compute the expected normal anion gap: Na – (Cl + HCO₃) = 134 – (105 + 17) = 134 – 122 = 12 mEq/L. 3. Calculate the delta gap: ΔAG = AG – (Na – (Cl + HCO₃)) = 20.8 – 12 = 8.8 mEq/L.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '8.8', 'Target Explanation': 'To calculate the delta gap, we first need to calculate the anion gap using the formula: Anion gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3). Given the values: Sodium (Na) = 134 mmol/L, Chloride (Cl) = 105 mmol/L, and Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 17 mEq/L. We plug these into the formula: Anion gap = 134 - (105 + 17) = 134 - 122 = 12 mEq/L. The measured anion gap from the patient note is 20.8 mEq/L. The delta gap is the difference between the measured anion gap and the calculated anion gap: Delta gap = Measured anion gap - Calculated anion gap = 20.8 mEq/L - 12 mEq/L = 8.8 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

Drugs: none.</think> Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the HAS-BLED criteria and their corresponding points for the given patient. The HAS-BLED score has the following components: - H: Hypertension (systolic BP >160 mmHg or diastolic BP >100 mmHg) or poorly controlled hypertension. - A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function. - S: Stroke. - B: Bleeding history or predisposition. - L: Labile INR (INR outside the therapeutic range >50% of the time). - E: Elderly (Age >65 years). - D: Drugs/Alcohol (Concomitant use of drugs or alcohol). Now let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension that is poorly controlled recently. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function** - The patient has end-stage liver fibrosis (which indicates abnormal liver function). There is no mention of renal pathologies, so the renal function is not abnormal. However, since the liver function is abnormal, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 3. **S: Stroke** - There is no mention of a history of stroke in the patient's note. This criterion is not met. Score = 0. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient has a history of a major bleeding episode in the past. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 5. **L: Labile INR** - The patient is not taking any blood-thinning agents or medications known to predispose to bleeding, so there is no mention of INR fluctuations. This criterion is not met. Score = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (Age > 65 years)** - The patient is 67 years old, which is above 65. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 7. **D: Drugs/Alcohol** - The patient admits to mild alcohol consumption, about 3 drinks per week. This is not considered heavy alcohol use (typically defined as more than 1 drink/day for women and more than 2 drinks/day for men). Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. Now, let's add up the scores from each criterion: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver Function): 1 - S (Stroke): 0 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 1 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly): 1 - D (Drugs/Alcohol): 0 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4. So the patient's HAS-BLED score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for the patient, we will evaluate each component of the HAS-BLED score based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n1. **H: Hypertension**: The patient has longstanding hypertension that is poorly controlled recently.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

According to the Child-Pugh classification: - < 2 mg/dL = 1 point. - 2-3 mg/dL = 2 points. - > 3 mg/dL = 3 points. Since the bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range < 2 mg/dL. Therefore, it gets 1 point. 4. **Albumin**: The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point. - 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL = 2 points. - < 2.8 g/dL = 3 points. Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls into the range 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL. Therefore, it gets 2 points. 5. **INR**: The INR is 1.8. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - < 1.7 = 1 point. - 1.7 - 2.3 = 2 points. - > 2.3 = 3 points. Since the INR is 1.8, it falls into the range 1.7 - 2.3. Therefore, it gets 2 points. Now, let's sum up the points for each parameter: - Encephalopathy: 2 points - Ascites: 1 point - Bilirubin: 1 point - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points Adding these up: 2 (Encephalopathy) + 1 (Ascites) + 1 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) = 8 points. According to the Child-Pugh classification, the scores are categorized as follows: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 8 points, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. The Child-Pugh score is the total sum of the points, which is 8. So the answer is 8. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: encephalopathy grade, ascites, bilirubin level, albumin level, and INR.\n\n1. **Encephalopathy Grade**: The patient shows confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech, indicating at least Grade II encephalopathy. Therefore, the score for encephalopathy is 2 points.\n\n2. **Ascites**: There is no mention of ascites in the note. Thus, we assume no ascites, which corresponds to 1 point.\n\n3. **Bilirubin**: The total bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification, a bilirubin level < 2 mg/dL corresponds to 1 point.\n\n4. **Albumin**: The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the classification, an albumin level between 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL corresponds to 2 points.\n\n5. **INR**: The INR is 1.8. According to the classification, an INR between 1.7 - 2.3 corresponds to 2 points.\n\nNow, we add up the points from each parameter:\n- Encephalopathy: 2 points\n- Ascites: 1 point\n- Bilirubin: 1 point\n- Albumin: 2 points\n- INR: 2 points\n\nTotal score = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8 points.\n\nThus, the Child-Pugh score is 8.", "answer": "8"}

Using the formula: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR) = 330 / 0.860. Let's calculate this step by step. 330 / 0.860 ≈ 383.72. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 384 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 384 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula, we use the formula: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR), where QT is the QT interval in milliseconds and RR is the RR interval in seconds. The RR interval can be calculated from the heart rate (HR). Given the heart rate is 81 bpm, the RR interval is the time between two consecutive heartbeats, which is 60 seconds / 81 bpm = 0.7407 seconds. Next, we need to calculate the square root of the RR interval: sqrt(0.7407) ≈ 0.8607. Now we plug in the values into the Framingham formula: QTc = 330 msec / 0.8607 ≈ 383.4 msec. Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 383 msec.", "answer": "384"} However, let's do the math more precisely. 1. Calculate the RR interval in seconds from the heart rate: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} = \frac{60}{81} \approx 0.7407 \, \text{seconds}. \] 2. Calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.7407} \approx 0.8606. \] 3. Use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{0.8606} \approx 383.44. \] Rounding 383.44 to the nearest whole number gives us 383.

He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries.

The ECG score is 1 (ST depression). Step 3: Age The patient is 35 years old. The age score is 0 if < 65 years old. Therefore, the age score is 0. Step 4: Risk factors The patient is a smoker (20 cigarettes a day). Smoking is a risk factor. Therefore, the risk factor score is 1. Step 5: Troponin There is no information about troponin levels in the given patient note. Therefore, the troponin score is 0. Now we add up the scores: History = 1 ECG = 1 Age = 0 Risk factors = 1 Troponin = 0 HEART score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3.

He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3.

Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test.

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

A 58-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following the deterioration of his conscious state; currently, he is rated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10. He is presently on mechanical ventilation, with FiO₂ at 54 %, and his arterial blood gas shows a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. Furthermore, there are ongoing infusions of multiple vasopressors to maintain his hemodynamic stability, including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. His systolic and diastolic blood pressure recorded at 120 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg, respectively. Biochemical findings show creatinine measurement at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function, while the bilirubin level stood at 2.3 mg/dL. His platelet count is 175,000/µL.

SOFA: 15=0, 13-14=1, 9-12=2, 6-8=3, <=5=4.</think> Now let's calculate each component of the SOFA score step by step. 1. **Respiratory (PaO2/FiO2):** - PaO2 = 76 mmHg - FiO2 = 0.54 - PaO2/FiO2 = 76 / 0.54 ≈ 140.74 - According to the SOFA scoring for respiratory function: - > 400 = 0 - 300-400 = 1 - 200-300 = 2 - 100-200 = 3 - ≤ 100 = 4 - Since 140.74 falls between 100 and 200, the score is 3. 2. **Hepatic (Bilirubin):** - Bilirubin = 2.3 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for hepatic function: - < 1.2 = 0 - 1.2 - 1.9 = 1 - 2.0 - 5.9 = 2 - 6.0 - 11.9 = 3 - ≥ 12 = 4 - Since 2.3 falls within the range 2.0 - 5.9, the score is 2. 3. **Hematologic (Platelets):** - Platelet count = 175,000/µL - According to the SOFA scoring for hematologic function: - > 150,000 = 0 - 100,000 - 150,000 = 1 - 50,000 - 99,999 = 2 - 20,000 - 49,999 = 3 - < 20,000 = 4 - Since the platelet count is 175,000, which is > 150,000, the score is 0. 4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Support):** - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3 - Systolic = 120 mmHg, Diastolic = 75 mmHg - MAP = (2 * 75 + 120) / 3 = (150 + 120) / 3 = 270 / 3 = 90 mmHg. - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. To calculate the cardiovascular score, we need to consider both the MAP and the vasopressor support. - If MAP >= 70 mmHg and no vasopressors, the score is 0. - If MAP >= 70 mmHg and vasopressors are used, we need to determine the score based on the vasopressor dose. - If MAP < 70 mmHg, the score is based on the MAP value. Since the MAP is 90 mmHg (which is >= 70 mmHg), we need to look at the vasopressor support. The SOFA scoring for vasopressors is as follows: - No vasopressors = 0 - Dopamine < 5 mcg/kg/min or any other vasopressor < 0 mcg/kg/min = 1 - Dopamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min or any other vasopressor 0-15 mcg/kg/min = 2 - Dopamine > 15 mcg/kg/min or any other vasopressor > 15 mcg/kg/min = 3 - Vasopressin or norepinephrine or epinephrine or any combination = 4 Let's calculate the total vasopressor support: - NorEPINEPHrine (norepinephrine) = 0.1 mcg/kg/min - EPINEPHrine (epinephrine) = 0.1 mcg/kg/min - DOPamine = 7 mcg/kg/min - DOBUTamine = 1 mcg/kg/min Dobutamine is not considered a vasopressor for the SOFA score. Therefore, we will consider norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. The total vasopressor support is: - Norepinephrine = 0.1 mcg/kg/min - Epinephrine = 0.1 mcg/kg/min - Dopamine = 7 mcg/kg/min Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors including norepinephrine and epinephrine, we can directly use the rule that the presence of norepinephrine or epinephrine (or vasopressin) gives a score of 4. Therefore, the cardiovascular score is 4. 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for renal function: - < 1.2 = 0 - 1.2 - 1.9 = 1 - 2.0 - 3.4 = 2 - 3.5 - 4.9 = 3 - ≥ 5 = 4 - Since 1.4 falls within the range 1.2 - 1.9, the score is 1. 6. **Neurologic (Glasgow Coma Scale):** - GCS = 10 - According to the SOFA scoring for neurologic function: - 15 = 0 - 13-14 = 1 - 9-12 = 2 - 6-8 = 3 - ≤ 5 = 4 - Since the GCS is 10, which falls within the range 9-12, the score is 2. Now, let's sum up all the scores from each component: - Respiratory (PaO2/FiO2): 3 - Hepatic (Bilirubin): 2 - Hematologic (Platelets): 0 - Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressors): 4 - Renal (Creatinine): 1 - Neurologic (GCS): 2 Total SOFA score = 3 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 12. So the final answer is 12. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six organ systems: Respiratory, Hepatic, Hematologic, Cardiovascular, Renal, and Neurologic.

The laboratory results revealed an INR of 1.9, increasing the concern for impaired liver function. His serum total bilirubin was 2.0 mg/dL and albumin was 3.2 g/dL, indicating diminished liver function. The patient's blood glucose was 120 mg/dL, raising the suspicion of prediabetes, and his creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL, indicating good renal function. He was ordered to abstain from alcohol consumption, maintain a balanced diet, and monitor his blood glucose regularly. His medications including diuretics and antihypertensives remained unaltered until his next appointment. Here is the task: What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think>We need Child-Pugh score: parameters: encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, INR. We have mild asterixis (encephalopathy grade 1). No ascites. Bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL (score 1). Albumin 3.2 g/dL (score 2). INR 1.9 (score 2).</think> Let's calculate the Child-Pugh score step by step. Step 1: Evaluate the encephalopathy grade. The patient has mild asterixis, which indicates some degree of hepatic encephalopathy. Mild asterixis is typically associated with Grade 1 encephalopathy in the Child-Pugh score. Step 2: Evaluate the presence of ascites. The note states "There was no evidence of ascites." Therefore, the ascites score is Grade 0 or Grade 1 (no or only mild ascites). Since there is no evidence of ascites, we'll assign it to Grade 1 (no ascites). Step 3: Evaluate the bilirubin level. The bilirubin level is 2.0 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - Bilirubin < 1.0 mg/dL = Grade 1 - 1.0 - 1.9 mg/dL = Grade 2 - 2.0 - 3.0 mg/dL = Grade 3 - > 3.0 mg/dL = Grade 4 Since the bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL, it falls into the range of 2.0 - 3.0 mg/dL, which corresponds to Grade 3. Step 4: Evaluate the albumin level. The albumin level is 3.2 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - Albumin > 3.5 g/dL = Grade 1 - 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL = Grade 2 - 2.1 - 2.7 g/dL = Grade 3 - < 2.1 g/dL = Grade 4 Since the albumin is 3.2 g/dL, it falls into the range of 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL, which corresponds to Grade 2. Step 5: Evaluate the INR. The INR is 1.9. According to the Child-Pugh score criteria: - INR < 1.7 = Grade 1 - 1.7 - 2.3 = Grade 2 - 2.4 - 3.0 = Grade 3 - > 3.0 = Grade 4 Since the INR is 1.9, it falls into the range of 1.7 - 2.3, which corresponds to Grade 2. Now we have the following scores for each parameter: - Encephalopathy: Grade 1 (mild asterixis indicates Grade 1) - Ascites: Grade 1 (no ascites) - Bilirubin: Grade 3 (2.0 mg/dL falls in the 2.0 - 3.0 mg/dL range) - Albumin: Grade 2 (3.2 g/dL falls in the 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL range) - INR: Grade 2 (1.9 falls in the 1.7 - 2.3 range) Now we sum up the scores for the Child-Pugh classification: - Encephalopathy: Grade 1 = 1 point - Ascites: Grade 1 = 1 point - Bilirubin: Grade 3 = 3 points - Albumin: Grade 2 = 2 points - INR: Grade 2 = 2 points Adding these up: 1 (encephalopathy) + 1 (ascites) + 3 (bilirubin) + 2 (albumin) + 2 (INR) = 9 points. According to the Child-Pugh score classification: - Child-Pugh A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 9, the patient falls into Child-Pugh Class B. The Child-Pugh score is the sum of the points, which is 9. So the answer is 9. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, and INR. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Encephalopathy: The patient has mild asterixis, which corresponds to Grade 1 (1 point).\n2. Ascites: No evidence of ascites, so this corresponds to Grade 1 (1 point).\n3.

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.', 'Question': "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m².", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '18.08', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)^2.  \nHeight 156 cm = 1.56 m.  \nWeight 44 kg.', 'LLM Explanation': 'BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The patient’s height is 156 cm, which is 1.56 m. Her weight is 44 kg. Thus BMI = 44 kg / (1.56 m)^2 = 44 / 2.4336 ≈ 18.08 kg/m².', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '18.08', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's BMI, we use the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2. The patient's height is 156 cm, which converts to 1.56 m. The patient's weight is 44 kg. First, we square the height in meters: (1.56 m)^2 = 2.4336 m^2. Next, we divide the weight by this squared height: 44 kg / 2.4336 m^2 ≈ 18.08 kg/m². Therefore, the patient's BMI is approximately 18.08 kg/m².", 'Ground Truth Answer': '18.08', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 156.0 cm, which is 156.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.56 m. The patient's weight is 44.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 44.0 kg / (1.56 m * 1.56 m) = 18.08 kg/m^2.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

The formula is: BSA = 0.007184 * weight^0.425 * height^0.725 Given: Weight = 100 kg Height = 172 cm Let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate weight^0.425: \[100^{0.425}\] Using a calculator, we get: \[100^{0.425} \approx 6.454\] 2. Calculate height^0.725: \[172^{0.725}\] Using a calculator, we get: \[172^{0.725} \approx 30.04\] Now multiply these results with the constant 0.007184: \[ BSA = 0.007184 * 6.454 * 30.04 \] First, multiply 6.454 and 30.04: \[ 6.454 * 30.04 \approx 194.00 \] Now multiply this result by 0.007184: \[ BSA = 0.007184 * 194.00 \approx 1.399 \] Rounded to two decimal places, the BSA is approximately 1.40 m². So the patient's body surface area is approximately 1.9 m². Let's use the calculator for the final accurate calculation. Using the formula BSA = 0.007184 * (weight in kg)^0.425 * (height in cm)^0.725 Plugging in the values: \[ BSA = 0.007184 * (100)^{0.425} * (172)^{0.725} \] Using a calculator: \[ 100^{0.425} \approx 6.454 \] \[ 172^{0.725} \approx 30.04 \] Now multiply these: \[ BSA = 0.007184 * 6.454 * 30.04 \] First, multiply 6.454 and 30.04: \[ 6.454 * 30.04 \approx 194.00 \] Then multiply by 0.007184: \[ BSA = 0.007184 * 194.00 \approx 1.399 \] So the BSA is approximately 1.40 m².

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm.

Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition.

The Child-Pugh classification for albumin is as follows: - > 3.5 g/dL = 1 point - 2.8-3.5 g/dL = 2 points - 2.1-2.8 g/dL = 3 points - < 2.1 g/dL = 4 points. Since the albumin is 2.8 g/dL, it falls into the 2.8-3.5 g/dL range, so it gets 2 points.\\n\\n5. **INR**: The INR is 1.9. The Child-Pugh classification for INR is as follows: - < 1.7 = 1 point - 1.7-2.3 = 2 points - 2.4-3.0 = 3 points - > 3.0 = 4 points. Since the INR is 1.9, it falls into the 1.7-2.3 range, so it gets 2 points.\\n\\nNow, we sum up the points from each parameter: - Encephalopathy: 1 point - Ascites: 2 points - Bilirubin: 2 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points Adding these points together: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9 points. Thus, the Child-Pugh score is 9.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '9', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current child pugh score is 0.\nThe patient's INR is 1.9. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 2.8 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is less than 2.8 g/dL, we add 3 to the score, making the current total 4 + 3 = 7.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 7 + 2 = 9.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 9.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

Age: The patient is 67 years old. - For women, age 67 corresponds to 1 point. 2. Smoking: The patient does not smoke. - No smoking = 0 points. 3. Total Cholesterol: The patient's total cholesterol is 196 mg/dL. - Total cholesterol levels: - <160 mg/dL = 0 points - 160-199 mg/dL = 1 point - 200-239 mg/dL = 2 points - 240-279 mg/dL = 3 points - >= 280 mg/dL = 4 points Since the patient's total cholesterol is 196 mg/dL, this falls into the range of 160-199 mg/dL, which corresponds to 1 point. 4. HDL Cholesterol: The patient's HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL. - HDL cholesterol levels: - <35 mg/dL = 2 points - 35-44 mg/dL = 1 point - >= 45 mg/dL = 0 points Since the patient's HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL, this falls into the range of >= 45 mg/dL, which corresponds to 0 points. 5. Systolic Blood Pressure: The patient's systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg. - The patient is on antihypertensive medication (lisinopril and metoprolol), and her systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg. - If on treatment for hypertension, the points are assigned based on the systolic blood pressure as follows: - <120 = 0 points - 120-129 = 1 point - 130-139 = 2 points - 140-149 = 3 points - 150-159 = 4 points - >= 160 = 5 points Since the patient's systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg and she is on treatment for hypertension, this falls into the range of 140-149 mm Hg, which corresponds to 3 points. Now, let's add up all the points: - Age: 1 point - Smoking: 0 points - Total Cholesterol: 1 point - HDL Cholesterol: 0 points - Systolic Blood Pressure (on treatment): 3 points Total points = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 5 points. According to the Framingham Risk Score for women: - 5-6 points correspond to a 1-2% risk. So the patient's Framingham Risk Score falls within the 1-2% risk range. Thus, the Framingham Risk Score is within the range corresponding to 5 points. The answer is that the patient has a Framingham Risk Score of 5 points, which corresponds to a 1-2% 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to use the Framingham Risk Score points system for women.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Not mentioned.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the components of the HAS-BLED score. The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those on anticoagulation therapy. It includes the following factors: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg) - A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation) - E: Elderly (>65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of drugs or alcohol) Now let's evaluate each component based on the given patient note: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg or DBP > 100 mmHg)** - The patient's blood pressure is 164/113 mmHg.

Therefore, this factor is present. - Score for H = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal Renal/Liver Function** - The note states that there are no predominant signs of renal impairment, and creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are normal. There is no mention of liver function tests or any liver issues. - Therefore, this factor is not present. - Score for A = 0. 3. **S: Stroke** - The patient has a history of stroke. - Therefore, this factor is present. - Score for S = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes. - Therefore, this factor is not present. - Score for B = 0. 5. **L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation)** - The note mentions that the INR has consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. - Therefore, this factor is not present. - Score for L = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (>65 years)** - The patient is 70 years old, which is greater than 65 years. - Therefore, this factor is present. - Score for E = 1. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of drugs or alcohol)** - The patient denies alcohol consumption, reporting zero drinks per week. There is no mention of concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk (like NSAIDs or aspirin). - Therefore, this factor is not present. - Score for D = 0.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

Here is the task: What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think>Delta gap = serum bicarbonate - (Na + K - Cl). Corrected for albumin: add 2.5 mEq per g/dL decrease? Actually correction: add 2.5 mEq per g/dL decrease in albumin.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the relevant lab values from the patient note. From the patient note, we have the following initial lab values: - Serum bicarbonate: 18 mmol/L - Sodium (Na): 135 mmol/L - Potassium (K): 5.5 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl): 110 mmol/L - Albumin: 1.2 g/dL Step 2: Calculate the anion gap (AG). The formula for the anion gap is: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Na} - (\text{Cl} + \text{HCO}_3) \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Step 3: Calculate the delta gap. The delta gap is defined as the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. The normal anion gap is typically around 8-16 mEq/L, but for simplicity, let's use the midpoint or a typical value of 12 mEq/L. So the delta gap is: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = \text{Measured Anion Gap} - \text{Normal Anion Gap} \] If we use the normal anion gap as 12 mEq/L: \[ \text{Delta Gap} = 7 - 12 = -5 \, \text{mEq/L} \] However, the term "albumin-corrected delta gap" is not a standard term. It seems like the task might be asking for the correction of the anion gap itself based on the albumin level. The formula to correct the anion gap for hypoalbuminemia is: \[ \text{Corrected Anion Gap} = \text{Measured Anion Gap} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] The normal albumin level is typically around 4 g/dL. The patient's albumin is 1.2 g/dL. So the correction is: \[ \text{Corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.2) \] Calculate the difference in albumin: \[ 4 - 1.2 = 2.8 \, \text{g/dL} \] Now multiply this difference by 2.5: \[ 2.5 \times 2.8 = 7 \] Add this to the measured anion gap: \[ \text{Corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 7 = 14 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, if we use the corrected anion gap to calculate the delta gap relative to the normal anion gap (12 mEq/L), we get: \[ \text{Delta Gap (corrected)} = \text{Corrected Anion Gap} - \text{Normal Anion Gap} = 14 - 12 = 2 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Thus, the albumin-corrected delta gap is 2 mEq/L. So the final answer is 2 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we first need to calculate the measured anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = Na - (Cl + HCO3). Using the given values: Na = 135 mmol/L, Cl = 110 mmol/L, and HCO3 = 18 mmol/L, we get: Anion Gap = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 mEq/L. Next, we correct the anion gap for the patient's low albumin level. The formula to correct the anion gap for hypoalbuminemia is: Corrected Anion Gap = Measured Anion Gap + 2.5 * (Normal Albumin - Patient's Albumin). The normal albumin level is approximately 4 g/dL, and the patient's albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Therefore, the difference in albumin is 4 - 1.2 = 2.8 g/dL. Applying the correction: Corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 2.5 * 2.8 = 7 + 7 = 14 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is typically around 12 mEq/L. The delta gap is the difference between the corrected anion gap and the normal anion gap: Delta Gap (corrected) = Corrected Anion Gap - Normal Anion Gap = 14 - 12 = 2 mEq/L. Therefore, the albumin-corrected delta gap is 2 mEq/L.", "answer": "2"}

He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Delta gap = serum bicarbonate - (Na + K - Cl).  \nCorrected for albumin: add 2.5 mEq per g/dL decrease?

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

History: typical chest pain? He had pleuritic chest pain, but not typical. Risk factors: diabetes, hypertension, smoking? not mentioned. Troponin: initial 0.481, >0.3?</think> Let's calculate the HEART score step by step. Step 1: History The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is not typical for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, the score for History is 0. Step 2: ECG The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. This does not indicate any significant ECG changes suggestive of ACS. Therefore, the score for ECG is 0. Step 3: Age The patient is 47 years old. Since he is under 65 years old, the score for Age is 0. Step 4: Risk factors The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Diabetes and hypertension are both risk factors for ACS. Therefore, the score for Risk factors is 1. Step 5: Troponin The initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml, which is elevated but it subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml. The HEART score uses the peak troponin level. Since the peak troponin was 0.481 ng/ml, and assuming the reference range is <0.012 ng/ml, this is elevated. However, the HEART score categorizes troponin as follows: - Troponin <0.04 ng/ml: 0 points - 0.04-0.39 ng/ml: 1 point - ≥0.4 ng/ml: 2 points Since the peak troponin was 0.481 ng/ml, which is ≥0.4 ng/ml, the score for Troponin is 2. Now, let's add up the scores from each component: - History: 0 - ECG: 0 - Age: 0 - Risk factors: 1 - Troponin: 2 Total HEART score = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, the patient's HEART score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HEART score, we need to evaluate the following components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin.\n\n1. **History**: The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath.

From 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is exactly one year. Since 2022 is not a leap year, the number of days from 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is 365 days. Now, we need to calculate the number of days from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023. Let's break it down month by month from October 1, 2023 to June 13, 2023: - October 2022: 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days (from 10/01 to 10/31) - November 2022: 30 days - December 2022: 31 days - January 2023: 31 days - February 2023: 28 days (since 2023 is not a leap year) - March 2023: 31 days - April 2023: 30 days - May 2023: 31 days - June 2023: 13 days (up to June 13) But actually, I'll calculate the total number of days from 10/01/2022 to 06/13/2023 directly. From 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is 365 days. Now, from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023: - October 2023: 0 days (since we're starting from the 1st of October) - November 2022: 30 days - December 2022: 31 days - January 2023: 31 days - February 2023: 28 days - March 2023: 31 days - April 2023: 30 days - May 2023: 31 days - June 2023: 13 days But I made an error in the approach. Let's calculate the total number of days from 10/01/2022 to 06/13/2023 step by step. From 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is 365 days. Then from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023: - October 2023: 0 days (since we're starting from the 1st of October) - November 2022: 30 days - December 2022: 31 days - January 2023: 31 days - February 2023: 28 days - March 2023: 31 days - April 2023: 30 days - May 2023: 31 days - June 2023: 13 days Adding these up: November: 30 days December: 31 days January: 31 days February: 28 days March: 31 days April: 30 days May: 31 days June: 13 days Total = 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 13 Let's add them step by step: 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 61 61 + 31 (January) = 92 92 + 28 (February) = 120 120 + 31 (March) = 151 151 + 30 (April) = 181 181 + 31 (May) = 212 212 + 13 (June up to 13th) = 225 So the total number of days from 10/01/2022 to 06/13/2023 is 365 (from 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023) + 225 (from 10/01/2023 to 06/13/2023). 365 + 225 = 590 days. Now, to convert 590 days into weeks and days for gestational age: Since 1 week = 7 days, we divide 590 by 7 to get the number of weeks and the remainder will give us the number of days. \[ 590 \div 7 = 84.2857 \] So, 590 days is 84 weeks plus some remainder days. To find the remainder: \[ 590 - (84 \times 7) = 590 - 588 = 2 \] Thus, 590 days is 84 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, the estimated gestational age is (84 weeks, 2 days). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP), which is 10/01/2022, and today's date, 06/13/2023. \n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days between 10/01/2022 and 06/13/2023.\n\nFrom 10/01/2022 to 10/01/2023 is exactly one year.
