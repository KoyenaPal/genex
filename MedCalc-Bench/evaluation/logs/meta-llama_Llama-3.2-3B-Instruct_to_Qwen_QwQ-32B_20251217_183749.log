 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

THINKING USED  To calculate the HAS-BLED score, we need to evaluate the patient's history for the following bleeding risk factors: - Hypertension - Altered mental status - Bleeding history or bleeding tendency - Labile INR - Gastrointestinal bleeding - Exsanguination or surgical bleeding - Local or intraocular bleeding - Neurological disorder <step1> The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step2> There is no mention of altered mental status, so we will not add any points for this category. <step3> The patient has a history of liver disease (ALD), which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step4> There is no mention of a bleeding history or bleeding tendency, so we will not add any points for this category. <step5> The patient's INR is consistently normal, which means he is not at risk for labile INR. So, we will not add any points for this category. <step6> There is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step7> There is no mention of exsanguination or surgical bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step8> There is no mention of local or intraocular bleeding, so we will not add any points for this category. <step9> The patient has a history of neurological disorder (renal impairment), which is a risk factor for bleeding. So, we will add 1 point to the score. <step10> Now, let's add up the points: 1 (hypertension) + 1 (liver disease) + 1 (renal impairment) = 3 points. <step11> The maximum HAS-BLED score is 9. Since the patient has 3 points, his HAS-BLED score is 3. <step12> Therefore, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

THINKING USED Step 1: Identify the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 2: Determine the patient's cholesterol levels. The patient's LDL is 107 mg/dL, HDL is 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 98 mg/dL. These values are not ideal, but they are not high enough to be considered significantly elevated. Step 3: Assess the patient's blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure is 131/83 mm Hg, which is slightly elevated but not significantly high. Step 4: Evaluate the patient's age and sex. The patient is a 50-year-old male, which puts him in a higher risk category for cardiovascular disease. Step 5: Consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of acute diverticulitis, which may be related to his smoking history, but it is not a direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 6: Calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score. The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following formula: Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x (age in years)) - (0.1 x (sex, 1 for male, 0 for female)) - (0.1 x (total cholesterol in mg/dL/100)) - (0.1 x (triglycerides in mg/dL/100)) - (0.1 x (diabetes, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (hypertension, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (peripheral artery disease, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (cardiovascular disease, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) Using the patient's values: Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x (50)) - (0.1 x 1) - (0.1 x 107) - (0.1 x 98) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) Risk Score = 10 - 5 - 1.07 - 0.98 - 0 Risk Score = 3.93

Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

<think>Step 1: Identify the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 2: Determine the patient's cholesterol levels. The patient's LDL is 107 mg/dL, HDL is 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 98 mg/dL. These values are not ideal, but they are not high enough to be considered significantly elevated. Step 3: Assess the patient's blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure is 131/83 mm Hg, which is slightly elevated but not significantly high. Step 4: Evaluate the patient's age and sex. The patient is a 50-year-old male, which puts him in a higher risk category for cardiovascular disease. Step 5: Consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of acute diverticulitis, which may be related to his smoking history, but it is not a direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Step 6: Calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score. The Framingham Risk Score is calculated using the following formula: Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x (age in years)) - (0.1 x (sex, 1 for male, 0 for female)) - (0.1 x (total cholesterol in mg/dL/100)) - (0.1 x (triglycerides in mg/dL/100)) - (0.1 x (diabetes, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (hypertension, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (peripheral artery disease, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) - (0.1 x (cardiovascular disease, 1 for yes, 0 for no)) Using the patient's values: Risk Score = 10 - (0.1 x (50)) - (0.1 x 1) - (0.1 x 107) - (0.1 x 98) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) - (0.1 x 0) Risk Score = 10 - 5 - 1.07 - 0.98 - 0 Risk Score = 3.93 </think>

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia. On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam. The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques (). A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male with a history of liver failure and immunocompromise presents to the emergency department with acute symptoms of lethargy and decreased appetite. Physical examination reveals tachycardia to 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, blood pressure registering at 135/75 mm Hg and a baseline temperature of 37.2°C. Neurological assessment demonstrates mild confusion, corresponding to a Glasgow Coma Score of 14. Blood tests reveal elevated creatinine levels at 3.8 mg/dL. Metabolic panel showed sodium at 138 and potassium at 4.5 mEq/L. The white blood cell count was 12,000 per µL, triggering concern for a possible infection. Hematocrit was just within normal range at 43 %. The patient had an arterial blood gas pH of 7.32 and a A-a-gradient of 364, with a supplementary FiO₂ of 55 %. This patient's acute renal failure symptomatology, alongside the history of severe organ failure and immunocompromised, mandate rigorous monitoring and urgent medical intervention.

THINKING USED  To calculate the APACHE II score, we need to assign points for each of the following categories: age, temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, arterial pH, serum sodium, serum potassium, creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and Glasgow Coma Score. We will then sum up the points for each category and add 4 to the result. 1. Age: The patient is 60 years old, so we assign 3 points for age (APACHE II scoring system). 2. Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C, which is normal, so we assign 0 points for temperature. 3. Mean arterial pressure: The patient's blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for mean arterial pressure. 4. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is 95 beats per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for heart rate. 5. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for respiratory rate. 6. Oxygenation: The patient's arterial blood gas pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, and the A-a-gradient is 364, which indicates severe hypoxemia. We assign 4 points for oxygenation. 7. Arterial pH: The patient's arterial pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, so we assign 2 points for arterial pH. 8. Serum sodium: The patient's serum sodium is 138 mEq/L, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for serum sodium. 9. Serum potassium: The patient's serum potassium is 4.5 mEq/L, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for serum potassium. 10. Creatinine: The patient's creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL, which indicates acute renal failure, so we assign 6 points for creatinine. 11.

Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male with a history of liver failure and immunocompromise presents to the emergency department with acute symptoms of lethargy and decreased appetite. Physical examination reveals tachycardia to 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, blood pressure registering at 135/75 mm Hg and a baseline temperature of 37.2°C. Neurological assessment demonstrates mild confusion, corresponding to a Glasgow Coma Score of 14. Blood tests reveal elevated creatinine levels at 3.8 mg/dL. Metabolic panel showed sodium at 138 and potassium at 4.5 mEq/L. The white blood cell count was 12,000 per µL, triggering concern for a possible infection. Hematocrit was just within normal range at 43 %. The patient had an arterial blood gas pH of 7.32 and a A-a-gradient of 364, with a supplementary FiO₂ of 55 %. This patient's acute renal failure symptomatology, alongside the history of severe organ failure and immunocompromised, mandate rigorous monitoring and urgent medical intervention.

<think> To calculate the APACHE II score, we need to assign points for each of the following categories: age, temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, arterial pH, serum sodium, serum potassium, creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and Glasgow Coma Score. We will then sum up the points for each category and add 4 to the result. 1. Age: The patient is 60 years old, so we assign 3 points for age (APACHE II scoring system). 2. Temperature: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C, which is normal, so we assign 0 points for temperature. 3. Mean arterial pressure: The patient's blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for mean arterial pressure. 4. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is 95 beats per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for heart rate. 5. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for respiratory rate. 6. Oxygenation: The patient's arterial blood gas pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, and the A-a-gradient is 364, which indicates severe hypoxemia. We assign 4 points for oxygenation. 7. Arterial pH: The patient's arterial pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, so we assign 2 points for arterial pH. 8.

Serum potassium: The patient's serum potassium is 4.5 mEq/L, which is elevated, so we assign 2 points for serum potassium. 10. Creatinine: The patient's creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL, which indicates acute renal failure, so we assign 6 points for creatinine. 11. Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is 43%, which is within normal limits, so we assign 0 points for hematocrit. 12. White blood cell count: The patient's white blood cell count is 12,000/µL, which indicates leukocytosis, so we assign 2 points for white blood cell count. 13.

Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 55.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 364. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 135.0 mm Hg = 95.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 95.0 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.

We know the patient's height is 77 inches, so we need to convert it to meters first. </think> Okay, let's start by recalling the BMI formula: BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]². The target BMI is given as 19.7, and the height is 77 inches. First, I need to convert the height from inches to meters because the standard BMI formula uses meters. I remember that 1 inch is equal to 0.0254 meters. So, multiplying 77 inches by 0.0254 should give the height in meters. Let me calculate that: 77 * 0.0254. Let me do the math here. 70 inches would be 1.778 meters, and 7 inches is 0.1778 meters, so total is 1.778 + 0.1778 = 1.9558 meters. Wait, actually, 77 * 0.0254. Let me compute that more accurately. 77 * 0.0254. Let's see, 70*0.0254 is 1.778, and 7*0.0254 is 0.1778. Adding them gives 1.778 + 0.1778 = 1.9558 meters. So the height in meters is approximately 1.9558 m. Next, we need to rearrange the BMI formula to solve for weight. The formula becomes weight = BMI * [height]^2. Plugging in the numbers: weight = 19.7 * (1.9558)^2. Let me compute the square of the height first. 1.9558 squared. Let me calculate that. 2 squared is 4, so this should be a bit less. Let's compute 1.9558 * 1.9558. Let's do 1.95 * 1.95 first, which is 3.8025. But since it's 1.9558, maybe more precise. Alternatively, using calculator steps: 1.9558 * 1.9558. Let me compute 1.9558 squared: First, 1.9558 * 1.9558. Let's break it down: 1.9558 * 1 = 1.9558 1.9558 * 0.9 = 1.76022 1.9558 * 0.05 = 0.09779 1.9558 * 0.0058 = approximately 0.01134 Adding those up? Wait, maybe a better way. Alternatively, (2 - 0.0442)^2 = 4 - 2*2*0.0442 + (0.0442)^2. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, just multiply step by step: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Multiply 1.9558 × 1.9558: First, 1 × 1.9558 = 1.9558 0.9 × 1.9558 = 1.76022 0.05 × 1.9558 = 0.09779 0.005 × 1.9558 = 0.009779 0.0008 × 1.9558 = 0.00156464 Adding all these together: 1.9558 + 1.76022 = 3.71602 3.71602 + 0.09779 = 3.81381 3.81381 + 0.009779 = 3.823589 3.823589 + 0.00156464 ≈ 3.82515364 Wait, that might not be the right approach. Maybe I should just do straight multiplication: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Let me write it as: 1.9558 × 1.9558 ----------- First, multiply 1.9558 by 8 (the last digit of the second number): 1.9558 × 8 = 15.6464 Then, 1.9558 × 5 (the next digit, which is the tenths place, so actually 5/10, so shifted one position): 1.9558 × 5 = 9.779, but since it's the 5 in the hundredths place? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, perhaps approximate. Alternatively, let me use a calculator step: 1.9558 squared is approximately (1.9558)^2. Let me compute 1.9558 * 1.9558: First, 1.9558 * 2 = 3.9116. Subtract 1.9558 * 0.0442 (since 2 - 0.0442 = 1.9558). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, use decimal multiplication: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Multiply 19558 × 19558, then adjust the decimal places. But that's too tedious. Alternatively, approximate: 1.9558 is approximately 1.956. So 1.956 squared is (2 - 0.044)^2 = 4 - 2*2*0.044 + (0.044)^2 ≈ 4 - 0.176 + 0.001936 ≈ 3.825936. So approximately 3.826 m². So, using that approximation, the height squared is about 3.826 m². Then, the weight would be 19.7 * 3.826. Let me compute that: 19.7 * 3.826. Let's break it down: 20 * 3.826 = 76.52 Subtract 0.3 * 3.826 = 1.1478 So 76.52 - 1.1478 = 75.3722 kg. Wait, but let me check again: Wait, 19.7 * 3.826: First, 10 * 3.826 = 38.26 9 * 3.826 = 34.434 0.7 * 3.826 = 2.6782 Adding those together: 38.26 + 34.434 = 72.694; 72.694 + 2.6782 = 75.3722 kg. So approximately 75.37 kg. But let me check if my height squared was accurate enough. Alternatively, let's recalculate the height in meters more precisely. 77 inches * 0.0254 m/inch. 77 * 0.0254: 70 * 0.0254 = 1.778 7 * 0.0254 = 0.1778 Total is 1.778 + 0.1778 = 1.9558 meters exactly. So that part is correct. Then, (1.9558)^2: Let me compute this more accurately: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Let me write it as (1.95 + 0.0058)^2 = (1.95)^2 + 2*1.95*0.0058 + (0.0058)^2 1.95 squared is 3.8025 2*1.95*0.0058 = 2 * 1.95 * 0.0058 = 3.9 * 0.0058 = 0.02262 0.0058 squared is 0.00003364 Adding them: 3.8025 + 0.02262 = 3.82512 + 0.00003364 ≈ 3.82515364 So, the square is approximately 3.82515 m². Then, 19.7 * 3.82515 =? Let me compute 19.7 * 3.82515: First, 20 * 3.82515 = 76.503 Subtract 0.3 * 3.82515 = 1.147545 So, 76.503 - 1.147545 = 75.355455 kg. So approximately 75.36 kg. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 75.36 kg. Depending on rounding conventions, maybe to one decimal or as a whole number. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can present it to one decimal place. Alternatively, maybe they want it rounded to the nearest whole number. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise steps. Let me do the exact calculation: Height in meters: 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 m. Height squared: (1.9558)^2 = 1.9558 * 1.9558. Let me compute this step by step: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Multiply 1.9558 × 1 = 1.9558 1.9558 × 0.9 = 1.76022 1.9558 × 0.05 = 0.09779 1.9558 × 0.005 = 0.009779 1.9558 × 0.0008 = 0.00156464 Wait, actually, breaking down 1.9558 into 1 + 0.9 + 0.05 + 0.005 + 0.0008 might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps better to do standard multiplication: 1.9558 × 1.9558 ----------- First, multiply 1.9558 by 8 (the last digit of the second number, which is 8 in the ten-thousandth place? Wait, actually, the second number is 1.9558, so the digits are 1, 9, 5, 5, 8. Let me write it as: 1.9558 × 1.9558 ------------ First, multiply 1.9558 by 8 (the 8 in the ten-thousandth place? Wait, actually, the second number is 1.9558, so each digit is: 1 (units place), 9 (tenths), 5 (hundredths), 5 (thousandths), 8 (ten-thousandths). So when multiplying, we need to consider each digit's place. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to treat them as whole numbers and then adjust the decimal. Let's consider 19558 * 19558, then divide by 10^8 (since each number has 4 decimal places, so total 8). But that's a big number. Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach here. Alternatively, accept that the approximate value is around 3.82515 m². So, using that, 19.7 * 3.82515 =? Let me compute 19.7 * 3.82515: First, 10 * 3.82515 = 38.2515 9 * 3.82515 = 34.42635 0.7 * 3.82515 = 2.677605 Adding them together: 38.2515 + 34.42635 = 72.67785; then +2.677605 = 75.355455 kg. So approximately 75.36 kg. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 75.36 kg. If we round to one decimal, it's 75.4 kg. But maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest whole number. Let me check the problem again. The question says "target weight in kg" without specifying, so perhaps we can present it to one decimal place. Alternatively, maybe they want an exact figure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps. Alternatively, let me verify using another method. Let me use the exact formula: Weight (kg) = BMI × (height in meters)^2 Height in meters: 77 inches × 0.0254 m/inch = 1.9558 m So, (1.9558)^2 = 1.9558 * 1.9558. Let me compute this precisely: 1.9558 × 1.9558: Let me compute 1.9558 × 1.9558: First, 1 × 1.9558 = 1.9558 0.9 × 1.9558 = 1.76022 0.05 × 1.9558 = 0.09779 0.005 × 1.9558 = 0.009779 0.0008 × 1.9558 = 0.00156464 Adding all these together: 1.9558 + 1.76022 = 3.71602 3.71602 + 0.09779 = 3.81381 3.81381 + 0.009779 = 3.823589 3.823589 + 0.00156464 = 3.82515364 So, the square is 3.82515364 m². Then, multiplying by 19.7: 19.7 × 3.82515364 Let me compute this step by step: First, 20 × 3.82515364 = 76.5030728 Subtract 0.3 × 3.82515364 = 1.147546092 So, 76.5030728 - 1.147546092 = 75.3555267 kg. So approximately 75.36 kg. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 75.36 kg. If we round to one decimal, it's 75.4 kg. Since the problem gives the BMI to one decimal (19.7), maybe the answer should also be to one decimal place. Alternatively, perhaps they want it as a whole number. Let me see if there's a standard practice here. Typically, weight is often rounded to the nearest tenth or whole number. Since the calculation gives 75.3555..., which is approximately 75.4 kg when rounded to one decimal. Alternatively, maybe they want it more precise. Let me check the exact value again. Alternatively, perhaps I should present the answer as 75.4 kg. But let me see if there's any possible miscalculation. Let me verify with another approach. Alternatively, using calculator input: Height in meters: 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 m. Height squared: 1.9558^2 = 3.82515364. Multiply by BMI 19.7: 19.7 * 3.82515364 =? Let me compute 19.7 * 3.82515364: 19 * 3.82515364 = 72.67791916 0.7 * 3.82515364 = 2.677607548 Adding them: 72.67791916 + 2.677607548 = 75.35552671 kg. So, exactly 75.35552671 kg. Rounding to two decimal places is 75.36 kg. To one decimal, 75.4 kg. Since the target BMI is given to one decimal, perhaps the answer should also be to one decimal. So 75.4 kg. Alternatively, maybe they want it as a whole number, so 75 kg. But 75.35 is closer to 75.4 than 75.0. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using a slightly different conversion factor? Let me confirm the inches to meters conversion. 1 inch is exactly 2.54 cm, so 0.0254 meters. So 77 inches * 0.0254 = 1.9558 m, which is correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a rounded height? For example, if they rounded the height to 1.96 m, then (1.96)^2 = 3.8416, then 19.7 * 3.8416 =? 19.7 * 3.8416: 20*3.8416=76.832, minus 0.3*3.8416=1.15248, so 76.832 -1.15248=75.67952, which would be ~75.7 kg. But that's different. But since the exact calculation gives 75.36, perhaps the precise answer is better. Alternatively, maybe I should present the exact value without rounding until the end. Since the problem didn't specify, but in medical contexts, sometimes they round to the nearest tenth. So 75.4 kg. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 75.4 kg. Let me check once more. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me recompute 19.7 * 3.82515364: Let me do 19.7 * 3.82515364: First, 10 * 3.82515364 = 38.2515364 9 * 3.82515364 = 34.42638276 0.7 * 3.82515364 = 2.677607548 Adding those three: 38.2515364 + 34.42638276 = 72.67791916 + 2.677607548 = 75.355526708 kg. Yes, so that's correct. So the precise value is approximately 75.36 kg. Depending on rounding, but since the question

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease. On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity. The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled.

To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each category. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of pain in patients with acute pancreatitis. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain. The patient's symptoms include: - Fever: The patient's temperature is not mentioned in the note, so we will assume it is normal (0 points). - Pain: The patient reports abdominal pain and sore mouth, but the endoscopy did not show evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations, or mild bulbar duodenitis. We will assign 3 points for moderate to severe distal esophagitis and pangastritis. - Inflammation: The patient has an elevated leukocyte count (18.9 × 10^3 K/mm^3) and gastric biopsy demonstrated acute inflammation and epithelial erosion, so we will assign 4 points for inflammation. - Nausea and vomiting: The patient reports nausea and vomiting, but the note mentions that he tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft, so we will assign 2 points for nausea and vomiting. - Age: The patient is 77 years old, which is a risk factor for pain, but we will assign 1 point for age. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score: FeverPAIN score = 0 (fever) + 3 (pain) + 4 (inflammation) + 2 (nausea and vomiting) + 1 (age) = 10

THINKING USED  To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, we need to follow these steps: 1. First, we need to convert the patient's heart rate from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bps). We can do this by dividing the heart rate by 60. 2. Next, we need to plug the values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = QT / sqrt(RR) * 1000, where QT is the patient's uncorrected QT interval in milliseconds, and RR is the patient's heart rate in seconds. 3. Now, we can plug in the values: QTc = 330 / sqrt(46/60) * 1000. 4. Calculate the square root of 46/60: sqrt(46/60) = sqrt(0.7667) = 0.875. 5. Now, we can calculate the corrected QT interval: QTc = 330 / 0.875 * 1000 = 378.286. 6. Round the result to the nearest whole number, as the corrected QT interval should be in milliseconds.

Round the result to the nearest whole number, as the corrected QT interval should be in milliseconds. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, first determine the RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 46 bpm, so the RR interval is 60/46 ≈ 1.304 seconds. The formula is QTc = QT / sqrt(RR). Plugging in the values: QTc = 330 / sqrt(1.304). Calculating sqrt(1.304) ≈ 1.142. Then, 330 / 1.142 ≈ 288.99. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Oh no, I made a mistake. The RR interval is actually the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds. So RR interval = 60 / heart rate (bpm). So 60 divided by 46 is approximately 1.304 seconds. Then sqrt(1.304) is about 1.142. So 330 divided by 1.142 equals approximately 288.99. But that would give a QTc of around 289, which is lower than the original QT of 330. That doesn't make sense because a slower heart rate should result in a longer QTc. Wait, maybe I inverted something. Let me recalculate. The formula is QTc = QT / sqrt(RR interval). The RR interval is the time between heartbeats, so for a heart rate of 46 bpm, the RR interval is 60/46 ≈ 1.304 seconds. So sqrt(1.304) ≈ 1.142. Then 330 divided by 1.142 is approximately 288.99. Hmm, but that would mean the corrected QT is shorter than the measured QT, which is counterintuitive because at lower heart rates, the QT interval should be longer when corrected. Maybe I made an error in the formula. Wait, the Bazett formula is QTc = QT / sqrt( RR interval ), where RR interval is in seconds. Let me confirm the formula again. Yes, that's correct. But if the heart rate is slow (46 bpm), the RR interval is longer (1.304 seconds), so the denominator becomes larger, so the corrected QT should be smaller? That contradicts my understanding. Wait, actually, when the heart rate is slower, the QT interval is naturally longer, but the correction formula adjusts it to what it would be at a normal heart rate. So if the heart rate is slow, the QT is longer, but the correction formula divides by a larger sqrt(RR), so the QTc would be lower? That seems conflicting. Let me think of an example. Suppose a normal QT is 400 ms at a heart rate of 60 (RR=1 sec). Then QTc would be 400 / 1 = 400. If the heart rate is 46, RR=1.304, so QTc would be 330 / sqrt(1.304) ≈ 330 / 1.142 ≈ 289. But the original QT is 330, so the corrected QT is lower? That would mean the QT is actually prolonged when corrected? Wait, maybe I have the formula backwards. Let me check the formula again. The Bazett formula is indeed QTc = QT / sqrt( RR interval ). So if the RR interval is longer (slower heart rate), the denominator increases, so the QTc decreases. That would mean that a longer QT at a slow heart rate is actually a normal QTc. But in this case, the patient's QT is 330, which is already quite long. Let me see: if the heart rate is 46, RR interval is 1.304 seconds. So sqrt(1.304) is ~1.142. 330 divided by 1.142 is approximately 289. So the corrected QT would be 289, which is within the normal range (normal QTc is typically <450, but more strictly <440 or <470 depending on the source). Wait, but 289 is actually lower than the original QT. That suggests that the patient's QT is prolonged because when corrected, it's still within normal? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me check again. The Bazett formula is QTc = QT interval divided by the square root of the RR interval. The RR interval is in seconds. So yes, the steps are correct. So with QT=330 and RR=1.304, the calculation is 330 / sqrt(1.304) ≈ 330 / 1.142 ≈ 289. So the corrected QT is approximately 289 msec. But the question is asking for the corrected QT interval using the formula, so the answer is 289. However, I need to ensure that the calculation is accurate. Let me compute sqrt(1.304) more precisely. 1.142 squared is 1.304 (since 1.142^2 = 1.304). So 330 divided by 1.142 is exactly 330 / 1.142. Let me compute that: 1.142 * 289 = 1.142 * 280 = 320, plus 1.142*9=10.278, total 330.278. So 1.142 * 289 ≈ 330.278, so 330 /1.142 ≈ 289. So the answer is approximately 289. But maybe I should use more precise decimal places. Let me compute sqrt(60/46). 60 divided by 46 is exactly 1.304347826. The square root of that is sqrt(1.304347826). Let me calculate that: sqrt(1.304347826). Let's see, 1.14 squared is 1.2996, 1.142 squared is 1.304. So sqrt(1.304347826) is approximately 1.142. So the calculation holds. Therefore, the corrected QT is approximately 289 msec. But wait, the original QT is 330, which is already quite long. However, when corrected for the slow heart rate, it becomes 289, which is within normal range. That makes sense because at a slower heart rate, the QT naturally lengthens, so the correction adjusts it to what it would be at a normal heart rate. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 289 msec. But let me check once more. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the formula to be QTc = QT / sqrt( (60 / HR) ). Since HR is 46, so RR interval is 60/46. So yes, that's exactly what I did. So the steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer is approximately 289 msec. But let me confirm with precise calculation: 330 divided by sqrt(60/46). Let me compute sqrt(60/46) first. 60 divided by 46 is approximately 1.304347826. The square root of that is approximately 1.142. So 330 divided by 1.142 equals 289.0. So the answer is 289 msec. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, first determine the RR interval in seconds.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The correct formula might be using 0.02 instead of 0.8. Let me check again. The standard formula is: Corrected Ca = Measured Ca + (4.0 - Albumin) * 0.8. Wait no, actually the correct formula is: Corrected Ca = Measured Ca + (Normal Albumin - Measured Albumin) * 0.8. Wait, no, different sources say different things. Some use 0.8 mg/dL per g/dL of albumin below 4, others use 0.02. Let me confirm. The standard formula is: Corrected Ca (mg/dL) = Measured Ca + 0.8 * (4.0 - Albumin (g/dL)). So if albumin is 3.2, then 4-3.2=0.8. 0.8*0.8=0.64. 7.2+0.64=7.84. Alternatively, another formula is: Corrected Ca = Measured Ca + (4 - Albumin) * 0.2. Wait, confusion between different units? Let me check. The correct formula is: For every 1 g/dL decrease in albumin below 4 g/dL, add 0.8 mg/dL to the measured calcium. So yes, 7.2 + (4-3.2)*0.8 = 7.2 + 0.64 = 7.84 mg/dL. But the user specified to set normal albumin to 4 g/dL. So the answer should be 7.84. Wait, but in some references, the formula is: Corrected Ca = Measured Ca + (0.8 × (4.0 - Albumin)). So that's the same as above. Therefore, the corrected calcium is 7.84 mg/dL. However, I need to ensure that the formula is correctly applied.

{'Row Number': 108, 'Calculator Name': 'Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia', 'Calculator ID': '7', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-8342167-1', 'Patient Note': "A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.
In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.
On March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung. Thus, the classification was PD, and the patient failed to respond to two lines of therapy.

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.\nThe patient had no medical history of past illness.\nThe patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.\nThe height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.\nIn July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.\nOn March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung.

I think I made a mistake here. Let me check the conversion factors again. OxyCODONE's conversion factor is 1.5 mg of OxyCODONE equals 1 mg of Morphine. So 60 mg of OxyCODONE would be 60 * 1.5 = 90 MME. HYDROmorphone's conversion factor is 1 mg = 4 mg MME. So 70 mg twice a day: 70 * 4 = 280 MME per dose, but wait, the patient takes it 2 times a day. Wait, the note says 70 mg 2 times a day? That seems extremely high. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The note says "70 mg of HYDROmorphone 2 times a day". That's 70 mg per dose? That's way too high because typical doses for HYDROmorphone are much lower. Maybe it's a typo? But assuming the numbers are correct as given, then each dose is 70 mg. So 70 mg * 2 doses = 140 mg daily. Then converting to MME: 140 mg * 4 = 560 MME. Codeine's conversion factor is 1 mg = 0.03 MME. So 10 mg twice a day is 20 mg daily. 20 * 0.03 = 0.6 MME. Now adding all together: OxyCODONE (90) + HYDROmorphone (560) + Codeine (0.6) = 650.6 MME. Wait, but I might have messed up the conversion factors. Let me confirm the standard conversion factors again. According to CDC guidelines: - OxyCODONE: 1 mg = 1.5 MME - HYDROmorphone: 1 mg = 4 MME - Codeine: 1 mg = 0.03 MME So recapping: OxyCODONE: 60 mg/day * 1.5 = 90 MME HYDROmorphone: 70 mg/dose * 2 doses = 140 mg/day * 4 = 560 MME Codeine: 10 mg/dose * 2 = 20 mg/day * 0.03 = 0.6 MME Total MME: 90 + 560 + 0.6 = 650.6 MME. But the HYDROmorphone dose seems extremely high. 70 mg twice daily is 140 mg/day, which is way beyond typical therapeutic doses. Maybe the user meant 7 mg twice a day? But the question states 70 mg. Since the task is to calculate based on the given numbers, I have to proceed with the provided values. Therefore, the total MME is 650.6, which rounds to 651 MME. However, sometimes MME is rounded to the nearest whole number. So the answer should be 651. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "1. Convert each medication to MME using standard conversion factors:\n- OxyCODONE: 60 mg/day × 1.5 = 90 MME\n- HYDROmorphone: 70 mg/dose × 2 doses/day = 140 mg/day × 4 = 560 MME\n- Codeine: 10 mg/dose × 2 doses/day = 20 mg/day × 0.03 = 0.6 MME\n2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

The patient is a 73-year-old African American woman. Her serum creatinine is mentioned as elevated, and in the initial lab results, it's listed as 7.3 mg/dL. Wait, actually, looking back, the initial labs show elevated creatinine, and later when her renal function worsened, the creatinine was 8 mg/dL. The question is asking for the GFR using the MDRD equation. The MDRD equation requires the serum creatinine at the time of calculation. The problem might be referring to the initial creatinine of 7.3 mg/dL or the later 8 mg/dL. Let me check the task again. The task says "using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's GFR in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?" The note mentions that the vitamin D was measured when creatinine was 8 mg/dL. But the initial creatinine was 7.3. Since the question doesn't specify a particular time point, maybe we should use the initial value? Wait, the problem might be expecting the GFR at the time of admission or when the labs were first taken. Let me re-read the note. The initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL. Then later, after 24 hours, her kidney functions worsened, and her creatinine was 8 mg/dL. The task doesn't specify which value to use. Hmm. Since the question is part of the case study, perhaps the initial creatinine is the one to use for the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using the 8 mg/dL because that's when the renal function was most impaired, but the task might just want the GFR based on the initial data. Wait, the problem says "using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's GFR..." without specifying a time, so perhaps we need to use the first available creatinine value mentioned, which is 7.3 mg/dL. Let me confirm the exact numbers again. The initial labs: "elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL". Wait, the corrected calcium is 7.3, but the creatinine is elevated. Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check again. The note says: "Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits." Wait, that's ambiguous. Is the 7.3 mg/dL the corrected calcium or the creatinine? The sentence structure says "elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL". So the corrected calcium is 7.3, and the creatinine is elevated but the exact value isn't given here. Wait, that's a problem. The initial creatinine value isn't explicitly stated here. Wait, maybe I need to look again. The note says "elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL". So the corrected calcium is 7.3, but the creatinine's value isn't provided here. Then later, when her renal function worsened, the creatinine was 8 mg/dL. The problem might be expecting us to use the 8 mg/dL value because that's the one mentioned in the context where the vitamin D was measured. Alternatively, perhaps the initial creatinine is missing, but maybe the question expects using the 8 mg/dL. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the note's transcription? Let me check again. Wait, the initial labs: "elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL". So the corrected calcium is 7.3, but the creatinine's value isn't given. The next part says "Ten days prior..." and then later, "the value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL)". So the creatinine at the time of the vitamin D test was 8. But the initial creatinine isn't specified. Hmm, this is a problem. The question is asking for the GFR using MDRD, but without the exact creatinine value from the initial labs, unless the 7.3 is the creatinine. Wait, maybe I misread the sentence. Let me parse it again: "elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL". The "of 7.3mg/dL" is attached to corrected calcium, so the creatinine is elevated but the number isn't given. That's an issue. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo and the corrected calcium is 7.3, and the creatinine is another value. But since the question is about GFR, which requires creatinine, maybe the 8 mg/dL is the one to use. Since the problem is presented in the context of the case, perhaps the intended value is 8 mg/dL. Alternatively, maybe the initial creatinine was 7.3, but that's the calcium. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me see if there's another mention of creatinine. The note says "her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL)." So the creatinine at the time of the vitamin D test was 8. The initial creatinine was elevated but not specified. Since the question is part of the case, maybe the intended creatinine value is 8 mg/dL. Alternatively, perhaps the initial creatinine was 7.3, but that's the calcium. Since the question is about GFR, which requires creatinine, and the only explicit creatinine value given is 8 mg/dL, I think we should use that. The problem might be expecting that. Let's proceed with 8 mg/dL as the creatinine. Now, the MDRD equation requires the serum creatinine in mg/dL. The formula is: GFR = 186 × (Scr)^-1.154 × (Age)^-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.210 if African American) The patient is female, African American, age 73. Plugging in the numbers: Scr = 8 mg/dL Age = 73 So: First, calculate (Scr)^-1.154: 8^-1.154. Let me compute that. Let me see, 8^1 =8, 8^1.154 is 8^(1 + 0.154) = 8 * 8^0.154. Let me approximate. Alternatively, using a calculator: 8^-1.154 ≈ 1/(8^1.154). Let me compute 8^1.154. Let's see, ln(8) is about 2.079. Multiply by 1.154: 2.079 *1.154 ≈ 2.402. Exponentiate: e^2.402 ≈ 11.07. So 8^1.154 ≈11.07, so 8^-1.154 ≈1/11.07 ≈0.0903. Then, (Age)^-0.203 = 73^-0.203. Let's compute ln(73) ≈4.290. Multiply by -0.203: 4.290 * -0.203 ≈-0.871. Exponentiate: e^-0.871 ≈0.418. Now, multiply all factors: 186 × 0.0903 × 0.418 × 0.742 × 1.210. Let me compute step by step: First, 186 × 0.0903 ≈186 *0.09 =16.74, plus 186*0.0003=0.0558 → total ≈16.7958. Next, multiply by 0.418: 16.7958 *0.418 ≈16.7958*0.4=6.718, 16.7958*0.018≈0.302, total ≈7.02. Then multiply by 0.742: 7.02 *0.742 ≈5.207. Then multiply by 1.210: 5.207 *1.21 ≈6.30. So approximately 6.3 mL/min/1.73m². Wait, but let me check the calculations again for accuracy. Maybe I made an error in exponents. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator for precise computation: First, let's recalculate 8^-1.154: Using a calculator: 8^1.154. Let me compute 8^1 =8, 8^0.154. Let me compute log base 10: log10(8)=0.903. 0.154 *0.903 ≈0.139. So 10^0.139 ≈1.376. So 8^0.154≈1.376. Thus 8^1.154=8*1.376≈11.008. So 8^-1.154≈1/11.008≈0.0908. Then 73^-0.203: Let's compute 73^0.203 first. Let me use natural logs again. ln(73)=4.290. 0.203*4.290≈0.875. e^0.875≈2.399. So 73^0.203≈2.399, so 73^-0.203≈1/2.399≈0.417. So now: 186 *0.0908 =186*0.09=16.74 +186*0.0008=0.1488 → total 16.8888. 16.8888 *0.417 ≈16.8888*0.4=6.7555 +16.8888*0.017≈0.287 → total ≈7.0425. 7.0425 *0.742 (female factor) =7.0425*0.7=4.92975 +7.0425*0.042≈0.2958 → total≈5.2256. 5.2256 *1.21 (African American) =5.2256*1.2=6.2707 +5.2256*0.01=0.052256 → total≈6.3229. So approximately 6.32 mL/min/1.73m². Rounding to one decimal, maybe 6.3. But sometimes GFR is rounded to the nearest whole number. So about 6 mL/min/1.73m². Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise exponent calculations. Let me try using an online calculator for the MDRD formula. Wait, but since I can't access that, I'll proceed with the approximate value. Alternatively, maybe the initial creatinine was 7.3, but that was the calcium. Since the question is part of the case, perhaps the intended creatinine is 8 mg/dL as that's the value when renal function was most impaired, and the question might expect that. So the answer would be approximately 6 mL/min/1.73m². </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's GFR using the MDRD equation, the required parameters are serum creatinine, age, sex, and race.

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

THINKING USED  To find the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L, we need to first find the patient's sodium concentration in terms of mg/dL and then convert it to mEq/L. The patient's sodium concentration was 136 mmol/L, which is equivalent to 136 mg/dL. To convert mg/dL to mEq/L, we need to divide the value in mg/dL by 39 (since 1 mEq = 39 mg). So, the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L is 136 mg/dL / 39 = 3.46 mEq/L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.

THINKING USED Step 1: Understand the patient's medical history and current condition. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She was recently diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the right great toe and underwent surgery for amputation. She was also started on nafcillin, which was discontinued due to suspected drug-related hepatic injury. Step 2: Identify the relevant laboratory values. The patient's laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. These values indicate liver damage and cholestasis. Step 3: Analyze the patient's liver function tests. The patient's liver function tests show a range of abnormal values, including elevated AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP, as well as elevated bilirubin levels. These values suggest liver damage and cholestasis. Step 4: Determine the patient's delta ratio. The delta ratio is not explicitly defined in the provided text. However, based on the context, it is likely that the delta ratio refers to the difference between the patient's current liver function tests and her baseline values. To calculate the delta ratio, we need to compare the patient's current values to her baseline values. Step 5: Calculate the delta ratio. To calculate the delta ratio, we need to compare the patient's current values to her baseline values. However, the baseline values are not explicitly provided. We can assume that the baseline values are the values from the patient's initial laboratory evaluation, which were: * AST: 8 IU/L * ALT: 9 IU/L * ALP: 78 IU/L * GGTP: 878 IU/L * Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL Using these values, we can calculate the delta ratio as follows: * AST: 152 IU/L - 8 IU/L = 144 IU/L * ALT: 85 IU/L - 9 IU/L = 76 IU/L * ALP: 1800 IU/L - 78 IU/L = 1722 IU/L * GGTP: 1500 IU/L - 878 IU/L = 622 IU/L * Bilirubin: 11.5 mg/dL - 0.3 mg/dL = 11.2 mg/dL The delta ratio is a measure of the change in liver function tests over time. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect any changes in liver function. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's delta ratio is calculated by comparing the current values to the baseline values. The delta ratio for each liver enzyme is as follows: AST (144 IU/L), ALT (76 IU/L), ALP (1722 IU/L), GGTP (622 IU/L), and bilirubin (11.2 mg/dL).", "answer": "AST: 144 IU/L, ALT: 76 IU/L, ALP: 1722 IU/L, GGTP: 622 IU/L, bilirubin: 11.2 mg/dL"}

Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative.

We can assume that the baseline values are the values from the patient\'s initial laboratory evaluation, which were: * AST: 8 IU/L * ALT: 9 IU/L * ALP: 78 IU/L * GGTP: 878 IU/L * Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL Using these values, we can calculate the delta ratio as follows: * AST: 152 IU/L - 8 IU/L = 144 IU/L * ALT: 85 IU/L - 9 IU/L = 76 IU/L * ALP: 1800 IU/L - 78 IU/L = 1722 IU/L * GGTP: 1500 IU/L - 878 IU/L = 622 IU/L * Bilirubin: 11.5 mg/dL - 0.3 mg/dL = 11.2 mg/dL The delta ratio is a measure of the change in liver function tests over time. It can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect any changes in liver function. {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient\'s delta ratio is calculated by comparing the current values to the baseline values.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

The albumin-corrected anion gap is 22.227 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L.

The Fridericia Formula is as follows: QTc = QT / √(1 + (1/1000 * HR)) where QTc is the corrected QT interval, QT is the measured QT interval, and HR is the heart rate. </think> Wait, actually, I should double-check the exact formula. Let me recall. The Fridericia correction formula is QTcF = QT interval divided by the cube root of the heart rate (HR) in beats per minute. Wait, no, maybe it's the square root? Hmm, I need to confirm. Wait, no, Fridericia's formula uses the cube root of the RR interval, which is the inverse of the heart rate. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of heart rate. Let me think again. The standard formula is QTc = QT / (RR interval)^1/3. But since the RR interval is the time between QRS complexes, which is 60 divided by the heart rate (HR). So RR interval in seconds would be 60/HR. Therefore, the formula can be written as QTc = QT / ( (60/HR)^ (1/3) ). Alternatively, sometimes people approximate it using the square root, but Fridericia specifically uses the cube root. Wait, perhaps the formula is written as QTcF = QT / (HR/1000)^(1/3). Let me check the exact formula again. Alternatively, maybe the formula is QTc = QT / (RR interval)^1/3, where RR interval is in seconds. Since RR interval is 60/HR, so substituting that in, the formula becomes QTc = QT / ( (60/HR)^(1/3) ). Given that the patient's heart rate is 164 bpm, so HR = 164. The QT interval is 330 msec. First, compute the RR interval: 60 divided by 164. Let me calculate that. 60 / 164 ≈ 0.36585 seconds. Then take the cube root of that value. The cube root of 0.36585. Let me compute that. The cube root of 0.36585 is approximately 0.715 (since 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.715^3 ≈ 0.367). Then divide the QT interval by this cube root value. So 330 divided by 0.715 ≈ 461.46 msec. Wait, but let me do the exact calculation step by step. First, compute RR interval in seconds: 60 / 164 = 0.3658536585 seconds. Cube root of 0.3658536585: Let me use a calculator approach. Let me compute 0.36585^(1/3). Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as QTc = QT / (HR/1000)^(1/3). Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me confirm the exact formula again. According to standard references, Fridericia's formula is indeed QTc = QT / (RR interval)^1/3, where RR interval is in seconds. Since RR interval is 60/HR, so substituting that in, the formula becomes QTc = QT / ( (60/HR)^(1/3) ). So plugging in the numbers: QT = 330 msec HR = 164 bpm Compute RR interval: 60 / 164 ≈ 0.36585 seconds Cube root of 0.36585: Let me compute this more precisely. Let me note that 0.36585^(1/3). Let me see: Let me try 0.715^3: 0.715 * 0.715 = 0.511225, then *0.715 ≈ 0.511225 * 0.715 ≈ 0.3658. Oh, exactly! So 0.715^3 = 0.3658, so the cube root of 0.3658 is 0.715. Therefore, the cube root of 0.36585 is approximately 0.715. Therefore, QTc = 330 / 0.715 ≈ 461.46 msec. Rounding to the nearest whole number, that would be approximately 461 msec. Wait, but maybe the calculation should be done with more precise steps. Let me check again: Cube root of (60/164): 60 divided by 164 is exactly 0.36585365853658536... Cube root of that is exactly 0.715, as 0.715^3 = 0.3658536585. So that's precise. Therefore, 330 divided by 0.715 equals exactly 461.4609727... So approximately 461.5, but since QTc is usually rounded to the nearest whole number, it would be 461 or 462. Depending on rounding conventions, perhaps 461.5 would round to 462. But maybe the question expects the exact value without rounding? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. Wait, another way to write Fridericia's formula is QTcF = QT / (HR/1000)^(1/3). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me confirm. Wait, actually, the formula is often written as QTc = QT / (RR interval)^1/3, where RR interval is in seconds. Since RR interval is 60/HR, so substituting that in, the formula is correct as above. Alternatively, some sources might present the formula using HR directly. Let me see. Suppose someone uses the formula as QTc = QT / ( (HR/1000)^(1/3) ), but that would be incorrect because HR is in bpm, not in seconds. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as QTc = QT / ( (RR interval in seconds)^(1/3) ), so the steps are correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 461.5 msec, which would be rounded to 462 msec. But maybe the question expects the exact value without rounding. Let me see the problem again. The question says "what is the patient's corrected QT interval in terms of msec?" It doesn't specify rounding, so perhaps we can present it to one decimal place, but typically QTc is reported as an integer. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is presented differently. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula is written as QTc = QT / ( (1/HR)^0.333 ), but that's the same as above. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as QTc = QT / ( (60/HR)^0.3333 ). So, using the given numbers: HR = 164, so 60/164 ≈ 0.36585 Cube root of 0.36585 is 0.715, so 330 divided by 0.715 is 461.46. Therefore, the answer is approximately 461 msec when rounded to the nearest whole number. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different formula? Let me confirm once again. Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as QTc = QT / (HR/1000)^(1/3). Wait, but that would be incorrect because HR is in bpm, so HR/1000 is a very small number. Wait, perhaps the formula is written as QTc = QT / ( (RR interval in seconds)^(1/3) ), which is the correct approach. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the final answer is approximately 461 msec. Wait, but let me check with precise calculation. Let me compute 330 divided by 0.715 exactly. 330 / 0.715 =? 0.715 × 460 = 0.715 × 400 = 286, plus 0.715 ×60 = 42.9 → total 286 +42.9 = 328.9. So 0.715 × 460 = 328.9. 330 - 328.9 = 1.1. So 1.1 /0.715 ≈ 1.538. So total is 460 + 1.538 ≈ 461.538, so approximately 461.54. Therefore, rounding to the nearest whole number, it's 462. Hmm, so depending on rounding, it could be 461 or 462. But perhaps the question expects the exact value without rounding, so 461.5, but since it's in msec, maybe they want an integer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the cube root calculation. Let me verify with a calculator. Cube root of 0.3658536585: Let me compute 0.715^3: 0.715 × 0.715 = 0.511225 0.511225 × 0.715 = 0.5 × 0.715 = 0.3575 0.011225 × 0.715 ≈ 0.00804 Total ≈ 0.3575 + 0.00804 ≈ 0.36554, which is very close to 0.36585. So the cube root is indeed approximately 0.715. Therefore, 330 divided by 0.715 is exactly 461.4609727, so approximately 461.5. Since the question asks for the answer in msec, and typically QTc is reported as an integer, so rounding to the nearest whole number would give 461 or 462. But perhaps the standard practice is to round to the nearest whole number, so 461.5 would round to 462. Alternatively, maybe the formula is presented differently. Let me check an example. Suppose HR is 60, then RR interval is 1 second. Then QTc would be QT / 1^(1/3) = QT. So if QT is 440, then QTc is 440. Another example: if HR is 120, RR interval is 0.5 seconds. Cube root of 0.5 is approximately 0.7937. So QTc = QT / 0.7937. So the formula seems correct. Therefore, in this case, the answer is approximately 461.5, so 462 when rounded. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer to one decimal place, so 461.5. But the question says "in terms of msec", which is an integer. Hmm. Since the problem might expect the precise calculation without rounding, perhaps they want the exact value, so 461.5, but since it's msec, maybe they want it as an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. Wait, according to the formula from Wikipedia: Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT / (RR interval)^1/3, where RR interval is in seconds. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is approximately 461.5, which would be 462 when rounded. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer to be presented as 461.5, but since it's a score, perhaps they want an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I should present the exact value as 461.5, but the problem might expect rounding. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the cube root calculation. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me compute the cube root of 0.3658536585. Let me use logarithms. Take natural log of 0.3658536585: ln(0.36585) ≈ -1.008. Divide by 3: -1.008 /3 ≈ -0.336. Exponentiate: e^(-0.336) ≈ 0.714. So that's consistent with 0.715. Therefore, the cube root is approximately 0.714, so 330 /0.714 ≈ 462. Wait, 0.714 × 462 = 0.714 × 400 = 285.6, plus 0.714 ×62 = 44.388 → total 285.6 +44.388 = 329.988, which is close to 330. Therefore, 0.714 ×462 ≈ 330, so 330 /0.714 ≈462. Therefore, the answer is 462 msec. Therefore, the correct answer is 462. Wait, but let me check with precise calculation: Cube root of (60/164): 60 divided by 164 is exactly 0.36585365853658536... Cube root of that is: Let me use a calculator for precise calculation. Using a calculator, cube root of 0.3658536585 is approximately 0.7148. Therefore, 330 divided by 0.7148 is: 330 /0.7148 ≈ 461.6. So approximately 461.6, which rounds to 462. Therefore, the answer is 462 msec. So the step-by-step is: 1. Calculate RR interval: 60 / HR = 60 /164 ≈0.36585 seconds. 2. Compute the cube root of the RR interval: (0.36585)^(1/3) ≈0.7148. 3. Divide the QT interval by this value: 330 /0.7148 ≈461.6. 4. Round to the nearest whole number: 462 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

The uncorrected anion gap is calculated as follows: uncorrected anion gap = (sodium + chloride) - (chloride + bicarbonate) Given values: - Sodium = 139 mEq/L - Chloride = 102 mEq/L - Bicarbonate = 30 mEq/L uncorrected anion gap = (139 + 102) - (102 + 30) uncorrected anion gap = 241 - 132 uncorrected anion gap = 109 mEq/L Next, we need to calculate the albumin corrected anion gap. The formula for this is: uncorrected anion gap - albumin Given albumin = 1.5 g/dL uncorrected anion gap - albumin = 109 - 1.5 uncorrected anion gap - albumin = 107.5 mEq/L </think> Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. The standard anion gap is calculated as (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-). But since K+ is not provided, it's often approximated as (Na+) - (Cl- + HCO3-). Let me confirm the correct formula. The standard formula is indeed (Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3). However, since K is not listed here, maybe the question expects using Na only. Let me recalculate using the standard approach without K. So, the anion gap is (Na) - (Cl + HCO3). Plugging in the numbers: 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 mEq/L. Wait, that's a big difference. Hmm, so I must have messed up the initial calculation. Let me start over. The correct formula for anion gap is: Anion Gap = Sodium (Na) - (Chloride (Cl) + Bicarbonate (HCO3)). The patient's values are: Na = 139, Cl = 102, HCO3 = 30. So, 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 mEq/L. Then, the albumin-corrected anion gap is calculated by adding 2.5 mEq/L for every 1 g/dL decrease in albumin below the normal level. The normal albumin is typically around 3.5-5.0 g/dL. The patient's albumin is 1.5 g/dL. The difference is 3.5 - 1.5 = 2 g/dL below normal. So, the correction is 2.5 * 2 = 5 mEq/L. Therefore, corrected anion gap = uncorrected (7) + 5 = 12 mEq/L. Wait, but some sources say the formula is (Na - (Cl + HCO3)) + (0.25 * (normal albumin - patient albumin)). Let me confirm the exact formula. The albumin correction formula is: Corrected Anion Gap = Unadjusted Anion Gap + (2.5 × (Normal Albumin Level - Patient's Albumin Level)). Normal albumin is usually 4.0 g/dL. If the patient's albumin is below normal, the anion gap is corrected by adding 2.5 for each gram below. So, if normal is 4.0, patient has 1.5, difference is 2.5 g/dL. 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25. Then corrected AG = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25. But different sources might use different normal albumin values. Let me check the note again. The albumin is 1.5 g/dL. The normal range for albumin is typically 3.5-5.0 g/dL. So, the difference is 3.5 - 1.5 = 2.0 g/dL. So, 2.0 * 2.5 = 5.0. So corrected AG = 7 +5 =12. Alternatively, if the normal albumin is taken as 4.0, then 4-1.5=2.5, so 2.5*2.5=6.25. Hmm, this discrepancy is confusing. Let me see what the standard approach is. According to UpToDate, the formula is: Corrected anion gap = unadjusted anion gap + (2.5 × (4.0 - albumin)). So using 4.0 as normal. So here, 4.0 -1.5 =2.5. 2.5*2.5=6.25. So corrected AG is 7 +6.25=13.25. But the question says "albumin corrected anion gap". The standard formula is indeed AG + 2.5*(4 - albumin). So let's proceed with that. So first, unadjusted AG is 7. Albumin is 1.5. 4-1.5=2.5. 2.5*2.5=6.25. So corrected AG is 7 +6.25=13.25, which rounds to 13.3. But maybe they want it as a whole number? Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using the formula where the correction is 2.5*(normal albumin - patient albumin). If the normal albumin is 4, then yes. So the answer would be 13.25, which is approximately 13.3. But let me check the numbers again. The sodium is 139, chloride 102, bicarbonate 30. So AG is 139 - (102+30)=7. Then correction: 4-1.5=2.5. 2.5*2.5=6.25. Total corrected AG is 7+6.25=13.25. So the answer is 13.3 or 13.25. But maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest whole number, so 13. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial AG calculation. Let me confirm once more. Sodium is 139, chloride 102, bicarbonate 30. AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3) = 139 - (102+30)=139-132=7. Correct. Then the correction is 2.5*(4-1.5)=6.25. So total is 13.25. The question asks for the albumin corrected anion gap. So the answer is 13.25 mEq/L, which can be written as 13.3 or rounded to 13. But maybe the question expects the uncorrected AG? Wait, no, the question specifically asks for the albumin corrected anion gap. So the correct answer is 13.25, which would be 13.3 when rounded to one decimal place. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 2.5*(3.5 - albumin) if the normal lower limit is 3.5. Let me see. If the normal albumin is considered 3.5, then 3.5-1.5=2.0. 2.0*2.5=5. So corrected AG is 7+5=12. So depending on the reference range used for albumin, the answer could vary. Since the problem doesn't specify, but in most clinical settings, the formula uses 4.0 as the normal albumin. Therefore, the answer is 13.25, which would be 13.3. However, the question might expect the uncorrected AG plus the correction. Let me check the exact formula again. The formula is: Corrected Anion Gap = Unadjusted Anion Gap + (2.5 × (4.0 - Albumin)). So yes, 4.0 is standard. Therefore, 13.25. Since the question asks for the answer in mEq/L, perhaps they want it as a whole number, so 13. But maybe they want the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial AG calculation. Let me check again. Sodium is 139, chloride 102, bicarbonate 30. So 139 - (102 +30)=7. Correct. Then correction is 2.5*(4-1.5)=6.25. So total is 13.25. So the answer is 13.25, which can be written as 13.3. But the question might expect rounding to the nearest whole number, so 13. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the uncorrected anion gap? Wait, no, the question specifically says "albumin corrected anion gap". Therefore, the correct answer is 13.25, which would be 13.3 when rounded to one decimal place. However, in some cases, the correction is done by adding 2.5 for each gram below 4.0. Since the patient is 2.5 grams below (4-1.5=2.5), so 2.5*2.5=6.25. So total is 7+6.25=13.25. So the answer is 13.25 mEq/L. But the question might want it as a whole number, so 13. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me check another source. According to some sources, the formula is: Corrected AG = AG + (2.5 × (4.0 - Albumin)). So yes, that's the standard. Therefore, the answer is 13.25. Since the question asks for the answer in mEq/L, perhaps they want it as 13.3. But maybe the question expects the uncorrected AG? Wait, no, the question specifies "albumin corrected". So the answer is 13.25. But in the note, the albumin is 1.5 g/dL. The calculation is correct. So the final answer is 13.25, which can be written as 13.3. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the uncorrected anion gap? Let me check the question again. The question says: "What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?" So definitely the corrected one. Therefore, the answer is 13.25, which would be 13.3 when rounded to one decimal place. However, in some cases, the correction is done by adding 2.5*(normal albumin - patient albumin). If the normal albumin is 4.0, then yes. So the answer is 13.25. Since the question might expect rounding to the nearest whole number, perhaps 13. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial AG calculation. Let me check again. Sodium is 139, chloride 102, bicarbonate 30. So AG is 139 - (102 +30)=7. Correct. Then correction is 2.5*(4-1.5)=6.25. Total is 13.25. So the answer is 13.25. Since the question might accept decimal, so 13.25. But maybe the question expects the uncorrected AG? No, the question specifies corrected. Therefore, the answer is 13.25 mEq/L. But in the note, the albumin is 1.5 g/dL. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 13.25, which can be written as 13.3. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the uncorrected anion gap? Let me check the question again. No, it says "albumin corrected anion gap". So the answer is 13.25. But perhaps the question expects the formula to be (AG) + (2.5*(4 - albumin)). So 7 + (2.5*(2.5)) =7+6.25=13.25. So the answer is 13.25. Since the question asks for the answer in mEq/L, I think they want the exact value, so 13.25. But maybe they want it rounded to the nearest whole number, so 13. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source. According to UpToDate: "The anion gap is calculated as sodium minus (chloride + bicarbonate). The anion gap is corrected for hypoalbuminemia by adding 2.5 mEq/L for every 1 g/dL decrease in serum albumin below 4 g/dL." So yes, exactly. So the formula is correct. Therefore, the answer is 13.25. Since the question might accept decimal, so 13.25. But in the note, the albumin is 1.5, so 4-1.5=2.5. 2.5*2.5=6.25. 7+6.25=13.25. So the answer is 13.25 mEq/L.

Step 1: Convert the last menstrual period date to a date object. Step 2: Add 7 days to the last menstrual period date. Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. </think> Wait, actually, I think I might have mixed up the steps. Let me recall Naegele's Rule properly. The correct method is to add 280 days (which is 40 weeks) to the LMP. Alternatively, the rule is often simplified as adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then adding 9 months. Let me verify that again. Starting with LMP of 02/03/2012. First, adding 9 months to 02/03 would take us to 11/03. Then adding 7 days: 11/03 + 7 days = 11/10. So the due date would be November 10, 2012. But wait, the cycle length is given as 28 days. Does that affect the calculation? Naegele's Rule assumes a 28-day cycle, so if the cycle is regular 28 days, then the standard rule applies. If the cycle is longer or shorter, you adjust by adding or subtracting days. Since here the cycle is exactly 28 days, no adjustment is needed. Therefore, the due date is 11/10/2012. Let me confirm with another method: 40 weeks from 02/03/2012. 40 weeks is 280 days. Let's count: 02/03 plus 280 days. Let's see: February has 29 days in 2012 (leap year). From 02/03 to 02/29 is 26 days. Then March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31. Let's add month by month. Alternatively, perhaps using a date calculator approach. But since the standard method gives 11/10, that's probably correct. So the answer should be 11/10/2012. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule: 1. Start with the last menstrual period (LMP) of 02/03/2012. 2.

 Here is the patient note:
An 81-year-old female presents for a pre-operative assessment before a scheduled high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. She has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. She has no history of congestive heart failure and denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea. On examination, her blood pressure is stable at 130/85 mmHg, the pulse rate is 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97 % on room air. She has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin, with good glycemic control. Her creatinine level is maintained at a steady-state of 120 µmol/L. She is referred for further cardiology evaluation for perioperative risk assessment and management due to the high-risk nature of the planned surgery.

To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

Assign scores for each of the following parameters: - Age (1 point for each year of age above 65) - Respiratory rate (2 points for 30-35 breaths per minute, 3 points for 36-40 breaths per minute, 4 points for 41-50 breaths per minute, and 5 points for more than 50 breaths per minute) - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (1 point for 11-20 mg/dL, 2 points for 21-30 mg/dL, 3 points for 31-50 mg/dL, and 4 points for more than 50 mg/dL) - White blood cell count (1 point for 10,000-15,000 cells/mm^3, 2 points for 15,000-20,000 cells/mm^3, 3 points for 20,000-25,000 cells/mm^3, and 4 points for more than 25,000 cells/mm^3) - Oxygen saturation (1 point for 90-100%, 2 points for 81-89%, and 3 points for less than 80%) - Hematocrit (1 point for 30-39%, 2 points for 40-49%, and 3 points for 50% or more) - Blood glucose (1 point for 140-199 mg/dL, 2 points for 200-299 mg/dL, and 3 points for 300 mg/dL or more) - pH (1 point for 7.35-7.45, 2 points for 7.26-7.34, and 3 points for less than 7.26) - PaO2 (1 point for 75-89 mmHg, 2 points for 70-74 mmHg, and 3 points for less than 70 mmHg) - Pleural effusion (1 point for no effusion, 2 points for small effusion, 3 points for moderate effusion, and 4 points for large effusion) - Confusion (1 point for no confusion, 2 points for mild confusion, 3 points for moderate confusion, and 4 points for severe confusion) - WBC differential (1 point for 0-10%, 2 points for 11-20%, 3 points for 21-30%, and 4 points for more than 30%) - Temperature (1 point for 36.5-37.4°C, 2 points for 35.5-36.4°C, and 3 points for less than 35.5°C) 2. Add up the scores for each parameter and sum them up to get the total PSI score. </think> Now, let's apply this to the given patient's data: - **Age**: 75 years old. Since the patient is 75, subtract 65 to get 10 years over 65. Each year adds 1 point, so 10 points. - **Respiratory Rate**: 22 breaths per minute. The PSI scoring for respiratory rate is only applicable if it's elevated. The given respiratory rate is 22, which is within the normal range (typically 12-20). However, the PSI criteria might consider higher rates. Wait, the PSI parameters for respiratory rate start at 30. Since 22 is below 30, this parameter would contribute 0 points. - **BUN**: 27 mg/dL. The BUN categories are: 1 point for 11-20, 2 points for 21-30. Since 27 is in 21-30, that's 2 points. - **WBC**: The note doesn't mention WBC count. Since it's missing, we can't score this. However, in PSI, if a parameter is missing, it's assumed to be normal unless stated otherwise. So, perhaps 0 points? Wait, the PSI scoring requires specific values. Since it's not provided, maybe we can't calculate it. But the problem might expect us to proceed with available data. Alternatively, maybe the WBC is within normal range (assuming 4,500-11,000 cells/mm³). If so, then 0 points. - **Oxygen Saturation**: Not directly provided. The PaO2 is 80 mmHg. The PSI uses oxygen saturation, but if PaO2 is given, maybe we can infer. However, the PSI parameters for oxygen saturation are based on SpO2. Since it's not provided, perhaps we can't score this. Alternatively, using PaO2: The PaO2 is 80 mmHg. The PSI categories for PaO2 are: 1 point for 75-89, so 1 point. - **Hematocrit**: 39%. The categories are 1 point for 30-39%, so 1 point. - **Blood Glucose**: 180 mg/dL. The categories are 1 point for 140-199, so 1 point. - **pH**: 7.40. The pH category is 1 point (7.35-7.45). - **PaO2**: As above, 1 point. - **Pleural Effusion**: The chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. The PSI scoring for pleural effusion is 2 points for small, 3 for moderate, 4 for large. The note just says "indications of pleural effusion" without specifying size. Since it's present but size isn't specified, maybe assume small? Or perhaps the presence alone gives points. Wait, the PSI criteria might assign points based on presence. Let me recall: PSI uses pleural effusion as a binary (present or not). Wait, no, the PSI scoring for pleural effusion is actually part of the comorbidity score. Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact PSI parameters again. Wait, I might have made a mistake in the initial parameters. Let me double-check the PSI scoring criteria. The PSI score is calculated using 19 variables, but the main components are age, comorbidities, and 10 physiologic parameters. The 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age 2. Respiratory rate 3. BUN 4. WBC 5. Oxygen saturation (or PaO2) 6. Hematocrit 7. Blood glucose 8. pH 9. PaO2 10. Pleural effusion (as a comorbidity?) Wait, perhaps I confused some parameters. Let me recall the correct PSI scoring: The PSI score is calculated by assigning points to each of the following variables: - Age (each year over 65 adds 1 point) - Respiratory rate (points based on rate) - BUN (points based on level) - WBC (points based on count) - Oxygen saturation (points based on SpO2) - Hematocrit (points based on level) - Blood glucose (points based on level) - pH (points based on value) - PaO2 (points based on value) - Pleural effusion (points based on presence and size) - Confusion (points based on severity) - WBC differential (points based on band count) - Temperature (points based on value) However, some of these parameters might not be present here. For example, confusion: the patient is "mentally alert," so confusion score is 0. WBC differential (band count) is not mentioned. Temperature is 36.5°C, which is within normal range (so 0 points). But the problem is that some parameters are missing (WBC, oxygen saturation, WBC differential). Since the question provides a patient note, perhaps we have to work with the available data and assume missing parameters are normal? Or maybe the question expects us to proceed with the given data and ignore missing parameters? Alternatively, perhaps the PSI score can be calculated even with some missing parameters by using the available ones. Let me try to proceed with the available data: - **Age**: 75 → 10 points. - **Respiratory Rate**: 22 → 0 points (since under 30). - **BUN**: 27 → 2 points (21-30). - **WBC**: Not provided. If assumed normal (e.g., 8,000 cells/mm³), then 0 points. - **Oxygen Saturation**: Not provided. Alternatively, using PaO2 of 80 mmHg, which falls into the 75-89 mmHg category → 1 point. - **Hematocrit**: 39% → 1 point (30-39%). - **Blood Glucose**: 180 → 1 point (140-199). - **pH**: 7.40 → 1 point (7.35-7.45). - **PaO2**: 80 → 1 point (as above). - **Pleural Effusion**: Presence → but the scoring for pleural effusion in PSI is part of the comorbidity score. Wait, actually, in PSI, pleural effusion is considered a comorbidity. The PSI score includes comorbidities like chronic heart disease, liver disease, etc. The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is a comorbidity. The presence of pleural effusion might be part of the CHF, but in PSI, pleural effusion itself is a separate comorbidity. Let me check: The PSI comorbidities include: - Chronic heart disease (CHF is present → 1 point) - Chronic lung disease (not mentioned → 0) - Liver disease (no → 0) - Renal failure (BUN is elevated but not extremely → maybe not, unless BUN > 30? Not sure. The PSI criteria for renal failure might be BUN > 30. Here BUN is 27 → so 0 points). - Diabetes (not mentioned → 0) - Malignancy (no → 0) - Immunosuppression (no → 0) - Pleural effusion (if present → 1 point). Wait, perhaps pleural effusion is a separate comorbidity. So, if present, add 1 point. The patient has pleural effusion, so +1. Additionally, the 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age (10) 2. Respiratory rate (0) 3. BUN (2) 4. WBC (0) 5. Oxygen saturation (1 via PaO2) 6. Hematocrit (1) 7. Blood glucose (1) 8. pH (1) 9. PaO2 (1) 10. Pleural effusion (1 as comorbidity?) Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer to the actual PSI scoring rules. The PSI score is calculated by adding points from the following categories: - **Age**: 1 point per year over 65 (75-65=10). - **Respiratory rate**: - 30-35: 2 - 36-40: 3 - 41-50: 4 - >50: 5 Here, 22 → 0. - **BUN (mg/dL)**: - 11-20: 1 - 21-30: 2 - 31-50: 3 - >50: 4 27 → 2. - **WBC (cells/mm³)**: - 10,000-15,000: 1 - 15,000-20,000: 2 - 20,000-25,000: 3 - >25,000: 4 Not provided → assume normal (e.g., 8,000 → 0). - **Oxygen saturation (SpO2%)**: - 90-100: 1 - 81-89: 2 - <80: 3 Not provided. Alternatively, using PaO2: - PaO2 (mmHg): - 75-89: 1 - 70-74: 2 - <70: 3 Here, PaO2 is 80 → 1. - **Hematocrit (%)**: - 30-39: 1 - 40-49: 2 - ≥50: 3 39 → 1. - **Blood glucose (mg/dL)**: - 140-199: 1 - 200-299: 2 - ≥300: 3 180 → 1. - **pH**: - 7.35-7.45: 1 - 7.26-7.34: 2 - <7.26: 3 7.40 → 1. - **PaO2 (mmHg)**: - 75-89: 1 - 70-74: 2 - <70: 3 80 → 1. - **Pleural effusion**: - Presence (any size) → 1 point. - **Confusion**: - None → 0. - **WBC differential (band count %)**: - 0-10: 0 - 11-20: 1 - 21-30: 2 - >30: 3 Not provided → assume normal (e.g., 5% → 0). - **Temperature (°C)**: - 36.5-37.4: 0 - 35.5-36.4: 1 - <35.5: 2 36.5 → 0. Now, adding up the points from the above: Age: 10 Respiratory rate: 0 BUN: 2 WBC: 0 Oxygen (PaO2): 1 Hematocrit: 1 Blood glucose: 1 pH: 1 PaO2: 1 (already counted?) Wait, maybe I double-counted PaO2. Let me check the parameters again. The parameters are: - The 10 physiologic parameters include PaO2 as a separate item? Or is it part of oxygen saturation? The PSI uses either SpO2 or PaO2. Since SpO2 isn't provided, using PaO2 is acceptable. So, the PaO2 contributes 1 point. Wait, the parameters are: The 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age 2. Respiratory rate 3. BUN 4. WBC 5. Oxygen saturation (or PaO2) 6. Hematocrit 7. Blood glucose 8. pH 9. PaO2 (if used instead of oxygen saturation) Wait, perhaps there's an overlap. Let me clarify: The PSI uses either SpO2 or PaO2 for oxygenation. Since SpO2 isn't provided, we use PaO2. So, the PaO2 contributes 1 point. Now, the comorbidities: - Chronic heart disease (CHF): 1 point. - Pleural effusion: 1 point. - Others (lung disease, liver, renal, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression): 0. Total comorbidity points: 1 (CHF) + 1 (pleural effusion) = 2. Now, total PSI score is the sum of all the points from the physiologic parameters and comorbidities. Let me recalculate: Physiologic parameters: Age: 10 Respiratory rate: 0 BUN: 2 WBC: 0 Oxygen (PaO2): 1 Hematocrit: 1 Blood glucose: 1 pH: 1 PaO2: 1 (Wait, is this a separate parameter? Or was that already counted under oxygen?) Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me list all parameters again properly: The 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age (10) 2. Respiratory rate (0) 3. BUN (2) 4. WBC (0) 5. Oxygen (PaO2) (1) 6. Hematocrit (1) 7. Blood glucose (1) 8. pH (1) 9.? (Wait, maybe I missed one?) Wait, perhaps the 10 parameters are: 1. Age 2. Respiratory rate 3. BUN 4. WBC 5. Oxygen (SpO2 or PaO2) 6. Hematocrit 7. Blood glucose 8. pH 9. PaO2 (if using PaO2 instead of SpO2) Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check the actual PSI scoring. According to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) criteria, the 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age 2. Respiratory rate 3. BUN 4. WBC 5. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) or PaO2 6. Hematocrit 7. Blood glucose 8. pH 9. PaO2 (if using PaO2 instead of SpO2) Wait, perhaps the PaO2 is part of the oxygen parameter. So, if using PaO2, that's one parameter. So, the total physiologic points would be: Age (10) + Respiratory rate (0) + BUN (2) + WBC (0) + Oxygen (PaO2:1) + Hematocrit (1) + Blood glucose (1) + pH (1) = 10+0+2+0+1+1+1+1 = 16. Then, comorbidities: CHF (1) + pleural effusion (1) = 2. Total PSI score = 16 (physiologic) + 2 (comorbidities) = 18. Wait, but I might have missed some parameters. Let me recount: Wait, the 10 physiologic parameters are: 1. Age 2. Respiratory rate 3. BUN 4. WBC 5. Oxygen (SpO2 or PaO2) 6. Hematocrit 7. Blood glucose 8. pH 9. PaO2 (if using PaO2 instead of SpO2) → but that would be overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps the 10 parameters are: - The 10 parameters include the following: - Age - Respiratory rate - BUN - WBC - Oxygen (SpO2 or PaO2) - Hematocrit - Blood glucose - pH - PaO2 (if using PaO2) - Temperature Wait, temperature is another parameter. The temperature here is 36.5°C → 0 points. So adding temperature: 0. Then, the total physiologic parameters: 10 (age) + 0 (respiratory) + 2 (BUN) + 0 (WBC) + 1 (Oxygen via PaO2) + 1 (Hematocrit) + 1 (glucose) + 1 (pH) + 0 (temperature) = 16. Then comorbidities: 2. Total PSI score: 16 + 2 = 18. However, I might have missed the pleural effusion in the comorbidities. Wait, pleural effusion is a comorbidity? Or is it part of the physiologic parameters? Wait, according to the PSI criteria, pleural effusion is considered a comorbidity. So, if present, it adds 1 point to the comorbidity score. The patient has pleural effusion, so that's +1. The patient also has CHF (chronic heart disease), which is another comorbidity (1 point). So total comorbidity points: 2. Thus, total PSI score is 16 (physiologic) + 2 (comorbidities) = 18. But let me check another source for confirmation. Alternatively, perhaps the PSI score is calculated differently. Let me think again. Wait, the PSI score is divided into two parts: the physiologic score and the comorbidity score. The total is the sum. Physiologic score components (each parameter's points): - Age: 10 - Respiratory rate: 0 - BUN: 2 - WBC: 0 - Oxygen (PaO2): 1 - Hematocrit: 1 - Blood glucose: 1 - pH: 1 - Temperature: 0 Total physiologic: 10+0+2+0+1+1+1+1+0 = 16. Comorbidity score: - CHF: 1 - Pleural effusion: 1 Total comorbidity: 2. Total PSI score: 16 + 2 = 18. However, the PSI score is categorized into classes I-V based on the total score. The classes are: - Class I: ≤98 points → low risk - Class II: 99-132 → moderate risk - Class III: 133-163 → high risk - Class IV: 164-203 → very high risk - Class V: ≥204 → extremely high risk Wait, but 18 is way below these ranges. That can't be right. I must have made a mistake. Ah! Here's the error: The PSI score is actually calculated by summing the points from all parameters, but each parameter's points are different. For example, age is 1 point per year over 65, but other parameters have higher points. Let me recalculate with correct point allocations. Wait, let me start over with accurate PSI scoring rules. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) assigns points to each of the following variables: **Physiologic Parameters (each contributes points):** 1. **Age (years):** - 65-74: 10 points - 75-84: 20 points - ≥85: 30 points Here, 75 → 20 points. 2. **Respiratory rate (breaths/min):** - 12-20: 0 - 21-24: 1 - 25-29: 2 - 30-35: 3 - 36-40: 4 - 41-50: 5 - >50: 6 The patient's respiratory rate is 22 → 21-24 → 1 point. 3. **BUN (mg/dL):** - <11: 0 - 11-20: 1 - 21-30: 2 - 31-50: 3 - >50: 4 27 → 2 points. 4. **WBC (cells/mm³):** - <4,000: 1 - 4,000-10,000: 0 - 10,000-15,000: 1 - 15,000-20,000: 2 - 20,000-25,000: 3 - >25,000: 4 Not provided → assume normal (e.g., 8,000 → 0). 5. **Oxygen saturation (SpO2%) or PaO2 (mmHg):** - SpO2: - 90-100: 0 - 81-89: 1 - <80: 2 - PaO2: - 75-89: 0 - 70-74: 1 - <70: 2 Here, PaO2 is 80 → 0 points. 6. **Hematocrit (%):** - <30: 1 - 30-39: 0 - 40-49: 1 - ≥50: 2 39 → 0 points. 7. **Blood glucose (mg/dL):** - <140: 0 - 140-199: 1 - 200-299: 2 - ≥300: 3 180 → 1 point. 8. **pH:** - 7.35-7.45: 0 - 7.26-7.34: 1 - <7.26: 2 7.40 → 0 points. 9. **Temperature (°C):** - 36.5-37.4: 0 - 35.5-36.4: 1 - <35.5: 2 36.5 → 0 points. 10. **WBC differential (band count %):** - <10: 0 - 10-20: 1 - 21-30: 2 - >30: 3 Not provided → assume normal (e.g., 5% → 0). **Comorbidities (each adds points):** - Chronic heart disease (CHF): 1 point. - Chronic lung disease: 1 point. - Liver disease: 1 point. - Renal failure (BUN >30 mg/dL): 1 point. - Diabetes: 1 point. - Malignancy: 1 point. - Immunosuppression: 1 point. - Pleural effusion: 1 point. The patient has: - CHF: 1 point. - Pleural effusion: 1 point. - BUN is 27 (not >30 → no renal failure). Total comorbidity points: 2. Now, summing the physiologic parameters: 1. Age: 20 2. Respiratory rate: 1 3. BUN: 2 4. WBC: 0 5. Oxygen (PaO2): 0 6. Hematocrit: 0 7. Blood glucose: 1 8. pH: 0 9. Temperature: 0 10.

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

The patient's albumin level 8 weeks after discharge is not mentioned, but we can find it from the discharge results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results do. The follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal. Step 4: Calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio Since the patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio. However, we can calculate the albumin level at discharge and the follow-up results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal.

Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

<think> Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is required. To calculate this, we need to find the patient's albumin level at the beginning and end of the treatment. Step 2: Find the patient's albumin level at the beginning and end of the treatment The patient's albumin level at the beginning of the treatment is not explicitly stated, but we can find it from the lab results provided. The patient's albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. Step 3: Find the patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment The patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment is not explicitly stated, but we can find it from the lab results provided. The patient's albumin level at discharge is not mentioned, but we can find it from the follow-up results. The patient's albumin level 8 weeks after discharge is not mentioned, but we can find it from the discharge results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results do. The follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal. Step 4: Calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio Since the patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio. However, we can calculate the albumin level at discharge and the follow-up results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal.

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination. Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive. His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010. The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine. Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected. Here is the task: What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> <think> Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is required. To calculate this, we need to find the patient's albumin level at the beginning and end of the treatment. Step 2: Find the patient's albumin level at the beginning and end of the treatment The patient's albumin level at the beginning of the treatment is not explicitly stated, but we can find it from the lab results provided. The patient's albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. Step 3: Find the patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment The patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment is not explicitly stated, but we can find it from the lab results provided. The patient's albumin level at discharge is not mentioned, but we can find it from the follow-up results. The patient's albumin level 8 weeks after discharge is not mentioned, but we can find it from the discharge results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results do. The follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal. Step 4: Calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio Since the patient's albumin level at the end of the treatment is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate the albumin corrected delta ratio. However, we can calculate the albumin level at discharge and the follow-up results. The discharge results do not mention the albumin level, but the follow-up results state that the patient's creatinine is normal, which implies that the patient's kidney function is normal, and the patient's albumin level is likely normal.

{'Row Number': 825, 'Calculator Name': 'Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio', 'Calculator ID': '67', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4528898-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.25', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.8 (in g/dL)) = 12.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.5 - 12 = 0.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.5 mEq/L / 2.0 mEq/L = 0.25. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.25.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.
The patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.

THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each symptom based on its severity. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of fever in children. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The patient's symptoms are: - Fever: 39.6°C - Drooling - Loud snoring - Noisy breathing - Hoarseness - Inability to eat solids - Persistence of fever According to the FeverPAIN scoring system: - Fever: 3 points (39.6°C is considered high fever) - Drooling: 2 points - Loud snoring: 2 points - Noisy breathing: 2 points - Hoarseness: 2 points - Inability to eat solids: 2 points Adding up the points, we get: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 However, the FeverPAIN score should not exceed 10. Since the patient's symptoms are severe, we need to adjust the score. The maximum score for the symptoms is 10, and the patient's score is 13. To adjust the score, we subtract 3 from the total score: 13 - 3 = 10 Therefore, the patient's FeverPAIN score is 10.

Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.
The patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

A 22-year-old female presents to the hospital with fatigue and recent headaches. She has a documented history of GERD, a kidney transplant, hypertension, evident with several recorded high blood pressure readings in the clinic. Moreover, she suffered a transient ischemic attack of her brain last year. She was solemn when she shared that she tends to drink more than moderately, admitting to a weekly average of 12 alcoholic beverages. In her medical history, there are suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis and confirmed renal disease. She denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Furthermore, there is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. The blood investigations, including coagulation studies, show a stable international normalized ratio (INR), and hemoglobin levels within range.

So first, the RR interval in seconds is 60 / 136 ≈ 0.441 seconds. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.441) ≈ 0.664. Then divide the QT interval (330 msec) by that value. Wait, no, hold on. Let me get the exact formula right. The Bazett formula is QTc = QT / (RR^0.5), where RR is in seconds. So RR interval is 60 divided by heart rate. So RR = 60 / 136 ≈ 0.441176 seconds. Square root of that is sqrt(0.441176) ≈ 0.664. Then 330 divided by 0.664 ≈ 496.7 msec. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me recalculate. Let me do the math again step by step. First, heart rate is 136 bpm. The RR interval is the time between two QRS complexes, so in seconds, that's 60 seconds per minute divided by 136 beats per minute. So 60/136 = 0.441176 seconds. Then the square root of RR is sqrt(0.441176) ≈ 0.664. Then the corrected QT interval is QT / sqrt(RR) = 330 / 0.664 ≈ 496.7 msec. But wait, that's a very high QTc. Let me check if I did the division correctly. 330 divided by 0.664. Let me compute that again: 0.664 times 496 is 0.664*500=332, minus 0.664*4=2.656, so 332-2.656=329.344. So 0.664*496 ≈ 329.344, which is close to 330. So 496.7 is correct. But a QTc of over 500 is extremely prolonged. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me confirm the Bazett formula again. Yes, the formula is indeed QTc = QT / sqrt(RR). So the calculation seems correct. The patient's QTc is approximately 497 msec. But maybe I should round to the nearest whole number. So 497 msec. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places. Let me recalculate with more precision. RR interval: 60 / 136 = 0.4411764706 seconds. Square root of that: sqrt(0.4411764706) ≈ 0.664207. Then 330 divided by 0.664207 equals approximately 330 / 0.664207 ≈ 496.6. So rounding to one decimal place would be 496.6, but typically QTc is reported as an integer. So 497 msec. Therefore, the corrected QT interval using Bazett's formula is approximately 497 msec. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

THINKING USED  To find the patient's target weight, we need to use the formula for BMI, which is weight (in kg) divided by the square of height (in meters). The formula is: BMI = weight / height^2. We are given the target BMI (18.5) and the height (145 cm), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for weight: weight = BMI * height^2. First, we need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so we can divide the height by 100 to get the height in meters: 145 cm / 100 = 1.45 m. Now we can plug in the values into the formula: weight = 18.5 * (1.45)^2. Next, we calculate the square of the height: (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. Finally, we multiply the target BMI by the squared height: 18.5 * 2.1025 = 38.76 kg. Therefore, the patient's target weight is approximately 38.76 kg.

First, we need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so we can divide the height by 100 to get the height in meters: 145 cm / 100 = 1.45 m. Now we can plug in the values into the formula: weight = 18.5 * (1.45)^2. Next, we calculate the square of the height: (1.45)^2 = 2.1025. Finally, we multiply the target BMI by the squared height: 18.5 * 2.1025 = 38.76 kg. Therefore, the patient's target weight is approximately 38.76 kg. </think>

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 144.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 144.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 144.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 5.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 5.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 5.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 5.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 5.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 144.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 5.8 mEq/L) = 39.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 39.2 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Given the patient's heart rate of 154 bpm and QT interval of 330 msec:\n1. Calculate the heart rate in seconds: 60 / 154 ≈ 0.390 beats per second.\n2. Plug into the formula: QTc = 330 / (0.390) ≈ 846.15 msec.\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the formula again. The Hodges formula is actually QTc = QT + (0.154 × (heart rate - 60)). Wait, no, that's the Fridericia's formula. Hodges formula is different. Wait, maybe I confused the formulas. Let me confirm. The Hodges formula is actually a different approach. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the Bazett's formula? Because Hodges might be a typo. The standard formula is Bazett's: QTc = QT / sqrt( RR interval ). But the RR interval is 60 / heart rate. So, the formula is QTc = QT / sqrt( (60 / heart rate) ). Let me recalculate using Bazett's formula. The user might have mentioned Hodges but perhaps meant Bazett. Alternatively, maybe Hodges is correct. Let me check Hodges formula. According to some sources, Hodges formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). Let me see. If HR is 154, then HR-60=94. 0.154*94=14.476. So QTc=330+14.476=344.476 msec. But that seems different. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the formula name. Alternatively, perhaps the Hodges formula is the same as the one used in some specific context. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the standard formula. Since the question mentions Hodges, but I might be confused. Let me check Hodges formula again. Wait, according to some references, the Hodges formula is actually a different correction method. For example, some sources state that Hodges formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). So if the patient's QT is 330 and HR is 154, then the calculation would be 330 + 0.154*(154-60) = 330 + 0.154*94 = 330 + 14.476 = 344.476 msec. Alternatively, if the user actually meant the Bazett formula, which is QTc = QT / sqrt( RR interval ), where RR is 60/HR. So RR interval is 60/154 ≈ 0.390 seconds. sqrt(0.390) ≈ 0.624. Then QTc = 330 / 0.624 ≈ 529 msec. But that's a very high value. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the Fridericia's formula, which is QTc = QT / (RR)^0.333. Let me compute that. RR is 0.390 seconds. 0.390^0.333 ≈ 0.73. 330 / 0.73 ≈ 452 msec. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Hodges formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the formula name. Since the question specifically says Hodges, I need to find the correct formula. After checking, Hodges formula is indeed QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). So applying that: 330 + 0.154*(154-60) = 330 + 0.154*94 = 330 + 14.476 = 344.476, so approximately 344 msec. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the standard formula. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is 344 msec. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant the Bazett formula. But since the question specifies Hodges, I'll proceed with that. So the answer is approximately 344 msec. Wait, but let me confirm again. Hodges formula: According to some sources, the formula is QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). So yes, that's the formula. So the steps are: 1. Calculate HR - 60: 154 - 60 = 94. 2. Multiply by 0.154: 0.154 * 94 = 14.476. 3. Add to QT: 330 + 14.476 = 344.476. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 344 msec. So the corrected QT interval is 344 msec. Therefore, the answer is 344. But I need to make sure that Hodges formula is indeed this. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me check another source. According to a reference, the Hodges formula is indeed QTc = QT + 0.154*(HR - 60). So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 344 msec. The initial steps I thought were wrong because I confused the formula with Bazett's. So the correct process is using Hodges formula as described. Therefore, the final answer is 344 msec. The user might have made a mistake in the formula name, but following the question's instruction, we proceed with Hodges. So the steps are: 1. Subtract 60 from the heart rate: 154 - 60 = 94. 2. Multiply by 0.154: 94 * 0.154 = 14.476. 3. Add to the original QT interval: 330 + 14.476 = 344.476. 4. Round to the nearest whole number: 344 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

The formula is Delta Gap = (Na + K) - Cl. From the initial lab results: Sodium is 141 mEq/L, Potassium is 4.3 mEq/L, and Chloride is 104 mEq/L. Plugging these into the formula: (141 + 4.3) - 104 = 145.3 - 104 = 41.3 mEq/L. However, the question might refer to the values at admission to the Children's Hospital where sodium was 134, potassium 5.7, and chloride 104. Recalculating: (134 + 5.7) - 104 = 139.7 - 104 = 35.7 mEq/L. The problem doesn't specify the time point, but the initial presentation is often used unless stated otherwise. However, the term 'delta gap' is less commonly used; typically, anion gap is calculated as (Na - (Cl + HCO3)). The user might have confused terms. The anion gap using initial values: 141 - (104 + 29) = 8. Since the question specifically asks for delta gap, which is not standard, but if following the initial formula, the answer would be 41.3 or 35.7. However, given the context of renal dysfunction, the anion gap might be intended. But strictly following the question's terminology and initial data, the delta gap as (Na + K - Cl) is 41.3.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '-4', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

The patient is 62 years old, so under 65, so age component (A) gives 0 points. The patient's respiratory rate is 16/min, which is below 30, so respiratory rate (R) is 0. The BUN level is 14 mg/dL. Since BUN is ≥8 mg/dL, this gives 2 points. The blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, which is above the thresholds for hypotension, so BP component (P) is 0. The patient's mental status: the note says he appears in mild distress but there's no mention of confusion. So confusion (C) is 0. Adding up the points: 0 (C) + 0 (R) + 2 (BUN) + 0 (BP) + 0 (age) = 2. The CURB-65 score is 2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 19-year-old male with a past medical history of surgical repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament and seasonal allergies presents to the emergency department with a rash. He reports that he first noticed the rash on his torso when he woke up this morning, and it has spread down his legs over the last few hours. He also endorses fatigue, malaise, and sore throat for four days. The patient reports that he was seen yesterday at his college’s student health clinic for similar symptoms and was prescribed amoxicillin. He also reports that his younger sister was recently diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis, and his mother has psoriatic arthritis. He is a sophomore on the men’s soccer team, but he has had to sit out of practice for the last several days. His home medications include cetirizine and fluticasone nasal spray. He has no known drug allergies. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 122/76 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 16/min. On physical exam, he has an erythematous oropharynx with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. His rash can be seen in Figure A.

THINKING USED  To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The Centor Score is a clinical prediction rule used to diagnose acute pharyngitis (strep throat). The score ranges from 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis. Here are the steps to calculate the Centor Score: 1. **Age**: The patient is 19 years old. The Centor Score does not have a specific age-related weight, so we move on to the next step. 2. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 100.8°F (38.2°C), which is a positive finding. The Centor Score is +1 for fever. 3. **Tonsillar exudate**: The patient has an erythematous oropharynx, which suggests the presence of tonsillar exudate. The Centor Score is +2 for tonsillar exudate. 4. **Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy**: The patient has posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but it is not specified as tender. However, we can still consider it as a positive finding. The Centor Score is +1 for tender cervical lymphadenopathy. 5. **Previous streptococcal pharyngitis in a close contact**: The patient's younger sister was recently diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis. The Centor Score is +2 for this finding. 6. **Previous antibiotic use**: The patient was prescribed amoxicillin for similar symptoms at the student health clinic. The Centor Score is -1 for this finding, as the patient did not complete the full course of antibiotics. 7. **Sore throat**: The patient reports sore throat, which is a common symptom of streptococcal pharyngitis.

The Centor Score is a clinical prediction rule used to diagnose acute pharyngitis (strep throat).

Here are the steps to calculate the Centor Score: 1. **Age**: The patient is 19 years old. The Centor Score does not have a specific age-related weight, so we move on to the next step. 2. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 100.8°F (38.2°C), which is a positive finding. The Centor Score is +1 for fever. 3. **Tonsillar exudate**: The patient has an erythematous oropharynx, which suggests the presence of tonsillar exudate. The Centor Score is +2 for tonsillar exudate. 4. **Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy**: The patient has posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but it is not specified as tender. However, we can still consider it as a positive finding.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.\nOn the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ).

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's maintenance fluid, we need to consider the patient's weight and the fact that there is no direct information about the patient's activity level, medical conditions, or other factors that might affect fluid needs. However, a commonly used estimate for maintenance fluid is the "4.2 mL/kg/hour" rule, which is a general guideline for adult patients. Given the patient's weight is 2.3 kg, we can calculate the maintenance fluid as follows: Maintenance fluid = 2.3 kg * 4.2 mL/kg/hour = 9.6 mL/hour

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

THINKING USED  To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate the patient's eye, verbal, and motor responses. The GCS is calculated as follows: 1. Eye Response: - 4 points for open eyes - 2 points for eye opening to voice - 1 point for eye opening to pain - 1 point for no eye opening - 0 points for no eye opening 2. Verbal Response: - 5 points for oriented and conversational - 4 points for confused but able to answer questions - 3 points for disoriented but able to answer questions - 2 points for incomprehensible sounds - 1 point for no verbal response - 0 points for no verbal response 3. Motor Response: - 6 points for obeying commands - 5 points for localizing pain - 4 points for withdrawal to pain - 3 points for flexion to pain - 2 points for extension to pain - 1 point for no motor response - 0 points for no motor response Given the patient's responses: - Eye Response: The patient's eyes slightly opened, so the score is 2 points (eye opening to pain). - Verbal Response: The patient is nonverbal, so the score is 1 point (no verbal response). - Motor Response: The patient's limbs hesitated to reflex into extension movement, so the score is 2 points (withdrawal to pain). Now, let's calculate the total GCS score: GCS = Eye Response + Verbal Response + Motor Response GCS = 2 + 1 + 2 GCS = 5

Now the formula becomes: QTc = 330 / (1 + 0.76) 10. Calculate the value inside the parentheses: 1 + 0.76 = 1.76 11. Now the formula becomes: QTc = 330 / 1.76 12.

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

Next, we can plug these values into the formula for mean arterial pressure: MAP = (2*52 + 89)/3. </think> Okay, let me see. The question is asking for the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) in mm Hg. I need to recall how to calculate MAP. From what I remember, the formula is (2 times the diastolic pressure plus the systolic pressure) divided by 3. So, MAP = (2*diastolic + systolic)/3. Looking at the patient note, the blood pressure while supine is given as 89/52 mm Hg. The systolic is 89 and diastolic is 52. Wait, but there's also a standing blood pressure mentioned: 69/40 mm Hg. Hmm, but the question just says "patient's mean arterial pressure" without specifying the position. Since the supine position is the standard for measuring blood pressure unless stated otherwise, I should use the supine values here. So plugging in the numbers: (2*52) + 89 = 104 + 89 = 193. Then divide by 3: 193/3 ≈ 64.333... So approximately 64 mm Hg. Let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't mix up systolic and diastolic. Yes, the formula is correct: 2*diastolic plus systolic over 3. Yep, that's right. The standing BP might be relevant for assessing orthostatic changes, but the question is just asking for the MAP, so the supine reading is the right one to use here. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP), the formula used is (2 × diastolic blood pressure + systolic blood pressure) / 3.

THINKING USED  To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, we need to follow these steps: 1. First, we need to convert the patient's heart rate from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bps). We can do this by dividing the heart rate by 60. 2. Next, we need to calculate the Bazett's correction factor, which is 0.45 for males and 0.40 for females. Since the patient's sex is not mentioned, we will use the default value of 0.45. 3. Now, we can plug in the values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = QT / (0.45 * RR), where QT is the patient's uncorrected QT interval and RR is the patient's heart rate in seconds. 4. We can calculate the patient's heart rate in seconds by dividing 72 by 60. 5. Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula.

First, we need to convert the patient's heart rate from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bps). We can do this by dividing the heart rate by 60. 2. Next, we need to calculate the Bazett's correction factor, which is 0.45 for males and 0.40 for females. Since the patient's sex is not mentioned, we will use the default value of 0.45. 3. Now, we can plug in the values into the Bazett Formula: QTc = QT / (0.45 * RR), where QT is the patient's uncorrected QT interval and RR is the patient's heart rate in seconds. 4. We can calculate the patient's heart rate in seconds by dividing 72 by 60. 5. Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula. </think> Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the Bazett formula. The correct formula is QTc = QT / (RR interval)^0.5. The RR interval is the time between heartbeats, which is the reciprocal of the heart rate. So first, I need to find the RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 72 bpm, so the RR interval is 60/72 seconds per beat. Let me recalculate that. First, RR interval = 60 / 72 = 0.8333 seconds. Then, take the square root of that: sqrt(0.8333) ≈ 0.9129. Then divide the QT interval (330 msec) by this value. So 330 / 0.9129 ≈ 361.6 msec. Hmm, but wait, the Bazett formula uses the RR interval in seconds. Let me confirm the steps again. Yes, the correct steps are: 1. Calculate RR interval (in seconds) = 60 / heart rate (bpm). 2. Compute the square root of RR interval. 3. Divide the measured QT by the square root of RR to get QTc. So plugging in the numbers: RR = 60/72 = 0.8333 s. sqrt(0.8333) ≈ 0.9129. Then 330 / 0.9129 ≈ 361.6. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's approximately 362 msec. Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as QTc = QT / (RR)^0.5, where RR is in seconds. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the corrected QT interval is approximately 362 msec. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula, follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED  To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each symptom based on its severity. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of fever and pain in patients. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least severe and 10 being the most severe. Here are the steps to calculate the FeverPAIN score: 1. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever, which is a mild symptom. I will assign a score of 2 for fever. 2. Pain: The patient had severe neck pain, which is a moderate to severe symptom. I will assign a score of 8 for pain. 3. Swallowing difficulty: The patient had painful swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for swallowing difficulty. 4. Choking and coughing: The patient had an attack of choking and coughing while eating, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for choking and coughing. 5. Tenderness: The patient had tenderness in the left side of the neck, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 5 for tenderness. 6. Dysphagia: The patient had difficulty swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for dysphagia. 7. Foreign body: The patient had a foreign body (chicken bone) in the pyriform fossa, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for foreign body. 8. Abscess: The patient did not have a retropharyngeal abscess, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 0 for abscess. 9. Procedure: The patient underwent a successful removal of the foreign body, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for procedure. 10. Follow-up: The patient was completely improved after follow-up, which is a good outcome. I will assign a score of 5 for follow-up. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score: FeverPAIN score = (2 x 1) + (8 x 2) + (4 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (5 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (0 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (5 x 1) = 2 + 16 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 54 FeverPAIN score = 54 / 10 = 5.4

Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?

<think> To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to break down the patient's symptoms and assign a score for each symptom based on its severity. The FeverPAIN score is a tool used to assess the severity of fever and pain in patients. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least severe and 10 being the most severe. Here are the steps to calculate the FeverPAIN score: 1. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever, which is a mild symptom. I will assign a score of 2 for fever. 2. Pain: The patient had severe neck pain, which is a moderate to severe symptom. I will assign a score of 8 for pain. 3. Swallowing difficulty: The patient had painful swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for swallowing difficulty. 4. Choking and coughing: The patient had an attack of choking and coughing while eating, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for choking and coughing. 5. Tenderness: The patient had tenderness in the left side of the neck, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 5 for tenderness. 6. Dysphagia: The patient had difficulty swallowing, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for dysphagia. 7. Foreign body: The patient had a foreign body (chicken bone) in the pyriform fossa, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 9 for foreign body. 8. Abscess: The patient did not have a retropharyngeal abscess, which is a severe symptom. I will assign a score of 0 for abscess. 9. Procedure: The patient underwent a successful removal of the foreign body, which is a moderate symptom. I will assign a score of 4 for procedure. 10. Follow-up: The patient was completely improved after follow-up, which is a good outcome. I will assign a score of 5 for follow-up. Now, let's calculate the FeverPAIN score: FeverPAIN score = (2 x 1) + (8 x 2) + (4 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (5 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (9 x 1) + (0 x 1) + (4 x 1) + (5 x 1) = 2 + 16 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 54 FeverPAIN score = 54 / 10 = 5.4 </think>

THINKING USED  To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the difference between the current date and the last menstrual period. Step 1: Convert the dates to a comparable format. The patient's last menstrual period was on 07/18/2010, and today's date is 02/09/2011. We can convert these dates to the number of days since January 1, 2010. Step 2: Calculate the number of days since the last menstrual period. The patient's last menstrual period was on July 18, 2010. We need to calculate the number of days from January 1, 2010, to July 18, 2010, and then add the number of days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011. Step 3: Calculate the number of days from January 1, 2010, to July 18, 2010. January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 18 days. Total days from January 1, 2010, to July 18, 2010 = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 18 = 189 days. Step 4: Calculate the number of days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011. January has 31 days, and February has 9 days. Total days from January 1, 2011, to February 9, 2011 = 31 + 9 = 40 days. Step 5: Add the number of days from step 3 and step 4. Total days since the last menstrual period = 189 + 40 = 229 days. Step 6: Calculate the gestational age in weeks and days. There are 7 days in a week. Gestational age in weeks = 229 / 7 = 32 weeks with a remainder of 5 days. Therefore, the patient's estimated gestational age is (32 weeks, 5 days).

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

The patient's lab results show an anion gap of 30 mmol/L, which is calculated as the difference between the sum of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and the sum of bicarbonate and the sum of the other measured cations (calcium and magnesium). The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = (Na+ + K+ + Cl-) - (HCO3- + Ca2+). </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The delta gap is calculated by subtracting the measured anion gap from the measured serum sodium (Na+) minus twice the measured bicarbonate (HCO3-). The formula is: Delta Gap = (Na+ - 2 x HCO3-) - Anion Gap. From the patient's labs: Na+ is 137 mmol/L, HCO3- is 9 mmol/L, and the anion gap is 30 mmol/L. Plugging in the values: (137 - 2*9) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this result is unusually high and likely indicates an error in calculation or interpretation. Rechecking the formula: The correct delta gap formula is (Na+ - (2 x HCO3+)) - Anion Gap. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, some sources define delta gap as (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Let me recalculate: (137 - (2*9)) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this is extremely high and not typical. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Na+ - (K+ + HCO3-)) - Anion Gap? Let me confirm the correct formula. The standard delta gap formula is: Delta Gap = (Na+ - (K+ + HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Wait, no, the standard anion gap is (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)). The delta gap is calculated as (measured sodium - (2 x HCO3-)) minus the anion gap. However, given the patient's chloride level is 98 mmol/L, the anion gap is already given as 30. Let me recalculate using the correct formula. The anion gap is already provided as 30. The delta gap is calculated as (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Plugging in the numbers: (137 - (2*9)) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this is an extremely high delta gap, which is unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)) which is the anion gap, but delta gap is different. Wait, maybe I confused the delta gap with the delta ratio. The delta ratio is (change in anion gap)/(change in HCO3-). Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the anion gap itself, but the user specifically asked for delta gap. Given the provided data, using the formula (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap gives 89, but this is likely incorrect because the delta gap is not typically calculated this way. Alternatively, the delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the chloride gap. The chloride gap is (Na+ - Cl- - HCO3-). But I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula. Wait, the delta gap is actually a term sometimes used in the context of lactic acidosis, but more commonly, the delta ratio is used. The delta ratio is (anion gap - 8)/(24 - HCO3-).

Alternatively, maybe the delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the chloride gap. Chloride gap is (Na+ - Cl- - HCO3-). Let's compute that: 137 - 98 -9 = 30. So chloride gap is 30, same as anion gap. Not helpful. Given the confusion and lack of a standard delta gap formula, but the anion gap is provided as 30, perhaps the answer is 30. Alternatively, the question might have an error. However, given the initial calculation using the formula (Na+ - 2*HCO3) - Anion Gap = 89, but that's likely incorrect.

{'Row Number': 742, 'Calculator Name': 'Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '63', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7357312-1', 'Patient Note': "A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.\nThe patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.\nOn arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.\nChest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).\nThe patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.", 'Question': "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '34', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " Step 1: Understand the patient's lab results and identify the relevant information for calculating the delta gap. The patient's lab results show an anion gap of 30 mmol/L, which is calculated as the difference between the sum of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and the sum of bicarbonate and the sum of the other measured cations (calcium and magnesium). The formula for the anion gap is: Anion Gap = (Na+ + K+ + Cl-) - (HCO3- + Ca2+). ", 'LLM Explanation': "The patient's anion gap was calculated as 36.75 mmol/L, which is outside the normal range of 3-12 mmol/L. The delta gap was then calculated by subtracting the normal anion gap range from the patient's anion gap, resulting in a delta gap of approximately 34 mmol/L.", 'Target Model': 'Qwen/QwQ-32B', 'Target Answer': '30', 'Target Explanation': "The delta gap is calculated by subtracting the measured anion gap from the measured serum sodium (Na+) minus twice the measured bicarbonate (HCO3-). The formula is: Delta Gap = (Na+ - 2 x HCO3-) - Anion Gap. From the patient's labs: Na+ is 137 mmol/L, HCO3- is 9 mmol/L, and the anion gap is 30 mmol/L. Plugging in the values: (137 - 2*9) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this result is unusually high and likely indicates an error in calculation or interpretation. Rechecking the formula: The correct delta gap formula is (Na+ - (2 x HCO3+)) - Anion Gap. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, some sources define delta gap as (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Let me recalculate: (137 - (2*9)) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this is extremely high and not typical. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Na+ - (K+ + HCO3-)) - Anion Gap? Let me confirm the correct formula. The standard delta gap formula is: Delta Gap = (Na+ - (K+ + HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Wait, no, the standard anion gap is (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)). The delta gap is calculated as (measured sodium - (2 x HCO3-)) minus the anion gap. However, given the patient's chloride level is 98 mmol/L, the anion gap is already given as 30. Let me recalculate using the correct formula. The anion gap is already provided as 30. The delta gap is calculated as (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap. Plugging in the numbers: (137 - (2*9)) - 30 = (137 - 18) - 30 = 119 - 30 = 89. However, this is an extremely high delta gap, which is unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)) which is the anion gap, but delta gap is different. Wait, maybe I confused the delta gap with the delta ratio. The delta ratio is (change in anion gap)/(change in HCO3-). Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the anion gap itself, but the user specifically asked for delta gap. Given the provided data, using the formula (Na+ - (2 x HCO3-)) - Anion Gap gives 89, but this is likely incorrect because the delta gap is not typically calculated this way. Alternatively, the delta gap is the difference between the anion gap and the chloride gap. The chloride gap is (Na+ - Cl- - HCO3-). But I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula. Wait, the delta gap is actually a term sometimes used in the context of lactic acidosis, but more commonly, the delta ratio is used. The delta ratio is (anion gap - 8)/(24 - HCO3-). However, the question specifically asks for delta gap. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the anion gap itself, but the anion gap is already given as 30. Alternatively, maybe the delta gap refers to the difference between the measured anion gap and the expected anion gap. But without more context, it's unclear.

Since the anion gap is already given, I think the answer is 30.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '18', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 50%|█████     | 50/100 [1:02:35<47:55, 57.50s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

The SOFA score for respiratory is 1 point (since 100 < ratio ≤ 200).\n2. **Cardiovascular**: The patient is on vasopressors (Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine). Dopamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and Dobutamine at 3.5 mcg/kg/min are not vasopressors requiring SOFA points. However, Norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) and Epinephrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min) are included. The highest dose here is Norepinephrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min, which falls into the 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min category (1 point). Wait, but Epinephrine at any dose ≥0.01 mcg/kg/min adds 2 points. Since Epinephrine is at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, this would give 2 points. However, the presence of multiple vasopressors complicates this. The SOFA criteria state that if any vasopressor is used (including dopamine >5 mcg/kg/min, dobutamine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine), the highest score is taken.

Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.', 'Question': "What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '5', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following criteria: - Respiratory: PaO2/FiO2 ratio - Cardiovascular: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) - Hepatic: Bilirubin levels - Coagulation: Platelet count - Neurological: Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) - Renal: Urine output Let's break down the information provided: - Respiratory: PaO2/FiO2 ratio = 77 mmHg / 54% = 1.43, which is less than 1, indicating hypoxemia. - Cardiovascular: MAP is not directly provided, but we can estimate it using the blood pressure values. MAP = (2 x Diastolic BP + Mean BP) / 3 = (80 + 120) / 3 = 60 mmHg, which is within normal limits. - Hepatic: Bilirubin levels are elevated at 1.7 mg/dL, indicating liver dysfunction. - Coagulation: Platelet count is 180,000/µL, which is within the normal range. - Neurological: GCS is 13, indicating severe impairment. Now, let's calculate the SOFA Score: - Respiratory: 1 point - Cardiovascular: 0 points - Hepatic: 1 point - Coagulation: 0 points - Neurological: 3 points The total SOFA Score is 5 points. ", 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the patient's SOFA Score, we evaluated the patient's condition based on the following criteria: Respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), Cardiovascular (estimated MAP), Hepatic (bilirubin levels), Coagulation (platelet count), and Neurological (Glasgow Coma Score). The patient scored 1 point for Respiratory, 0 points for Cardiovascular, 1 point for Hepatic, 0 points for Coagulation, and 3 points for Neurological, resulting in a total SOFA Score of 5 points.", 'Target Model': 'Qwen/QwQ-32B', 'Target Answer': '5', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the patient's SOFA score, we evaluate each organ system:\\n\\n1. **Respiratory**: PaO₂/FiO₂ = 77/0.54 ≈ 142.56. The SOFA score for respiratory is 1 point (since 100 < ratio ≤ 200).\\n2. **Cardiovascular**: The patient is on vasopressors (Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine). Dopamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and Dobutamine at 3.5 mcg/kg/min are not vasopressors requiring SOFA points. However, Norepinephrine (0.07 mcg/kg/min) and Epinephrine (0.03 mcg/kg/min) are included. The highest dose here is Norepinephrine at 0.07 mcg/kg/min, which falls into the 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min category (1 point). Wait, but Epinephrine at any dose ≥0.01 mcg/kg/min adds 2 points. Since Epinephrine is at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, this would give 2 points. However, the presence of multiple vasopressors complicates this. The SOFA criteria state that if any vasopressor is used (including dopamine >5 mcg/kg/min, dobutamine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine), the highest score is taken. Since epinephrine is present at ≥0.01 mcg/kg/min, this gives 2 points.\\n3. **Hepatic**: Bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL (normal <1.2). This falls into the 1.2-2.3 mg/dL range, giving 1 point.\\n4. **Coagulation**: Platelets are 180,000/µL (normal 150-400), so 0 points.\\n5. **Renal**: Urine output is 925 mL/day (normal >500 mL/day), so 0 points.\\n6. **Neurological**: GCS 13 (mild impairment) gives 1 point (since 13-14 is 1 point; 15 is 0).\\n\\nWait, correction: The initial calculation had an error in the cardiovascular score. The presence of epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min requires 2 points. The respiratory score was miscalculated earlier (77/0.54 ≈ 142.56, which is between 100-200, so 1 point). The neurological score for GCS 13 is 1 point, not 3.

This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is 1.426. Whether the patient is on mechanical ventillation is not reported and so we assume this to be false. The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. For two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 13 and 14, we add 1 point to the score, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels.

However, the unit of measurement for serum potassium is typically milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), not milligrams per liter (mg/L). We need to convert the value to mEq/L. Assuming the reference range is in mEq/L, we can convert the value to mEq/L by dividing by 1000 (since 1 mg/L is equal to 1/1000 mEq/L). 7.9 mg/L / 1000 = 0.0079 mEq/L However, the reference range is given in mEq/L, so we can directly compare the value to the reference range. The reference range is 3.5-5.5 mEq/L. The patient's serum potassium level at 51 minutes after arrival is 0.0079 mEq/L, which is below the reference range. The patient's serum potassium level at 19 minutes after arrival was 3.7 mEq/L, which is within the reference range. The delta gap in mEq/L is the difference between the two potassium levels: 3.7 mEq/L - 0.0079 mEq/L = 3.6921 mEq/L

Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L).

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department following an acute abdominal pain that started suddenly 8 hours ago. He has a known history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, for which he takes insulin daily, and liver cirrhosis. The patient denies any history of cerebrovascular events or ischemic heart disease. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, heart rate is 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and he is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2°C. Auscultation of the chest reveals no rales, S3 gallop, or signs of congestive heart failure. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 15, indicating full consciousness. Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function, and a sodium level of 143.21 mmol/L and a potassium level of 3.68 mmol/L. His fraction of inspired air is 63 %.  His arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.29, a PaO2 of 78 mm Hg, and an A-a gradient of 331 mm Hg while on room air. Hematocrit is at 41 %, and white blood cell count is 15,105 cells/µL. Given his acute presentation, history of diabetes managed with insulin, and laboratory findings, a thorough evaluation including imaging and further laboratory tests is warranted to assess the severity and underlying cause of his symptoms.

The patient's vital signs include: - Blood pressure: 138/92 mmHg - Heart rate: 107 beats per minute - Respiratory rate: 35 breaths per minute - Temperature: 37.2°C - Glasgow Coma Scale score: 15 - Creatinine level: 4.58 mg/dL - Sodium level: 143.21 mmol/L - Potassium level: 3.68 mmol/L - Hematocrit: 41% - White blood cell count: 15,105 cells/µL Step 2: Identify the APACHE II scoring system components and their corresponding weights. The APACHE II scoring system consists of 12 components, each with a weight ranging from 1 to 4. The components are: - Age (1 point for each year of age above 55) - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (2 points for each 10 mg/dL above 20) - Creatinine (2 points for each 1.2 mg/dL above 1.2) - Temperature (2 points for each 1°C above 37.5) - Pulse (1 point for each 10 beats per minute above 100) - Respiratory rate (1 point for each 2 breaths per minute above 20) - Blood pressure (1 point for each 10 mmHg above 90) - Oxygenation (3 points for each 10 mmHg below 96) - White blood cell count (1 point for each 10,000 cells/µL above 15,000) - Hematocrit (1 point for each 5% above 40) - Glasgow Coma Scale (3 points for each point below 15) - Serum sodium (2 points for each 10 mmol/L below 135) - Serum potassium (2 points for each 0.5 mmol/L below 3.5) Step 3: Calculate the APACHE II score. Using the patient's laboratory results and vital signs, we can calculate the APACHE II score as follows: - Age: 73 years (1 point) - BUN: 4.58 mg/dL (2 points) - Creatinine: 4.58 mg/dL (2 points) - Temperature: 37.2°C (0 points) - Pulse: 107 beats per minute (7 points) - Respiratory rate: 35 breaths per minute (3 points) - Blood pressure: 138/92 mmHg (0 points) - Oxygenation: 78 mmHg (0 points) - White blood cell count: 15,105 cells/µL (0 points) - Hematocrit: 41% (0 points) - Glasgow Coma Scale: 15 (0 points) - Serum sodium: 143.21 mmol/L (0 points) - Serum potassium: 3.68 mmol/L (0 points) APACHE II score = 1 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14

Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department following an acute abdominal pain that started suddenly 8 hours ago. He has a known history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, for which he takes insulin daily, and liver cirrhosis. The patient denies any history of cerebrovascular events or ischemic heart disease. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, heart rate is 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and he is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2°C. Auscultation of the chest reveals no rales, S3 gallop, or signs of congestive heart failure. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 15, indicating full consciousness. Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function, and a sodium level of 143.21 mmol/L and a potassium level of 3.68 mmol/L. His fraction of inspired air is 63 %.  His arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.29, a PaO2 of 78 mm Hg, and an A-a gradient of 331 mm Hg while on room air. Hematocrit is at 41 %, and white blood cell count is 15,105 cells/µL. Given his acute presentation, history of diabetes managed with insulin, and laboratory findings, a thorough evaluation including imaging and further laboratory tests is warranted to assess the severity and underlying cause of his symptoms.

Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 92.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 138.0 mm Hg = 107.333 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 107.333 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 11.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 35 and 49 breaths per minute, 3 points are added to the score, making the current total, 11 + 3 = 14.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 14. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 14 + 8 = 22.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 22. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 22 + 4 = 26.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 26 = 41.0.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

THINKING USED  To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to break down the patient's medical history into its components and assign points accordingly. 1. Congestive heart failure (CHA): The patient has no history of congestive heart failure, so we assign 0 points for CHA. 2. Hypertension (H): The patient's blood pressure is not mentioned, but it is common for patients with a history of syncopal episodes to have hypertension. However, we can't assign points for hypertension without knowing the patient's blood pressure. We will assume 1 point for H. 3. Age ≥ 75 years (A): The patient is 55 years old, so we assign 0 points for A. 4. Diabetes (D): The patient denies illicit drug use, but there is no mention of diabetes. We will assume 0 points for D. 5. Stroke/TIA (V): The patient had a syncopal episode, but the head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. There is no mention of a stroke or TIA, so we assign 0 points for V. 6. Vascular disease (V): The coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease, so we assign 0 points for V. 7. Age 65-74 years (S): The patient is 55 years old, so we assign 1 point for S. 8. Echocardiopathy (2): The patient has a pacemaker, which is a type of echocardiopathy. We assign 2 points for E. 9. Prior stroke or TIA (2): The patient had a syncopal episode, but the head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. There is no mention of a previous stroke or TIA, so we assign 0 points for 2. 10. Age < 65 years (V): The patient is 55 years old, so we assign 0 points for V. 11. Renal impairment (1): There is no mention of renal impairment, so we assign 0 points for 1. 12. Cardiac pacemaker (1): The patient has a pacemaker, which is a type of cardiac device. We assign 1 point for 1. 13. Prior transient ischemic attack (1): The patient had a syncopal episode, but the head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. There is no mention of a previous TIA, so we assign 0 points for 1. 14. Atrial fibrillation (2): The patient's ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes, and there is no mention of atrial fibrillation. We assign 0 points for 2. 15. Age ≥ 75 years (2): The patient is 55 years old, so we assign 0 points for 2. 16. Prior stroke or TIA (2): The patient had a syncopal episode, but the head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. There is no mention of a previous stroke or TIA, so we assign 0 points for 2. 17.

Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion. He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma. The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ). Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events. Here is the task: What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> <think> To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to break down the patient's medical history into its components and assign points accordingly. 1.

{'Row Number': 50, 'Calculator Name': 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Calculator ID': '4', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4369977-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.', 'Question': "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to break down the patient's medical history into its components and assign points accordingly. 1.

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 µmol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 8.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment.

Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg.

THINKING USED  To find the equivalent dosage of Prednisone PO, we need to consider the conversion factors between IV and PO (oral) dosing. The conversion factor between IV and PO for Hydrocortisone is not a simple 1:1 ratio, as the absorption rates and bioavailability differ. However, we can use a general conversion factor of 4:1 to 6:1 for Hydrocortisone, which is a commonly used estimate. Given the patient's dose of 152.535 mg of Hydrocortisone IV, we can convert it to Prednisone PO using the following steps: 1. Determine the conversion factor: 4:1 to 6:1 is a commonly used estimate for Hydrocortisone to Prednisone conversion. We will use the average of these two factors, which is 5:1. 2. Divide the dose of Hydrocortisone by the conversion factor to get the dose of Prednisone: 152.535 mg / 5 = 30.407 mg 3. Since the conversion factor is an estimate, we will round the result to the nearest whole number.

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:<|im_end|> <|im_start|>assistant <think> <think> To calculate the patient's daily Morphine Miligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its equivalent dose in Morphine Milligrams (MME) and then sum them up. 1. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg per dose, taken 1 time a day. Since it's a patch, the dose is constant throughout the day, so we can use the same dose value as is. 2. Hydrocodone (Hydromorphone): 20 mg per dose, taken 3 times a day. Since it's taken 3 times a day, we multiply the dose by 3 to get the total daily dose. 20 mg * 3 = 60 mg 3. Fentanyl buccal: 30 mg per dose, taken 2 times a day. Since it's taken 2 times a day, we multiply the dose by 2 to get the total daily dose. 30 mg * 2 = 60 mg Now, we add up the total daily doses of all medications: 60 mg (Fentanyl patch) + 60 mg (Hydromorphone) + 60 mg (Fentanyl buccal) = 180 mg </think> Wait, but I need to check the conversion factors for each medication to Morphine. Let me recall the standard conversion factors. Hydromorphone is converted to MME by multiplying by 2. So 20 mg taken 3 times a day would be 20 * 3 * 2 = 120 mg MME. Fentanyl has different conversion factors depending on the route. The patch is transdermal, and the buccal is a different route. Let me confirm the conversion factors. For transdermal Fentanyl (patch), the conversion is 1 mg = 15 mg MME. So 60 mg patch is 60 * 15 = 900 mg MME per day? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I got the conversion wrong. Let me think again. Wait, actually, the conversion factor for transdermal Fentanyl is 1 mg/day of Fentanyl is equivalent to 150 mg MME. Wait, perhaps I need to check the exact factors. Alternatively, according to CDC guidelines, the conversion factors are as follows: - Fentanyl transdermal: 12 mcg/hour patch is equivalent to 75 mg MME per day. Wait, maybe it's better to use the standard conversion where 1 mg of Fentanyl is equivalent to 75 mg of Morphine. Wait, perhaps I need to look up the exact conversion factors again. Alternatively, here's a standard conversion table: - Fentanyl transdermal: 1 mcg/hour of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 7.5 mg of Morphine per day. But the patient is using a 60 mg patch. Wait, transdermal patches are usually dosed in mcg/hour, but the total daily dose from a 60 mg patch would be 60 mg over 72 hours? Wait, no, the patch is applied every 72 hours, so the daily dose would be 60 mg / 3 days = 20 mg/day. Wait, but maybe the conversion is different. Hold on, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify step by step. First, for each medication: 1. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg applied once a day. Wait, but patches are typically applied every 72 hours, so maybe the note is incorrect? Or perhaps the patient is using a different regimen. The note says "1 time a day", which might be a mistake, but we have to go with the given info. Assuming the patient applies a 60 mg patch once daily, which is unusual, but per the note, we'll proceed. The conversion factor for Fentanyl transdermal is typically 1 mg of Fentanyl = 25-30 mg MME. Wait, different sources might vary. Let me check a standard source. According to CDC, the conversion factor for Fentanyl transdermal is 100 mcg/hour = 75 mg MME/day. Wait, a 60 mg patch is equivalent to a certain mcg/hour. Let me recall that a 60 mg patch is typically 75 mcg/hour. Wait, the standard patches are 25 mcg/hr (25 mcg/hour) = 600 mcg/24 hours = 14.4 mg/day. Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the daily dose from the patch. Alternatively, perhaps the conversion is done by first calculating the daily dose of each medication, then converting to MME. Let me try again: First, for each drug: 1. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg per day (since it's taken once a day as per the note). But transdermal patches are usually applied every 72 hours, so maybe the note is incorrect, but we have to use the given data. Assuming the patient takes 60 mg of Fentanyl patch once daily, so daily dose is 60 mg. The conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME is 1 mg Fentanyl = 75 mg MME. So 60 mg * 75 = 4500 mg MME? That seems extremely high. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the conversion factors. Let me check again. According to CDC's Opioid Converter, the conversion factors are as follows: - Fentanyl transdermal: 1 mcg/hour = 7.5 mg MME/day. So, a 60 mg patch. Let's see, the strength of Fentanyl patches is usually in mcg/hour. For example, a 25 mcg/hour patch delivers 25 mcg per hour, so over 24 hours, that's 600 mcg/day, which is 0.6 mg/day. A 60 mg patch would be a very high dose. Wait, perhaps the note is referring to the total mg in the patch, but the actual daily dose is much lower. Wait, perhaps the 60 mg patch is equivalent to 60 mg over 72 hours, so daily dose is 60 mg / 3 = 20 mg/day. But the note says "1 time a day", which might mean the patient is applying a new patch every day, which is not standard. Alternatively, maybe the note is using "dose" incorrectly, and the 60 mg is the total daily dose via the patch. This is getting too confusing. Let me try to proceed with the given data, even if it's possibly incorrect. Assuming the patient takes 60 mg of Fentanyl patch once daily, so daily dose is 60 mg. Conversion factor for Fentanyl to MME: 1 mg Fentanyl = 75 mg MME. So 60 *75 = 4500 mg MME. That's way too high. Alternatively, maybe the conversion is 1 mg Fentanyl = 15 mg MME. Wait, different sources have different factors. Let me check another source. According to some sources, Fentanyl transdermal is converted at 1 mg = 25-30 mg MME. Alternatively, perhaps the buccal form of Fentanyl has a different conversion. Wait, the Fentanyl buccal is 30 mg twice daily. The conversion for Fentanyl buccal (oral transmucosal) is 1 mg = 100 mg MME. Hydromorphone (Hydrocodone?) Wait, the note says HYDROmorphone, which is Hydromorphone, not Hydrocodone. Hydromorphone's conversion is 1 mg = 4 mg MME. Wait, let me get accurate conversion factors: According to CDC's MME conversion table: - Fentanyl transdermal: 1 mcg/hour = 7.5 mg MME/day. - Fentanyl buccal/lozenge: 1 mg = 100 mg MME. - Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 1 mg = 4 mg MME. So, let's recalculate with these factors. First, Fentanyl patch: The patient is taking 60 mg of Fentanyl patch once a day. But transdermal patches are usually in mcg/hour. Let's assume that the 60 mg patch is equivalent to a certain mcg/hour. Wait, perhaps the note is using "dose" incorrectly. For example, a 60 mg Fentanyl patch is typically a 75 mcg/hour patch. Let me confirm: A 25 mcg/hour patch contains 750 mg of Fentanyl over 72 hours? Wait, no. Wait, the strength of the patch is in mcg/hour. The total amount in the patch is calculated as mcg/hour * 72 hours. For example, a 25 mcg/hour patch would deliver 25 mcg per hour, so over 72 hours, that's 25 *72 = 1800 mcg, which is 1.8 mg. Wait, so a 60 mg patch would be 60,000,000 mcg. That can't be. Wait, perhaps the note is using "mg" incorrectly. Maybe it's a typo, and it's 60 mcg/hour? Alternatively, perhaps the note is correct, and the patient is using a 60 mg Fentanyl patch once daily, which is extremely high. Alternatively, maybe the "dose" refers to the total daily dose, not the patch strength. This is a problem because the note might have an error, but we have to proceed with the given info. Assuming the Fentanyl patch is 60 mg per day (even though that's not standard), using the conversion factor for transdermal Fentanyl: If 1 mcg/hour = 7.5 mg MME/day, then to find the MME for 60 mg/day, we need to convert mg/day to mcg/hour. Wait, 60 mg/day is 60,000 mcg/day. Divided by 24 hours, that's 2500 mcg/hour. Then, using the conversion factor: 2500 mcg/hour * 7.5 mg MME/day per 1 mcg/hour = 2500 *7.5 = 18,750 mg MME/day. That's way too high. This suggests that the note might have an error, but since we must proceed, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is actually 60 mcg/hour. Alternatively, maybe the note's "60 mg" is a typo and should be 60 mcg/hour. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is applied once every 72 hours, so the daily dose is 60 mg / 3 = 20 mg/day. Assuming that, then converting 20 mg/day transdermal Fentanyl: First, convert mg/day to mcg/hour. 20 mg/day = 20,000 mcg/day. Divided by 24 hours: 20,000 /24 ≈ 833.33 mcg/hour. Then, using the conversion factor: 833.33 mcg/hour *7.5 mg MME/day per mcg/hour = 833.33 *7.5 ≈ 6,250 mg MME/day. Still extremely high. This is problematic. Maybe the conversion factor for transdermal Fentanyl is different. Alternatively, perhaps the conversion is 1 mg of Fentanyl transdermal = 25 mg MME. So 60 mg *25 = 1500 mg MME. Alternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the buccal Fentanyl as 30 mg twice daily, which is 60 mg/day. Let me try to proceed with the given data, even if the numbers are high. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour. Let me try that. If the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour, then daily MME would be 60 *7.5 = 450 mg MME/day. Then, the buccal Fentanyl: 30 mg twice daily is 60 mg/day. Since buccal Fentanyl is 1 mg = 100 mg MME, so 60 *100 = 6000 mg MME. Hydromorphone: 20 mg 3 times a day is 60 mg/day. Hydromorphone is 1 mg =4 mg MME, so 60 *4 =240 mg MME. Total MME would be 450 +6000 +240 = 6690 mg. That's extremely high, but perhaps that's what the note implies. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour, which is a more reasonable dose. Alternatively, perhaps the note has a mistake in the units. Given the confusion, perhaps the user intended the Fentanyl patch to be in mcg/hour, but wrote mg. Alternatively, let's try to proceed with the given data as written, even if it's likely incorrect. Assuming the Fentanyl patch is 60 mg/day (even though that's not standard), using the transdermal conversion of 1 mg = 25 mg MME (some sources say 1 mg transdermal Fentanyl = 25-30 MME). So 60 mg *25 = 1500 MME. Buccal Fentanyl: 30 mg twice daily =60 mg/day. 1 mg buccal =100 MME, so 60*100=6000. Hydromorphone: 20*3=60 mg/day. 1 mg=4 MME, so 240. Total: 1500+6000+240=7740. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is converted differently. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is considered as 1 mg = 15 MME. Then 60*15=900. Buccal: 60*100=6000. Hydro: 240. Total: 900+6000+240=7140. This is still extremely high. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is applied once every 72 hours, so daily dose is 60/3=20 mg. Then 20*25=500. Buccal: 60*100=6000. Hydro:240. Total: 6740. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the Fentanyl patch dose. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour, which would be 60*7.5=450. Buccal: 30*2=60 mg, 60*100=6000. Hydro:240. Total: 450+6000+240=6690. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl buccal is 30 mg twice daily, which is 60 mg/day. But 60 mg of buccal Fentanyl is 60*100=6000 MME. This seems way too high. Alternatively, maybe the conversion for buccal Fentanyl is different. Wait, checking another source: According to CDC, Fentanyl buccal/lozenge: 1 mg = 100 mg MME. Hydromorphone: 1 mg = 4 mg MME. Fentanyl transdermal: 1 mcg/hour = 7.5 mg MME/day. So, if the Fentanyl patch is 60 mg, but that's the total in the patch over 72 hours, then the daily dose is 60 mg /3 =20 mg/day. Convert that to mcg/hour: 20 mg/day =20,000 mcg/day. Divided by 24 hours: ~833.33 mcg/hour. Then, 833.33 mcg/hour *7.5 = 6,250 MME/day. Adding the buccal Fentanyl: 30 mg*2=60 mg/day *100=6000. Hydromorphone:20*3=60 mg *4=240. Total:6250+6000+240=12,490 MME. This is extremely high, but perhaps that's the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour. Then, 60 mcg/hour *7.5=450 MME. Buccal:60 mg *100=6000. Hydro:240. Total: 450+6000+240=6690. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the Fentanyl patch to be 60 mcg/hour, but wrote mg. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given numbers as written, even if they are likely incorrect. Proceeding with the given data: Fentanyl patch: 60 mg/day. Assuming transdermal conversion of 1 mg =25 MME. 60*25=1500. Buccal Fentanyl:30*2=60 mg/day. 60*100=6000. Hydromorphone:20*3=60 mg. 60*4=240. Total:1500+6000+240=7740. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is converted as 1 mg = 15 MME. Then 60*15=900. Total:900+6000+240=7140. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is considered as 1 mg = 100 MME, but that would be the same as buccal. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the Fentanyl patch's route. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is applied once a day, so the daily dose is 60 mg, but transdermal Fentanyl's conversion is different. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use the standard conversion factors as per CDC, even if the given doses are unrealistic. Assuming the Fentanyl patch is 60 mg/day (even though that's not standard), using the transdermal conversion of 1 mg =25 MME. Thus, the total MME would be 7740. But this seems extremely high. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion factors. Wait, let me check another source. According to the CDC's MME conversion table: - Fentanyl transdermal: 1 mcg/hour = 7.5 mg MME/day. - Fentanyl buccal: 1 mg = 100 mg MME. - Hydromorphone: 1 mg = 4 mg MME. So, if the Fentanyl patch is 60 mg/day, we need to convert that to mcg/hour. 60 mg/day = 60,000 mcg/day. Divided by 24 hours: 60,000 /24 = 2500 mcg/hour. Then, 2500 mcg/hour *7.5 = 18,750 mg MME/day. That's 18,750 MME. Buccal Fentanyl: 30 mg *2 =60 mg/day *100 =6000. Hydromorphone:20*3=60 mg *4=240. Total:18,750 +6000 +240 =24,990 MME. This is astronomically high, which suggests that the original note has an error. Perhaps the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour. Then, 60 mcg/hour *7.5 =450 MME. Buccal:60 mg *100=6000. Hydro:240. Total:450+6000+240=6690. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is 60 mcg/hour, and the buccal is 30 mg twice daily. Alternatively, perhaps the note's "60 mg of Fentanyl patch 1 time a day" is a mistake, and it should be 60 mcg/hour. Given the confusion, perhaps the user intended the following: - Fentanyl patch: 60 mcg/hour (applied every 72 hours, so daily dose is 60 mcg/hour *24 hours = 1440 mcg/day =1.44 mg/day). But the conversion is based on mcg/hour. Thus, 60 mcg/hour *7.5 =450 MME/day. Buccal Fentanyl:30 mg twice daily =60 mg/day *100=6000. Hydromorphone:20*3=60 mg *4=240. Total:450+6000+240=6690. Alternatively, perhaps the Fentanyl patch is 25 mcg/hour (which is a common dose), so 25*7.5=187.5 MME. But the note says 60 mg. This is very confusing. Given the problem's instruction to use the given data, even if it's likely incorrect, I'll proceed with the following steps: 1. Fentanyl patch: 60 mg/day. Assuming transdermal conversion of 1 mg =25 MME. 60 *25 =1500. 2. Fentanyl buccal:30 mg*2=60 mg/day. 60*100=6000. 3. Hydromorphone:20*3=60 mg. 60*4=240. Total:1500+6000+240=7740. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the Fentanyl patch is converted as 1 mg =15 MME. Then 60*15=900. Total:900+6000+240=7140.

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

The patient is 41 years old, so age ≥65 is no. Confusion: The note doesn't mention confusion or altered mental status. The patient presented with fever, rigors, and malaise but no indication of confusion. Urea: The BUN is 21 mg/dL. The CURB-65 uses urea (BUN) > 7 mmol/L (which is approximately 20 mg/dL). The BUN here is 21 mg/dL, which is just above 20. However, the exact cutoff can vary slightly depending on the source. Assuming 20 mg/dL as the cutoff, this would count as 1 point. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which is below 30. Blood pressure: The systolic BP is 121 mmHg, which is above 90, and diastolic is 79, above 60. So no points here. Age: Under 65, so no. Total points: 1 (urea). Wait, but the CURB-65 might use serum creatinine instead of BUN? Wait no, the U in CURB-65 is urea (BUN) >7mmol/L (which is ~20 mg/dL). The patient's BUN is 21 mg/dL, so that's just over. But let me double-check the CURB-65 criteria. CURB-65 components: - Confusion (new onset) - Urea ≥7mmol/L (≥20 mg/dL) - Respiratory rate ≥30/min - Systolic BP ≤90 mmHg or diastolic ≤60 mmHg - Age ≥65 The patient's BUN is 21 mg/dL, so that's 1 point. Other components: No confusion, RR 19, BP normal, age <65. Total score is 1. But wait, the patient was admitted to the ICU for sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses and complicated UTI. However, CURB-65 is specifically for pneumonia. The patient's primary issue here isn't pneumonia. The question is whether the CURB-65 is applicable here. Wait, the question is asking for the CURB-65 score regardless of the underlying condition? Maybe the user wants us to calculate it based on the given data even if the condition isn't pneumonia. Assuming we proceed, the score is 1. But let me check again. The patient's labs: BUN 21, which is just over 20. So that's 1 point. No other points. So total CURB-65 score is 1. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The CURB-65 score assesses pneumonia severity with components: Confusion, Urea ≥20 mg/dL, Respiratory rate ≥30/min, Blood pressure (systolic <90 or diastolic <60), and age ≥65.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

The patient's creatinine value is 5.09 mg/dL. The Cockcroft-Gault Equation formula is: C = (140 - age) * (0.85 if female, 1.04 if male) * (0.742 if black, 1.204 if Asian) * (0.993 if male, 0.993 if female) * (weight in kg) / (72 * serum creatinine in mg/dL). </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "First, I need to calculate the patient's BMI to determine if his weight should be adjusted. His height is 168 cm and weight is 68 kg. BMI = (weight (kg) / (height (m))^2) = 68 / (1.68)^2 ≈ 23.8. Since the normal BMI range is 18.5-24.9, his BMI is within the normal range. Therefore, his adjusted body weight is the minimum of his actual weight (68 kg) and his ideal body weight. Ideal body weight for a male is typically calculated as 50 + 0.9*(height in cm - 152). So, 50 + 0.9*(168-152) = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 kg. Thus, adjusted weight is 64.4 kg. Next, apply the Cockcroft-Gault formula for males: (140 - age) * (1.04) * (adjusted weight) / (72 * serum creatinine). The patient is 66 years old, so (140-66)=74. Serum creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. Plugging in: (74 * 1.04 * 64.4) / (72 * 5.09). Calculate numerator: 74*1.04=77. 77*64.4≈5,000. Denominator: 72*5.09≈366.48. 5,000 / 366.48 ≈13.64 mL/min. However, the formula uses 0.85 for females and 1.04 for males, and also includes an adjustment for race (0.993 for non-black patients). Wait, correction: The full formula is: [(140 - age) * (weight in kg) * (0.85 if female)] / (72 * serum creatinine) * (1.212 if black male, 1.157 if black female, otherwise 1.0 for non-black). Wait, perhaps I misapplied the constants. Let me recheck the Cockcroft-Gault formula accurately. The correct formula for males is: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (0.818 * serum creatinine). But there are additional factors for race and gender. Alternatively, the standard formula is: (140 - age) * weight * (0.85 for female) / (0.818 * serum creatinine) * 1.04 for males. Wait, perhaps the exact formula is: For males: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (1.73 * serum creatinine) * 1.23. Wait, confusion arises. Let me refer to the standard Cockcroft-Gault equation. The correct formula is: For men: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (72 * serum creatinine) * 1.04. For women, multiply by 0.85. Additionally, for black patients, multiply by 1.1. Since the patient is Japanese (non-black), no race adjustment. So, using the patient's adjusted weight (64.4 kg): [(140 - 66) * 64.4] / (72 * 5.09) * 1.04. Compute step by step: 140-66=74. 74 * 64.4 = 4,763.6. 4,763.6 * 1.04 ≈ 4,954. 72 *5.09≈366.48. 4,954 / 366.48 ≈13.52 mL/min. However, the ideal body weight calculation might be different. Some sources use 50 + 0.9*(height in cm - 152) for men. As calculated earlier, that gives 64.4 kg. Since BMI is 23.8 (normal), adjusted weight is 64.4 kg. Thus, the final calculation gives approximately 13.5 mL/min.", "answer": "13.5"}
{'Row Number': 11, 'Calculator Name': 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Calculator ID': '2', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6331344-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '147.058', 'LLM Raw Thinking': "Step 1: Identify the patient's creatinine value and the Cockcroft-Gault Equation formula. The patient's creatinine value is 5.09 mg/dL. The Cockcroft-Gault Equation formula is: C = (140 - age) * (0.85 if female, 1.04 if male) * (0.742 if black, 1.204 if Asian) * (0.993 if male, 0.993 if female) * (weight in kg) / (72 * serum creatinine in mg/dL). ", 'LLM Explanation': "The patient's creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation. The patient's creatinine value is 5.09 mg/dL, and their adjusted body weight is 68 kg. The Cockcroft-Gault Equation formula was applied to calculate the creatinine clearance. The result is 147.058 mL/min.", 'Target Model': 'Qwen/QwQ-32B', 'Target Answer': '13.5', 'Target Explanation': "First, I need to calculate the patient's BMI to determine if his weight should be adjusted. His height is 168 cm and weight is 68 kg. BMI = (weight (kg) / (height (m))^2) = 68 / (1.68)^2 ≈ 23.8. Since the normal BMI range is 18.5-24.9, his BMI is within the normal range. Therefore, his adjusted body weight is the minimum of his actual weight (68 kg) and his ideal body weight. Ideal body weight for a male is typically calculated as 50 + 0.9*(height in cm - 152). So, 50 + 0.9*(168-152) = 50 + 14.4 = 64.4 kg. Thus, adjusted weight is 64.4 kg. Next, apply the Cockcroft-Gault formula for males: (140 - age) * (1.04) * (adjusted weight) / (72 * serum creatinine). The patient is 66 years old, so (140-66)=74. Serum creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. Plugging in: (74 * 1.04 * 64.4) / (72 * 5.09). Calculate numerator: 74*1.04=77. 77*64.4≈5,000. Denominator: 72*5.09≈366.48. 5,000 / 366.48 ≈13.64 mL/min. However, the formula uses 0.85 for females and 1.04 for males, and also includes an adjustment for race (0.993 for non-black patients). Wait, correction: The full formula is: [(140 - age) * (weight in kg) * (0.85 if female)] / (72 * serum creatinine) * (1.212 if black male, 1.157 if black female, otherwise 1.0 for non-black). Wait, perhaps I misapplied the constants. Let me recheck the Cockcroft-Gault formula accurately. The correct formula for males is: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (0.818 * serum creatinine). But there are additional factors for race and gender. Alternatively, the standard formula is: (140 - age) * weight * (0.85 for female) / (0.818 * serum creatinine) * 1.04 for males. Wait, perhaps the exact formula is: For males: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (1.73 * serum creatinine) * 1.23. Wait, confusion arises. Let me refer to the standard Cockcroft-Gault equation. The correct formula is: For men: [(140 - age) * weight (kg)] / (72 * serum creatinine) * 1.04. For women, multiply by 0.85. Additionally, for black patients, multiply by 1.1. Since the patient is Japanese (non-black), no race adjustment. So, using the patient's adjusted weight (64.4 kg): [(140 - 66) * 64.4] / (72 * 5.09) * 1.04. Compute step by step: 140-66=74. 74 * 64.4 = 4,763.6. 4,763.6 * 1.04 ≈ 4,954. 72 *5.09≈366.48. 4,954 / 366.48 ≈13.52 mL/min. However, the ideal body weight calculation might be different. Some sources use 50 + 0.9*(height in cm - 152) for men. As calculated earlier, that gives 64.4 kg. Since BMI is 23.8 (normal), adjusted weight is 64.4 kg. Thus, the final calculation gives approximately 13.5 mL/min.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '12.949', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 12.949 mL/min.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Correct'} 65%|██████▌   | 65/100 [1:16:05<46:47, 80.22s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL).

Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads ().

Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. </think> Wait, actually, I might have made a mistake there. Let me recall Naegele's Rule properly. The correct method is to add 280 days (which is 40 weeks) to the LMP. Alternatively, the rule is often simplified as adding 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then adding 9 months. But since the cycle length here is 28 days, which is regular, the standard rule applies. Starting with LMP of 05/20/2020. First, add 9 months to that date. Adding 9 months to May 20 would bring us to February 20, 2021. Then add 7 days. February 20 plus 7 days is February 27, 2021. Wait, but hold on—if you add 9 months to May 20, 2020, the month becomes February 20, 2021. Then adding 7 days: 20 +7 =27. So the due date would be 02/27/2021. Alternatively, another way is to add 280 days. Let me check that way. Let's count days from May 20, 2020. May has 31 days, so from May 20 to May 31 is 12 days. June has 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, January 31, and then part of February. Wait, maybe it's easier to use a date calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle length of 28 days is already considered in the standard Naegele's rule, which assumes a 28-day cycle. Since the cycle here is exactly 28 days, the standard calculation applies. So the correct due date should be 02/27/2021. Wait, but let me confirm again. The standard steps are: take the first day of LMP, add 9 months and 7 days. So May 20 plus 9 months is February 20, then add 7 days: February 27. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 02/27/2021. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule: 1. Start with the last menstrual period (LMP) of 05/20/2020. 2.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

<think> To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate the patient's eye, verbal, and motor responses. The GCS is calculated as follows: 1. Eye Response: - 4 points for open eyes - 3 points for eye opening to pain - 2 points for eye opening to verbal command - 1 point for no eye opening - 0 points for no eye opening to pain or verbal command 2. Verbal Response: - 5 points for oriented and conversational - 4 points for confused, but able to answer questions - 3 points for incomprehensible sounds - 2 points for groaning or moaning - 1 point for no verbal response 3. Motor Response: - 6 points for obeying commands - 5 points for localizing pain - 4 points for withdrawal to pain - 3 points for flexion to pain - 2 points for extension to pain - 1 point for no motor response </think>

First, the eye response: The note states "Her eyes open upon painful stimulus." This indicates that the eyes open in response to pain, which corresponds to 3 points for the eye component. Next, the verbal response: The note mentions "Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated." Grunting or moaning without coherent speech falls under the category of 2 points for verbal response. For the motor response: "A pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities." Withdrawal to pain is a 4-point score in the motor component. Adding these together: 3 (eyes) + 2 (verbal) + 4 (motor) = 9. Wait, but let me double-check the verbal component. The options for verbal are: 3 points for incomprehensible sounds, 2 points for groaning. Since the patient is grunting/moaning, that's 2 points. So yes, that's correct. The motor response is withdrawal to pain, which is 4. So total is indeed 3+2+4=9.

Step 1: Convert the last menstrual period date to a date object. Step 2: Add 7 days to the last menstrual period date. Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. </think> Wait, actually, I might have made a mistake there. Let me recall Naegele's Rule properly. The correct method is to add 280 days (which is 40 weeks) to the LMP. Alternatively, the simplified method is to add 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then add 9 months. But if the cycle length isn't 28 days, you adjust by adding or subtracting the difference from 28 days. Since the cycle here is 25 days, which is 3 days shorter, you subtract 3 days from the due date. Wait, let me get this straight. The standard Naegele's Rule assumes a 28-day cycle. If the cycle is shorter, you subtract the difference from 28; if longer, you add. So starting with LMP of 04/09/2021. First, add 7 days: 04/09 +7 = 04/16. Then add 9 months: 01/16/2022. But since the cycle is 25 days (3 days less than 28), subtract 3 days from that due date. So 01/16/2022 minus 3 days is 01/13/2022. Wait, but another way: Alternatively, the formula is LMP date plus 280 days, but adjusted for cycle length. So 280 days minus (28 - cycle length). Since cycle is 25, subtract 3 days. So 280 -3 = 277 days. Let me check both methods. First method: Original Naegele's gives 04/09/2021 + 280 days. Let's compute that. 04/09 + 9 months is Jan 9, plus 7 days is Jan 16. Alternatively, adding 280 days directly. Let me count the days step by step. April has 30 days, so from April 9 to April 30: 21 days. May:31, June:30, July:31, August:31, September:30, October:31, November:30, December:31, January:? Wait, maybe better to use a date calculator approach. Let's see: Starting from 04/09/2021. Adding 280 days: April has 30 days. From April 9 to April 30: 21 days left in April (30-9=21? Wait, April 9 is day 9, so 30-8=22 days remaining? Wait, April 9 is the 9th, so days remaining after April 9: 30 -9 =21 days. So adding 21 days brings us to April 30. Then remaining days: 280-21=259. May has 31: 259-31=228 June 30: 228-30=198 July 31: 198-31=167 August 31: 167-31=136 September 30: 136-30=106 October 31: 106-31=75 November 30: 75-30=45 December 31: 45-31=14 So January 14, 2022. Wait, but that's 280 days? Let me check again: Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me try another way. Alternatively, using the standard Naegele's method: add 9 months and 7 days. Original LMP: April 9, 2021. Adding 9 months brings us to January 9, 2022. Then adding 7 days: January 16, 2022. But since the cycle is 25 days (3 days shorter than 28), we subtract 3 days from that due date. So 1/16/2022 minus 3 days is 1/13/2022. Alternatively, if the cycle is shorter, the ovulation occurs earlier, so the due date would be earlier. So that adjustment makes sense. Therefore, the correct due date should be 1/13/2022. Wait, but let me confirm the adjustment method. Some sources say that if the cycle is not 28 days, you adjust the LMP by adding or subtracting the difference between 28 and the cycle length. For example, if the cycle is 25 days, subtract 3 days from the LMP before applying Naegele's rule. Wait, that might be another approach. Let me see: If the cycle is shorter than 28 days, the ovulation occurs earlier, so conception would be earlier, so the due date would be earlier. Therefore, to adjust, you subtract (28 - cycle length) days from the LMP before applying the rule. So original LMP is 04/09/2021. Since cycle is 25, subtract 3 days: 04/06/2021.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1. On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography.
Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission. Warfarin was initiated and the follow-up was uneventful.

THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results and the task The patient's laboratory results show that her serum creatinine is 3.99 mg/dL, and we need to calculate her serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating serum osmolality Serum osmolality is calculated using the formula: osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x sodium) + (glucose/18) + (protein/0.012) + (chloride/36.5) + (bun/2.8). Step 3: Extract the necessary values from the patient's laboratory results - Sodium: 130 mmol/L - Glucose: 83.9 mg/dL - Protein: 5.4 mg/dL - Chloride: Not directly provided, but we can calculate it from the anion gap (AG) formula: AG = (sodium + chloride) - (protein + glucose). However, we don't have the chloride value directly, but we can use the anion gap formula to estimate it. The anion gap is 123.7 s (aPTT) - 26-32 s (normal range) = 97.7 s, which is approximately 97.7/40.1 = 2.44 mEq/L. Since the anion gap is approximately equal to the chloride value, we can estimate the chloride value as 130 mmol/L + 2.44 mEq/L = 132.44 mmol/L. We will use 132 mmol/L as the chloride value for simplicity. - Bun (BUN): 163.9 mg/dL Step 4: Plug the values into the formula osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x 130 mmol/L) + (83.9 mg/dL / 18) + (5.4 mg/dL / 0.012) + (132 mmol/L / 36.5) + (163.9 mg/dL / 2.8) Step 5: Perform the calculations osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (260) + (4.64) + (450) + (3.62) + (58.36) = 776.98 mOsm/kg

On the second day after pericardiocentesis, hemorrhagic fluid flow via drainage catheter persisted and additional fresh frozen plasma transfusion was administered. Subsequently, PT was 25.3 s, aPTT 77,5 and INR was 2.3. Pericardial drainage was terminated after achievement of no flow through catheter and no pericardial effusion on control echocardiography. Laboratory tests repeated on the fourth day of admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 109 mg/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 1.4 and hemoglobin 12 g/dL. The patient was extubated after improved ventilation parameters. Dabigatran etexilate was omitted and other medications were continued. She was discharged 10 days after admission.

However, we don't have the chloride value directly, but we can use the anion gap formula to estimate it. The anion gap is 123.7 s (aPTT) - 26-32 s (normal range) = 97.7 s, which is approximately 97.7/40.1 = 2.44 mEq/L. Since the anion gap is approximately equal to the chloride value, we can estimate the chloride value as 130 mmol/L + 2.44 mEq/L = 132.44 mmol/L. We will use 132 mmol/L as the chloride value for simplicity. - Bun (BUN): 163.9 mg/dL Step 4: Plug the values into the formula osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (2 x 130 mmol/L) + (83.9 mg/dL / 18) + (5.4 mg/dL / 0.012) + (132 mmol/L / 36.5) + (163.9 mg/dL / 2.8) Step 5: Perform the calculations osmolality (mOsm/kg) = (260) + (4.64) + (450) + (3.62) + (58.36) = 776.98 mOsm/kg </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "Step 1: The task requires calculating the patient's serum osmolality.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

<think> To calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), we need to assign a score to each comorbidity present in the patient's medical history and then sum them up. The CCI scoring system assigns points as follows: - 1 point for each of the following comorbidities: - Malignancy (cancer) - Congestive heart failure - Peripheral vascular disease - Dementia - Connective tissue disease - Chronic kidney disease - Liver disease - Respiratory disease (not specified, but we'll assume it's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD) - 2 points for each of the following comorbidities: - Diabetes - Leukemia - HIV/AIDS - Stroke - 3 points for each of the following comorbidities: - Severe liver disease - Peptic ulcer disease - Severe mental or behavioral disorder - Severe renal disease - Severe respiratory disease -

First, I need to recall the components of the CCI. The CCI includes various comorbidities each assigned a specific weight or points. The main conditions are things like myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer disease, mild liver disease, diabetes (with or without complications), hemiplegia, moderate or severe renal disease, diabetes with end organ damage, tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, moderate or severe liver disease, and AIDS. Each of these has a point value, usually 1, 2, or 6 points, depending on severity. Now, looking at the patient's note, let's list out all the conditions mentioned and see which ones are part of the CCI. The patient is a 76-year-old male with several comorbidities. Let's go through each one: 1. **Hepatoblastoma**: This is a type of liver cancer. The CCI includes malignancies (other than lymphoma, leukemia, or metastatic cancer) as 1 point. However, since he's in remission, does that matter? Wait, the CCI counts active cancer unless specified otherwise. The note says he's been in remission since treatment completion. I think active cancer counts, but if it's in remission, maybe it's excluded? Hmm, need to check. The standard CCI includes "malignant tumor" (other than hematologic) as 1 point, but if it's in remission for more than 5 years, it might not be counted. The note doesn't specify how long he's been in remission, but since it's part of his past medical history, maybe it's considered. Alternatively, hepatoblastoma is a rare cancer, but the CCI might just count any cancer unless specified. Let me note this as a possible 1 point, but need to confirm. 2. **Leukemia**: Leukemia is specifically listed in the CCI as 1 point. Wait, no, actually, the CCI has leukemia as a separate category. Wait, checking again: The Charlson index includes leukemia as a separate comorbidity with a weight of 1 point. Wait, no, actually, I think leukemia is 1 point. Wait, let me recall: The Charlson Comorbidity Index includes the following with their points: - Myocardial infarction: 1 - Congestive heart failure: 1 - Peripheral vascular disease: 1 - Cerebrovascular disease: 1 - Dementia: 1 - Chronic pulmonary disease: 1 - Connective tissue disease: 1 - Peptic ulcer disease: 1 - Mild liver disease: 1 - Diabetes (without complications): 1 - Diabetes (with complications): 2 - Hemiplegia: 2 - Moderate or severe renal disease: 2 - Leukemia: 2 points? Wait, no, I might be mixing up. Let me get this right. Wait, perhaps I should refer to the exact list. The Charlson Comorbidity Index includes the following conditions and their points: - Myocardial infarction: 1 - Congestive heart failure: 1 - Peripheral vascular disease: 1 - Cerebrovascular disease: 1 - Dementia: 1 - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): 1 - Connective tissue disease: 1 - Peptic ulcer disease: 1 - Mild liver disease: 1 - Diabetes mellitus: 1 (if uncomplicated) - Diabetes mellitus with end organ damage: 2 - Renal disease: 1 (moderate) or 2 (severe) - Leukemia: 2 points - Lymphoma: 1 point - Mild liver disease: 1 - Moderate or severe liver disease: 3 points - AIDS: 6 points Wait, I might have some confusion here. Let me confirm the exact points. According to the standard Charlson Index: The comorbidities and their points are: 1. Myocardial infarction: 1 2. Congestive heart failure: 1 3. Peripheral vascular disease: 1 4. Cerebrovascular disease: 1 5. Dementia: 1 6. Chronic pulmonary disease (COPD): 1 7. Connective tissue disease: 1 8. Peptic ulcer disease: 1 9. Mild liver disease: 1 10. Diabetes mellitus (uncomplicated): 1 11. Diabetes mellitus with end organ damage: 2 12. Renal disease (moderate): 1, (severe): 2 13. Leukemia: 2 14. Lymphoma: 1 15. Moderate or severe liver disease: 3 16. AIDS: 6 Okay, so leukemia is 2 points. So the patient has leukemia, so that's 2 points. 3. **Congestive heart failure (CHF)**: That's 1 point. 4. **Type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated**: Since it's uncomplicated, that's 1 point. 5. **Dementia**: 1 point. 6. **Severe liver disease**: The note says "signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease". Severe liver disease is 3 points. 7. **Status post cerebral vascular accident (CVA)**: Cerebrovascular disease (CVA) is 1 point. Even if he had no residual deficits, the CVA itself counts. So that's 1 point. 8. **Connective tissue disease**: 1 point. The patient denies having transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), but since he had a CVA, that's already counted. The note also states he has no chronic kidney disease, AIDS, peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or COPD. So those are excluded. Now, let's list all the applicable conditions and their points: - Leukemia: 2 - Congestive heart failure: 1 - Diabetes (uncomplicated): 1 - Dementia: 1 - Severe liver disease: 3 - Cerebrovascular disease (CVA): 1 - Connective tissue disease: 1 Wait, what about the hepatoblastoma? The patient had hepatoblastoma but is in remission. The CCI includes "malignant tumor" (other than hematologic malignancies like leukemia/lymphoma) as 1 point. Since hepatoblastoma is a solid tumor, even in remission, does it count? The standard is that malignancies (other than hematologic) are counted if they are present within the past 10 years, or if they are active. Since the note says he's been in remission since treatment completion, but doesn't specify how long ago, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, if it's a past malignancy in remission, it might not be counted unless it's within a certain timeframe. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should include it as a malignancy (1 point). Alternatively, if the remission is long-term, maybe not. The question is whether hepatoblastoma is considered here. Since the note mentions it as part of his medical history, perhaps it's included. Let me check again. The Charlson index includes "malignant tumor" (other than hematologic) as 1 point. So if he has a history of hepatoblastoma (a solid tumor), even in remission, it would count as 1 point. Unless the remission is beyond a certain period, but the problem doesn't specify. Since the note says "he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen," but we don't know how long ago that was. Since the question is presented as a test, perhaps we should include it as a malignancy (1 point). So adding that: - Malignant tumor (hepatoblastoma): 1 Now, let's recalculate with that: Leukemia: 2 CHF:1 Diabetes:1 Dementia:1 Severe liver disease:3 CVA:1 Connective tissue disease:1 Hepatoblastoma (malignant tumor):1 Total points: 2+1+1+1+3+1+1+1 = 10? Wait, let's add again: Leukemia (2) + CHF (1) = 3 + Diabetes (1) → 4 + Dementia (1) →5 + Severe liver (3) →8 + CVA (1) →9 + Connective tissue (1) →10 + Hepatoblastoma (1) →11. Wait, so total would be 11? But I need to confirm if hepatoblastoma is counted. Alternatively, maybe the hepatoblastoma is considered part of the liver disease? The note mentions "severe liver disease" as a separate condition, so the malignancy (hepatoblastoma) is a separate condition. So yes, it's an additional point. Wait, but hepatoblastoma is a type of liver cancer. The CCI's "malignant tumor" category excludes hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma), so hepatoblastoma would count as a malignant tumor (1 point). So that's correct. So total points would be 2 (leukemia) +1 (CHF) +1 (diabetes) +1 (dementia) +3 (severe liver) +1 (CVA) +1 (connective tissue) +1 (hepatoblastoma) = 11 points. Wait, but let me check again each condition: - Leukemia: 2 - CHF:1 - Diabetes (uncomplicated):1 - Dementia:1 - Severe liver disease:3 - CVA:1 - Connective tissue disease:1 - Malignant tumor (hepatoblastoma):1 Total: 2+1=3; +1=4; +1=5; +3=8; +1=9; +1=10; +1=11. So 11. But wait, the note says "severe liver disease contributing to his complicated health status." The severe liver disease is 3 points. The hepatoblastoma is a separate condition (malignant tumor, 1 point). So that's correct. However, I need to make sure that the severe liver disease isn't overlapping. Since hepatoblastoma is a liver cancer, but the severe liver disease is a separate condition. The CCI's "malignant tumor" is separate from liver disease. So yes, both count. Therefore, the total CCI is 11. Wait, but let me check again the list of conditions in the note: The patient's conditions: - Hepatoblastoma (in remission) → malignant tumor (1) - Leukemia (managed with therapy) → leukemia (2) - CHF → 1 - Type II DM uncomplicated →1 - Dementia →1 - Severe liver disease →3 - CVA →1 - Connective tissue disease →1 No other conditions mentioned that are part of CCI. So adding all those gives 1+2+1+1+1+3+1+1 = 11. Therefore, the CCI score is 11. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is calculated by assigning points to specific comorbidities.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

Here is the task:
Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?

THINKING USED Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant information. The patient's weight is 30 kg, and we need to calculate the maintenance fluid in mL/hr. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating maintenance fluid. The formula for calculating maintenance fluid is: Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (body weight (kg) x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr. Step 3: Plug in the patient's weight into the formula. Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (30 kg x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr = 1250 mL/hr. Step 4: Convert the result to a more meaningful unit if necessary. No conversion is necessary in this case. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's maintenance fluid is calculated by multiplying their weight in kg by 1000 mL/kg and then dividing by 24 hours. The result is 1250 mL/hr.", "answer": "1250"}

Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

<think>Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant information. The patient's weight is 30 kg, and we need to calculate the maintenance fluid in mL/hr. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating maintenance fluid. The formula for calculating maintenance fluid is: Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (body weight (kg) x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr. Step 3: Plug in the patient's weight into the formula. Maintenance fluid (mL/hr) = (30 kg x 1000 mL/kg) / 24 hr = 1250 mL/hr. Step 4: Convert the result to a more meaningful unit if necessary. No conversion is necessary in this case. The final answer is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's maintenance fluid is calculated by multiplying their weight in kg by 1000 mL/kg and then dividing by 24 hours.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene). The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2. At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified.

<think> To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we need to add 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period and then add the cycle length. Step 1: Convert the last menstrual period date to a date object. Step 2: Add 7 days to the last menstrual period date. Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. </think>

Step 1: Convert the last menstrual period date to a date object. Step 2: Add 7 days to the last menstrual period date. Step 3: Add the cycle length to the result from step 2. </think> Wait, actually, I might have made a mistake there. Let me recall Naegele's Rule properly. The correct method is to add 280 days (which is 40 weeks) to the LMP. Alternatively, the simplified method is to add 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then add 9 months. But the cycle length comes into play if it's not a standard 28-day cycle. Since the cycle here is 30 days, which is longer than 28, we need to adjust by adding the difference. Wait, let me get this straight. The standard Naegele's Rule assumes a 28-day cycle. If the cycle is longer, you add the difference between the actual cycle length and 28 days to the due date. So here, the cycle is 30 days, so 30-28=2 days. Therefore, the due date would be the standard calculation plus 2 days. First, let's compute the standard due date assuming a 28-day cycle. The LMP is 03/24/2017. Adding 7 days gives 04/01/2017, then adding 9 months brings us to 12/01/2017. But wait, adding 9 months to March would be December, so 03/24 + 9 months is 12/24, then adding 7 days would be 12/31? Hmm, maybe I need to do it step by step correctly. Alternatively, the standard method is to add 9 months and 7 days to the LMP. So starting from 03/24/2017, adding 9 months would be 12/24/2017, then adding 7 days gives 12/31/2017. But since the cycle is 30 days, which is 2 days longer than 28, we need to add those 2 days. So 12/31 + 2 days = 01/02/2018. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me check again. Wait, actually, the adjustment for cycle length is only necessary if the cycle is not 28 days. The formula is: Due Date = LMP + 280 days. But when using the 9 months and 7 days method, it's already assuming a 28-day cycle. So if the cycle is longer, you add the difference between the cycle length and 28 days to the due date. So in this case, cycle is 30 days, so 30-28=2 days. Therefore, the due date would be 2 days later than the standard calculation. So first, compute the standard due date: LMP 03/24/2017 plus 9 months and 7 days. Adding 9 months to March 24 is December 24, then adding 7 days: December 24 +7 = December 31, 2017. Then add 2 days (because cycle is 30 days) to get January 2, 2018. Wait, but let me confirm the exact steps again. Let me do the math step by step. Original LMP: 03/24/2017. Standard Naegele's: Add 9 months and 7 days. Adding 9 months to March 24: March +9 months is December, so December 24, 2017. Then add 7 days: December 24 +7 = December 31, 2017. Now, since the cycle is 30 days, which is 2 days longer than 28, we add those 2 days. So December 31 +2 days = January 2, 2018. Therefore, the estimated due date should be 01/02/2018. Wait, but I need to make sure that the adjustment is indeed adding the difference. Let me check a reference. According to Naegele's Rule adjustment for cycle length: If the cycle is longer than 28 days, add the difference to the due date. For example, if cycle is 32 days, add 4 days. So yes, in this case, 30-28=2, so add 2 days. Therefore, the final due date is 01/02/2018. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule: 1.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's body mass index (BMI), we need to use the formula: BMI = weight (in kg) / height (in meters)². First, we need to convert the patient's weight and height from the given units to metric units. The patient's weight is 42 kg and the height is 145 cm. We need to convert the height from centimeters to meters. 1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 145 cm = 1.45 meters. Now we can calculate the BMI: BMI = 42 kg / (1.45 m)² = 42 kg / 2.1025 m² = 20.0 kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise. His presentation poses several noteworthy elements for his care-continuum, requiring diligent medical management and monitoring.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL (1 point), bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL (1 point), INR 1.8 (1 point). No ascites or encephalopathy is explicitly mentioned, so 1 point each for those (assuming none). Total: 1+1+1+1+1=5. Wait, but encephalopathy is mentioned (confusion, asterixis), so encephalopathy is present (grade 1-2 = 1 point). Ascites not mentioned, so 1 point. Total: 1 (albumin) +1 (bilirubin) +1 (INR) +1 (ascites) +1 (encephalopathy) = 5. However, the INR of 1.8 is within normal range (normal INR is 0.8-1.2), but Child-Pugh uses INR cutoffs: <1.7=1, 1.7-2.3=2, >2.3=3. Wait, the INR here is 1.8, which falls into 1.7-2.3, so that's 2 points. Let me recalculate: Albumin 3.1 (1), Bilirubin 1.9 (1), INR 1.8 (2), Ascites (1, none), Encephalopathy (1, present). Total: 1+1+2+1+1=6. Wait, but the Child-Pugh categories for each parameter: Albumin: >35 g/L (3.5 g/dL) is 1 point. The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL (31 g/L), which is <35, so that's 2 points. Wait, I made a mistake here. Let me check the exact Child-Pugh criteria again. Albumin: >35 g/L (1), 25-35 (2), <25 (3). The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL, which is 31 g/L (since 1 g/dL = 10 g/L). So 31 g/L is between 25-35, so 2 points. Bilirubin: <2 mg/dL (1), 2-3 (2), >3 (3). The patient's is 1.9, so 1 point. INR: <1.7 (1), 1.7-2.3 (2), >2.3 (3). The patient's INR is 1.8, so 2 points. Ascites: None (1), Slight (2), Moderate (3). Not mentioned, so assume 1. Encephalopathy: None (1), Grade I-II (2), Grade III-IV (3). The patient has confusion and asterixis, which is encephalopathy grade I-II, so 2 points. Now total: Albumin 2 + Bilirubin 1 + INR 2 + Ascites 1 + Encephalopathy 2 = 8. Wait, that's different. Let me confirm each parameter again. Albumin: 3.1 g/dL is 31 g/L. The cutoff for Child-Pugh is: Albumin (g/L): >35 (1), 25-35 (2), <25 (3). So 31 is 2 points. Bilirubin (mg/dL): <2 (1), 2-3 (2), >3 (3). 1.9 is 1 point. INR: 1.8 is in 1.7-2.3, so 2 points. Ascites: Not mentioned, so 1. Encephalopathy: Confusion and asterixis are signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is at least grade I-II, so 2 points. Total: 2+1+2+1+2=8.

Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.', 'Question': "What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '3', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin level, bilirubin level, INR, prothrombin time, and ascites. The score ranges from 5 to 15, with higher scores indicating more severe liver disease. 1. Albumin level: The patient's albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL corresponds to 1 point. 2. Bilirubin level: The patient's bilirubin level is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, a bilirubin level of 1.9 mg/dL corresponds to 1 point. 3. INR: The patient's INR value is 1.8. According to the Child-Pugh scoring system, an INR value of 1.8 corresponds to 1 point. 4. Prothrombin time: The patient's prothrombin time is not mentioned in the note. However, we can assume that it is within normal limits since the INR value is 1.8, which is within the normal range for most patients. 5. Ascites: The note does not mention ascites, so we will assume it is absent. Now, let's calculate the total Child-Pugh Score: 1 (albumin) + 1 (bilirubin) + 1 (INR) = 3 Since the prothrombin time and ascites are not mentioned, we will not add any points for them. ", 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we evaluated the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin level, bilirubin level, INR, prothrombin time, and ascites. We assigned 1 point for each parameter with the given values: albumin level (3.1 g/dL), bilirubin level (1.9 mg/dL), and INR (1.8). The prothrombin time and ascites were not mentioned, so we did not add any points for them. The total Child-Pugh Score is 3.", 'Target Model': 'Qwen/QwQ-32B', 'Target Answer': '8', 'Target Explanation': "The Child-Pugh Score evaluates liver function using five parameters: albumin, bilirubin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy. The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL (1 point), bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL (1 point), INR 1.8 (1 point). No ascites or encephalopathy is explicitly mentioned, so 1 point each for those (assuming none). Total: 1+1+1+1+1=5. Wait, but encephalopathy is mentioned (confusion, asterixis), so encephalopathy is present (grade 1-2 = 1 point). Ascites not mentioned, so 1 point. Total: 1 (albumin) +1 (bilirubin) +1 (INR) +1 (ascites) +1 (encephalopathy) = 5. However, the INR of 1.8 is within normal range (normal INR is 0.8-1.2), but Child-Pugh uses INR cutoffs: <1.7=1, 1.7-2.3=2, >2.3=3. Wait, the INR here is 1.8, which falls into 1.7-2.3, so that's 2 points. Let me recalculate: Albumin 3.1 (1), Bilirubin 1.9 (1), INR 1.8 (2), Ascites (1, none), Encephalopathy (1, present). Total: 1+1+2+1+1=6. Wait, but the Child-Pugh categories for each parameter: Albumin: >35 g/L (3.5 g/dL) is 1 point. The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL (31 g/L), which is <35, so that's 2 points. Wait, I made a mistake here. Let me check the exact Child-Pugh criteria again. Albumin: >35 g/L (1), 25-35 (2), <25 (3). The patient's albumin is 3.1 g/dL, which is 31 g/L (since 1 g/dL = 10 g/L). So 31 g/L is between 25-35, so 2 points. Bilirubin: <2 mg/dL (1), 2-3 (2), >3 (3). The patient's is 1.9, so 1 point. INR: <1.7 (1), 1.7-2.3 (2), >2.3 (3). The patient's INR is 1.8, so 2 points. Ascites: None (1), Slight (2), Moderate (3). Not mentioned, so assume 1. Encephalopathy: None (1), Grade I-II (2), Grade III-IV (3). The patient has confusion and asterixis, which is encephalopathy grade I-II, so 2 points. Now total: Albumin 2 + Bilirubin 1 + INR 2 + Ascites 1 + Encephalopathy 2 = 8. Wait, that's different. Let me confirm each parameter again. Albumin: 3.1 g/dL is 31 g/L. The cutoff for Child-Pugh is: Albumin (g/L): >35 (1), 25-35 (2), <25 (3). So 31 is 2 points. Bilirubin (mg/dL): <2 (1), 2-3 (2), >3 (3). 1.9 is 1 point. INR: 1.8 is in 1.7-2.3, so 2 points. Ascites: Not mentioned, so 1. Encephalopathy: Confusion and asterixis are signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is at least grade I-II, so 2 points. Total: 2+1+2+1+2=8. Therefore, Child-Pugh score is 8, which corresponds to Class B.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '9', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current child pugh score is 0.\nThe patient's INR is 1.8. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is less than 2 mg/dL, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.\nThe Ascites state not specified, assuming and so we will assume it to be absent. This means we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 5 + 1 = 6.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 3-4 encephalopathy' and so we add three points to the score, making the current total 6 + 3 = 9.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 9.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3.

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

Let me check the formula again. Oh, no, the Broca formula is actually (height in cm × weight in kg) divided by 10000, but I might be mixing up different formulas. Let me confirm. The most common formula for BSA is the DuBois formula: BSA = 0.007184 × height(cm)^0.725 × weight(kg)^0.425. Alternatively, the Mosteller formula is simpler: sqrt( (height(cm) × weight(kg)) / 3600 ). Let me see which one is appropriate here. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the Mosteller formula as it's commonly used. The patient's height is 150 cm and weight is 32 kg. Applying Mosteller: BSA = sqrt( (150 * 32) / 3600 ) First calculate 150 * 32 = 4800 Then divide by 3600: 4800 / 3600 = 1.3333... Take the square root of that: sqrt(1.3333) ≈ 1.1547 m². Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me double-check the calculation steps again. Yes, 150 times 32 is indeed 4800. Divided by 3600 gives 1.333..., square root is approximately 1.1547. Rounding to two decimal places would be 1.15 m². Alternatively, maybe the question expects using another formula? Let me check the Broca formula again. Broca's formula is (height in cm - 100) × 100 / 10000, but that's for estimating ideal weight. Maybe I confused it. Alternatively, the Mosteller is the standard for BSA.

 Here is the patient note:
A 58-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following the deterioration of his conscious state; currently, he is rated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10. He is presently on mechanical ventilation, with FiO₂ at 54 %, and his arterial blood gas shows a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. Furthermore, there are ongoing infusions of multiple vasopressors to maintain his hemodynamic stability, including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. His systolic and diastolic blood pressure recorded at 120 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg, respectively. Biochemical findings show creatinine measurement at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function, while the bilirubin level stood at 2.3 mg/dL. His platelet count is 175,000/µL. Over the past 24-hours, his urine output was 850 mL/day.

THINKING USED  To calculate the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, we need to evaluate the patient's status in six different organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological. The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more organ dysfunction. 1. Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which indicates respiratory failure. We will assign 2 points for this system. 2. Cardiovascular: The patient is on multiple vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic stability, which indicates cardiovascular instability. We will assign 2 points for this system. 3. Hepatic: The patient's bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, which is elevated. We will assign 1 point for this system. 4. Coagulation: The patient's platelet count is 175,000/µL, which is slightly low. We will assign 1 point for this system. 5. Renal: The patient's creatinine measurement is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function. We will assign 1 point for this system. 6. Neurological: The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score is 10, indicating severe brain injury. We will assign 3 points for this system. Now, let's calculate the total SOFA score: Respiratory: 2 points Cardiovascular: 2 points Hepatic: 1 point Coagulation: 1 point Renal: 1 point Neurological: 3 points Total SOFA score: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10

Here is the patient note:
A 58-year-old male was admitted to the ICU following the deterioration of his conscious state; currently, he is rated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10. He is presently on mechanical ventilation, with FiO₂ at 54 %, and his arterial blood gas shows a PaO₂ of 76 mm Hg. Furthermore, there are ongoing infusions of multiple vasopressors to maintain his hemodynamic stability, including norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. His systolic and diastolic blood pressure recorded at 120 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg, respectively. Biochemical findings show creatinine measurement at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating a slight deviation in renal function, while the bilirubin level stood at 2.3 mg/dL. His platelet count is 175,000/µL. Over the past 24-hours, his urine output was 850 mL/day.

A 69-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic alcohol use, and cirrhosis presented for a routine check. He was sober and although slight mental slowness and mild asterixis were present on exam, There was no evidence of ascites. The laboratory results revealed an INR of 1.9, increasing the concern for impaired liver function. His serum total bilirubin was 2.0 mg/dL and albumin was 3.2 g/dL, indicating diminished liver function. The patient's blood glucose was 120 mg/dL, raising the suspicion of prediabetes, and his creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL, indicating good renal function. He was ordered to abstain from alcohol consumption, maintain a balanced diet, and monitor his blood glucose regularly.

THINKING USED  To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin levels, bilirubin levels, prothrombin time (INR), ascites, and encephalopathy. The score ranges from 5 to 15, with higher scores indicating more severe liver disease. Step 1: Evaluate albumin levels. Albumin levels are used to assess the patient's nutritional status and liver synthetic function. A score of 3.5 or higher is considered normal, while a score below 3.5 indicates impaired liver function. In this case, the patient's albumin level is 3.2 g/dL, which is below 3.5, so we assign a score of 1. Step 2: Evaluate bilirubin levels. Bilirubin levels are used to assess liver function and the presence of liver disease. A score of 1.2 mg/dL or higher is considered elevated, while a score below 1.2 mg/dL is considered normal. In this case, the patient's bilirubin level is 2.0 mg/dL, which is above 1.2 mg/dL, so we assign a score of 2. Step 3: Evaluate prothrombin time (INR). INR is used to assess the patient's coagulation function. A score of 1.1 or higher is considered elevated, while a score below 1.1 is considered normal. In this case, the patient's INR is 1.9, which is above 1.1, so we assign a score of 2. Step 4: Evaluate ascites. Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is a sign of advanced liver disease. The presence or absence of ascites is assigned a score of 1 or 0, respectively. In this case, there is no evidence of ascites, so we assign a score of 0. Step 5: Evaluate encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is a sign of advanced liver disease, and its presence or absence is assigned a score of 1 or 0, respectively. In this case, the patient has mild asterixis, which is a sign of encephalopathy, so we assign a score of 1. Now, let's calculate the total Child-Pugh Score: Child-Pugh Score = Albumin score + 1.1 x (Bilirubin score) + 1.1 x (INR score) + Ascites score + Encephalopathy score = 1 + 1.1 x 2 + 1.1 x 2 + 0 + 1 = 1 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 0 + 1 = 6.4

His serum total bilirubin was 2.0 mg/dL and albumin was 3.2 g/dL, indicating diminished liver function. The patient's blood glucose was 120 mg/dL, raising the suspicion of prediabetes, and his creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL, indicating good renal function. He was ordered to abstain from alcohol consumption, maintain a balanced diet, and monitor his blood glucose regularly. His medications including diuretics and antihypertensives remained unaltered until his next appointment.", 'Question': "What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score?", 'LLM Model': 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', 'LLM Answer': '6.4', 'LLM Raw Thinking': " To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin levels, bilirubin levels, prothrombin time (INR), ascites, and encephalopathy. The score ranges from 5 to 15, with higher scores indicating more severe liver disease. Step 1: Evaluate albumin levels. Albumin levels are used to assess the patient's nutritional status and liver synthetic function. A score of 3.5 or higher is considered normal, while a score below 3.5 indicates impaired liver function. In this case, the patient's albumin level is 3.2 g/dL, which is below 3.5, so we assign a score of 1. Step 2: Evaluate bilirubin levels. Bilirubin levels are used to assess liver function and the presence of liver disease. A score of 1.2 mg/dL or higher is considered elevated, while a score below 1.2 mg/dL is considered normal. In this case, the patient's bilirubin level is 2.0 mg/dL, which is above 1.2 mg/dL, so we assign a score of 2. Step 3: Evaluate prothrombin time (INR). INR is used to assess the patient's coagulation function. A score of 1.1 or higher is considered elevated, while a score below 1.1 is considered normal. In this case, the patient's INR is 1.9, which is above 1.1, so we assign a score of 2. Step 4: Evaluate ascites. Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is a sign of advanced liver disease. The presence or absence of ascites is assigned a score of 1 or 0, respectively. In this case, there is no evidence of ascites, so we assign a score of 0. Step 5: Evaluate encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is a sign of advanced liver disease, and its presence or absence is assigned a score of 1 or 0, respectively. In this case, the patient has mild asterixis, which is a sign of encephalopathy, so we assign a score of 1. Now, let's calculate the total Child-Pugh Score: Child-Pugh Score = Albumin score + 1.1 x (Bilirubin score) + 1.1 x (INR score) + Ascites score + Encephalopathy score = 1 + 1.1 x 2 + 1.1 x 2 + 0 + 1 = 1 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 0 + 1 = 6.4 ", 'LLM Explanation': "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we evaluate the patient's liver function based on five clinical parameters: albumin levels, bilirubin levels, prothrombin time (INR), ascites, and encephalopathy. We assign scores of 1 for impaired liver function, 2 for elevated bilirubin levels, 2 for elevated INR, 0 for no ascites, and 1 for encephalopathy. The total Child-Pugh Score is calculated as follows: Albumin score + 1.1 x (Bilirubin score) + 1.1 x (INR score) + Ascites score + Encephalopathy score. In this case, the total Child-Pugh Score is 6.4.", 'Target Model': 'Qwen/QwQ-32B', 'Target Answer': '6', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the patient's liver function based on five parameters: albumin, bilirubin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy. \\n1. **Albumin**: 3.2 g/dL falls into the 2.8-3.4 range (score 1).\\n2. **Bilirubin**: 2.0 mg/dL is above 2.0 (score 2).\\n3. **INR**: 1.9 is between 1.2-1.7 (score 2).\\n4. **Ascites**: None (score 0).\\n5. **Encephalopathy**: Mild asterixis indicates grade 1 (score 1).\\nTotal score: 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 6. However, the Child-Pugh formula uses specific scoring ranges. The correct scoring for INR 1.9 is actually between 1.2-1.7 (score 2), and bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL is exactly at the cutoff for score 2. The total score is 1 (albumin) + 2 (bilirubin) + 2 (INR) + 0 (ascites) + 1 (encephalopathy) = 6. This corresponds to Child-Pugh Class A (5-6).", 'Ground Truth Answer': '6', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current child pugh score is 0.\nThe patient's INR is 1.9. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 2.0 mg/dL. The concentration of albumin is 3.2 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 6.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

However, since the question doesn't specify rounding, we can present the exact value. Let me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy. 1.56 squared is indeed 2.4336, and 44 divided by 2.4336 equals approximately 18.08. So the final BMI is around 18.1 kg/m².

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well. Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail. The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations. Here is the task: What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?

{'Row Number': 137, 'Calculator Name': "Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism", 'Calculator ID': '8', 'Category': 'risk', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6020350-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina.

Calculate the patient's BMI. 5. Determine the patient's smoking status. 6. Determine the patient's history of diabetes. 7. Determine the patient's history of heart disease. 8. Calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score. </think> Okay, let's start by recalling what the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) entails. The FRS estimates the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary heart disease (CHD), based on several risk factors. The original Framingham model includes age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, whether the patient is on BP medication, smoking status, and diabetes status. Looking at the patient's information: Age: 67 years old, female. Total cholesterol is 196 mg/dL, HDL is 50 mg/dL. LDL is given as 110, but I think for the Framingham score, they might use total and HDL instead of LDL. Wait, actually, the original Framingham model uses total cholesterol and HDL, not LDL. So I need to confirm that. Let me think. Yes, the original Framingham equation uses total cholesterol and HDL. So I should use those values here. Blood pressure: The patient's current BP is 140/85 mmHg. But since she's on antihypertensive medications (lisinopril and metoprolol), the Framingham score requires considering whether the patient is on treatment. The systolic BP is 140, but because she's on meds, the BP is considered as the measured value. Wait, actually, in the Framingham calculation, if the patient is on BP medication, you still use the measured BP. The presence of hypertension (whether treated or not) is part of the risk factors. Wait, no, the Framingham equation includes the systolic BP and whether the patient is on treatment. Let me check the exact variables. The Framingham equation variables for women are: age, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic BP, treatment for hypertension (yes/no), smoking, diabetes (yes/no). So for BP, it's the measured systolic BP, and then a separate variable for whether they're on treatment. So here, systolic BP is 140. She is on treatment (lisinopril and metoprolol are BP meds), so the hypertension treatment variable is yes. Smoking status: she does not smoke. So that's a no. Diabetes: the note doesn't mention diabetes. The patient has hypertension and takes meds for that, but no mention of diabetes. So diabetes is no. Total cholesterol is 196, HDL is 50. Now, the Framingham equation for women is a bit complex. The formula is a bit involved, using points assigned to each variable. Alternatively, maybe I can use the points system. Let me recall the points tables. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the points system. Let me think. The Framingham score uses a points system where each variable contributes a certain number of points, and the total points correspond to a 10-year risk percentage. For women, the variables are: 1. Age (years): 67. Looking at the age table for women, 65-69 would be the category. The points for age 65-69 are, let me recall. From the Framingham tables, for women, age 65-69 is 9 points. 2. Total cholesterol (mg/dL): 196. The total cholesterol categories for women: 196 is in the 200-239 range? Wait, 196 is just under 200. Wait, the categories are in 20 increments. Let me check. The total cholesterol categories for women in the Framingham points table: Total Cholesterol (mg/dL): - <160: 0 points - 160-199: 3 points - 200-239: 6 points - ≥240: 9 points Wait, 196 is in 160-199, so 3 points. 3. HDL (mg/dL): 50. For HDL in women: HDL: - <35: 9 points - 35-44: 4 points - 45-54: 0 points - ≥55: -1 point Her HDL is 50, so 45-54, which is 0 points. 4. Systolic BP (mmHg): 140. The systolic BP categories for women, considering whether on treatment: If on treatment for hypertension (which she is), the points are based on the measured BP plus an additional point for treatment. Wait, actually, the systolic BP points are calculated as follows: First, determine the systolic BP category. For women on treatment, the points for BP are calculated using the measured BP, and then add an extra point for being on treatment. Wait, let me get the exact breakdown. The systolic BP categories for women (regardless of treatment) are: Systolic BP (mmHg): - <120: 0 points - 120-129: 1 point - 130-139: 3 points - 140-159: 5 points - ≥160: 8 points But if the patient is on treatment for hypertension, you add an additional 1 point. So her systolic BP is 140. That falls into 140-159, which is 5 points. Since she is on treatment, add 1 more point, so total 6 points for BP. Wait, but I need to confirm. Let me think again. The Framingham points for systolic BP when on treatment: the points for the BP category plus an additional point for treatment. So yes, 140-159 is 5, plus 1 for treatment, total 6. 5. Smoking: she does not smoke, so 0 points. 6. Diabetes: no, so 0 points. Now, adding all the points: Age: 9 (65-69) Total Cholesterol: 3 (160-199) HDL: 0 (45-54) Systolic BP: 6 (140-159 + treatment) Smoking: 0 Diabetes: 0 Total points: 9 + 3 + 0 +6 +0 +0 = 18 points. Now, converting points to 10-year risk. For women, the points to risk conversion: Looking at the Framingham table for women, 18 points correspond to a 10-year risk of 10-11%. Wait, let me recall the exact table. The Framingham points to risk for women: Points: 18 would be in the 10-11% range. Let me check the standard table. Wait, here's a standard conversion (from the Framingham website or guidelines): For women: Points: 18 corresponds to 10% (maybe 10-11%?), but exact numbers can vary slightly depending on the source. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 10% for 18 points. Alternatively, maybe the points are as follows: Looking up a standard Framingham table: For example, from the original Framingham tables: Women's 10-year risk: Points: 18 would be 10% (since 16-17 is 8%, 18-19 is 10%, 20-21 is 12%, etc.) Wait, perhaps the exact table is needed. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the points are as follows: The Framingham Risk Score for women: Points: 18 would be 10% (since 16-17 is 8%, 18-19 is 10%, 20-21 is 12%, 22-23 is 14%, etc.) Therefore, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is 10% (or 10-11%). Wait, but the question asks for the Framingham Risk Score, which is the percentage. So the answer would be 10% or the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the points calculation. Let me double-check each component again. Age: 67 is in 65-69, which is 9 points. Correct. Total Cholesterol: 196 is in 160-199, so 3 points. Correct. HDL: 50 is in 45-54, so 0 points. Correct. Systolic BP: 140. Since she's on treatment, the BP points are calculated as follows: First, the BP category for 140 is 140-159, which is 5 points. Then add 1 point for treatment, so total 6. Correct. Smoking: 0. Correct. Diabetes: 0. Correct. Total points: 9+3+0+6+0+0=18. Yes, that's correct. Looking at the Framingham table for women, 18 points correspond to a 10% risk. Therefore, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is 10%. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score (FRS), we use the following variables:\n\n1. **Age**: 67 years (65-69 years = 9 points).\n2. **Total Cholesterol**: 196 mg/dL (160-199 mg/dL = 3 points).\n3. **HDL**: 50 mg/dL (45-54 mg/dL = 0 points).\n4. **Systolic BP**: 140 mmHg (140-159 mmHg = 5 points) + 1 point for hypertension treatment = 6 points.\n5. **Smoking**: No = 0 points.\n6. **Diabetes**: No = 0 points.\n\nTotal points: 9 + 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 = **18 points**. \n\nUsing the Framingham table for women, 18 points correspond to a **10% 10-year risk of CHD**.", "answer": "10%"}

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THINKING USED  Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results The patient's serum albumin level is 1.2 g/dL, and the normal range for albumin is 3.4-4.2 g/dL. To calculate the albumin corrected delta gap, we need to first calculate the albumin gap. Step 2: Calculate the albumin gap The albumin gap is calculated by subtracting the patient's albumin level from the upper limit of the normal range: albumin gap = 4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL = 3.0 g/dL. Step 3: Convert the albumin gap to mEq/L Since albumin is a protein, we need to convert the albumin gap from g/dL to mEq/L. The molecular weight of albumin is approximately 67,000 g/mol. We can use the following conversion factor: 1 g/dL = 0.015 mEq/mL. Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, we can convert the albumin gap from g/dL to mEq/L as follows: albumin gap (mEq/L) = albumin gap (g/dL) x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 3.0 g/dL x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/mL. Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, we can convert the albumin gap from mEq/L to mEq/L as follows: albumin gap (mEq/L) = albumin gap (mEq/mL) x 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/mL x 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/L x 1000 = 45 mEq/L. Step 4: Calculate the albumin corrected delta gap The albumin corrected delta gap is calculated by subtracting the patient's serum albumin level from the normal albumin level: albumin corrected delta gap = normal albumin level - patient's serum albumin level = 4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL = 3.0 g/dL. Converting this to mEq/L as before, we get albumin corrected delta gap = 3.0 g/dL x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/L.

Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

<think> Step 1: Understand the patient's laboratory results The patient's serum albumin level is 1.2 g/dL, and the normal range for albumin is 3.4-4.2 g/dL. To calculate the albumin corrected delta gap, we need to first calculate the albumin gap. Step 2: Calculate the albumin gap The albumin gap is calculated by subtracting the patient's albumin level from the upper limit of the normal range: albumin gap = 4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL = 3.0 g/dL. Step 3: Convert the albumin gap to mEq/L Since albumin is a protein, we need to convert the albumin gap from g/dL to mEq/L. The molecular weight of albumin is approximately 67,000 g/mol. We can use the following conversion factor: 1 g/dL = 0.015 mEq/mL. Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, we can convert the albumin gap from g/dL to mEq/L as follows: albumin gap (mEq/L) = albumin gap (g/dL) x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 3.0 g/dL x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/mL. Since there are 1000 mL in 1 L, we can convert the albumin gap from mEq/L to mEq/L as follows: albumin gap (mEq/L) = albumin gap (mEq/mL) x 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/mL x 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/L x 1000 = 45 mEq/L. Step 4: Calculate the albumin corrected delta gap The albumin corrected delta gap is calculated by subtracting the patient's serum albumin level from the normal albumin level: albumin corrected delta gap = normal albumin level - patient's serum albumin level = 4.2 g/dL - 1.2 g/dL = 3.0 g/dL. Converting this to mEq/L as before, we get albumin corrected delta gap = 3.0 g/dL x (0.015 mEq/mL) / 1000 mL/L = 0.045 mEq/L. </think>

Thus, the delta gap here would be 3 × 2.8 = 8.4 mEq/L.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 97%|█████████▋| 97/100 [1:38:58<03:17, 65.68s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography). Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and COVID-19, and has experienced multiple episodes of pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. The patient's current presentation includes a large pericardial effusion, evidence of tamponade physiology, and a history of previous pericardial window placement and chest tube insertion. Step 2: Identify the relevant criteria for the HEART score. The HEART score is a risk stratification tool for patients with acute pericarditis. The criteria include: - Hypertension (H) - Electrolyte imbalance (E) - Age ≥ 60 years (A) - Renal dysfunction (R) - Troponin elevation (T) - Body mass index (B) ≥ 35 kg/m^2 - Previous myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (C) - Renal failure (RF) - Age ≥ 60 years (A) Step 3: Evaluate the patient's condition against the HEART score criteria. - Hypertension (H): The patient has a history of hypertension, so this criterion is met. - Electrolyte imbalance (E): The patient has a history of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which can cause electrolyte imbalances, so this criterion is met. - Age ≥ 60 years (A): The patient is 47 years old, so this criterion is not met. - Renal dysfunction (R): The patient has a hemoglobin A1c of 8%, which indicates poor glycemic control, but there is no direct evidence of renal failure, so this criterion is not met. - Troponin elevation (T): The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial damage, so this criterion is met. - Body mass index (B) ≥ 35 kg/m^2: The patient's BMI is not provided, so this criterion cannot be evaluated. - Previous myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (C): The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, which increases the risk of coronary artery disease, so this criterion is met. - Renal failure (RF): The patient does not have evidence of renal failure, so this criterion is not met. - Age ≥ 60 years (A): The patient is 47 years old, so this criterion is not met.

The components are: History (H), ECG (E), Age (A), Risk factors (R), Troponin (T). Each component is scored as low, medium, or high. The patient's presentation: History: The chest pain is pleuritic, which is more typical of pericarditis, so low risk for ACS. ECG: Low voltage in limb leads (seen in pericardial effusion), no ST changes, so ECG might be low risk. Age: 47, so low risk. Risk factors: DM, HTN, so high risk. Troponin: Elevated initially but downtrended, so medium risk. Summing the risk levels: H (low), E (low), A (low), R (high), T (medium). The total HEART score would be calculated by adding the points for each category. However, the exact scoring requires knowing the points for each level. The HEART score assigns points: Low=1, Medium=2, High=3 for each component. The total ranges from 5 (all low) to 15 (all high). Here: H=1 (low), E=1 (low), A=1 (low), R=3 (high), T=2 (medium).

His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ).

Step 4: Convert the result to the required format (weeks and days). </think> Okay, let's start by figuring out the dates. The last menstrual period (LMP) is 10/01/2022, and today's date is 06/13/2023. I need to calculate the time between these two dates. First, I'll convert both dates into days since a common start point. Let me count the days from October 1, 2022, to June 13, 2023. Starting with 2022: October has 31 days. Since the LMP is on the 1st, the remaining days in October are 30 days (since October 1 is day 1, so 31-1=30 days left). November has 30 days, December has 31. So from October 1 to December 31, 2022, that's 30 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) + 31 (Dec) = 91 days. Now for 2023: January has 31, February 28 (since 2023 isn't a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, and up to June 13. Let's add those: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 13 (June) = 164 days. Total days from LMP to June 13, 2023: 91 + 164 = 255 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, actually, the total days between the two dates would be from October 1, 2022, to June 13, 2023. Let me use another method to confirm. Alternatively, using a date calculator approach. Let's count each month step by step: From October 1, 2022, to October 1, 2023, is exactly one year, which is 365 days. But since we're stopping at June 13, 2023, that's 8 months and 12 days less than a full year. Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a month-by-month count. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me recount: From October 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022: October: 31 days total, so from Oct 1 to Oct 31 is 31 days. But since the LMP is on the 1st, the days from Oct 1 to Dec 31 would be 31 (Oct) -1 (since starting on the 1st) + 30 (Nov) + 31 (Dec) = 30 +30+31 = 91 days. That part is correct. Then 2023: January: 31 days February: 28 (2023 is not a leap year) March: 31 April: 30 May: 31 June: 13 days (since we're stopping on June 13) Adding those: 31 +28 +31 +30 +31 +13 = let's see: 31+28 =59; 59+31=90; 90+30=120; 120+31=151; 151+13=164. So total days in 2023 up to June 13 is 164 days. Total days from LMP to today: 91 (2022) + 164 (2023) = 255 days. Now, gestational age is calculated as the number of weeks and days since LMP. 255 days divided by 7 days per week: 255 ÷7 = 36 weeks with a remainder. 36*7=252, so 255-252=3 days. So that would be 36 weeks and 3 days. Wait, but let me confirm the date difference again. Maybe using another approach. Let's use an online calculator method. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the exact number of days between 10/1/2022 and 6/13/2023. Let me count the months: From October 2022 to June 2023 is 9 months (Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, June). But months have varying days. Alternatively, perhaps using a step-by-step count: October 1, 2022 to October 1, 2023 is exactly 365 days. But since we're stopping at June 13, 2023, which is 5 months and 12 days before October 1, 2023. Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me try another way. Let me use the formula: Total days = (end date - start date). Using a date difference calculator (even though I'm doing it manually): Start: 2022-10-01 End: 2023-06-13 Calculating the difference: From 2022-10-01 to 2023-10-01 is 365 days. Subtract the days from 2023-06-13 to 2023-10-01. Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's count each month's days: October 2022: 31 days. Since starting on the 1st, the days remaining in October are 30 days (since day 1 is counted as the start). Wait, actually, when calculating the difference between two dates, the starting day is included. So from October 1 to October 1 is 0 days. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the difference as: June 13, 2023 minus October 1, 2022. Let me break it down: From October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023: that's exactly 365 days (since 2023 is not a leap year). Then add the days from October 1, 2023, to June 13, 2023? Wait, no, that's going forward. Maybe this is getting too tangled. Alternatively, let me use a step-by-step month count: Starting from October 1, 2022: - October has 31 days. So from Oct 1 to Oct 31: 31 days. - November: 30 days (total so far: 61) - December: 31 (total 92) - January 2023: 31 (123) - February: 28 (151) - March: 31 (182) - April: 30 (212) - May: 31 (243) - June 1 to June 13: 13 days (total 243 +13 = 256?) Wait, hold on. Wait, let's recount: Starting from October 1, 2022: October: 31 days (Oct 1 to Oct 31) → 31 days November: 30 → total 61 December: 31 → 92 January 2023: 31 → 123 February: 28 → 151 March: 31 → 182 April: 30 → 212 May: 31 → 243 June: up to June 13 → 13 days. So adding 13 to 243 gives 256 days total. Wait, but that contradicts the previous total of 255. Hmm. Where is the discrepancy? Wait, perhaps in the first calculation, I considered the days from October 1 to December 31 as 91 days. Let's check that again: October 1 to Dec 31, 2022: October has 31 days. From Oct 1 to Oct 31 is 31 days. But if we're starting on Oct 1, then the days from Oct 1 to Dec 31 would be: October: 31 days (including the 1st) November: 30 December: 31 Total: 31 +30 +31 = 92 days. Wait, so that's 92 days, not 91. So my first calculation was wrong here. Ah, here's the mistake. Earlier I subtracted 1 from October's days, but actually, since the LMP is on the 1st, the entire month's days are counted. So October contributes 31 days, not 30. So correcting that: From October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022: 31 (Oct) +30 (Nov) +31 (Dec) = 92 days. Then in 2023: January:31, Feb:28, March:31, April:30, May:31, June 1-13:13. Adding those: 31+28=59; +31=90; +30=120; +31=151; +13=164. Total days: 92 +164 = 256 days. So that's 256 days. Then 256 divided by 7: 256 ÷7 = 36 weeks with remainder 4 days (since 36*7=252; 256-252=4). Wait, so that would be 36 weeks and 4 days. Wait, but in the step-by-step month count earlier, when adding up each month's days, I got 256 days. So that's the correct total. Therefore, the gestational age is 36 weeks and 4 days. Wait, but let me confirm again with another method. Let's use an online date calculator approach. Calculating the difference between 10/1/2022 and 6/13/2023: Using an online calculator (pretending to do it manually): October 1, 2022 to June 13, 2023: Let me count the months: From October to June is 9 months. But let's see: October 1 to November 1: +1 month November 1 to December 1: +1 → 2 December 1 to Jan 1: 3 Jan 1 to Feb 1:4 Feb 1 to March 1:5 March 1 to April 1:6 April 1 to May 1:7 May 1 to June 1:8 June 1 to June 13: 12 days. So 8 months and 12 days. But each month has different days. To get the exact days, perhaps better to use the day count. Alternatively, using the formula: Total days = (end year - start year)*365 + leap days + days in each month. But maybe it's better to stick with the previous calculation. Wait, the first method had an error in October's days. The correct total is 256 days. 256 divided by 7 is 36 weeks and 4 days. So the answer should be (36 weeks, 4 days). Wait, but let me check again with the step-by-step month addition: Starting from October 1, 2022: October: 31 days (Oct 1-31) November: 30 → total 61 December:31 → 92 January 2023:31 → 123 February:28 → 151 March:31 → 182 April:30 → 212 May:31 → 243 June 1-13:13 → 256. Yes, that's correct. So 256 days. 256 /7 = 36.571 weeks. 36 weeks *7 = 252 days. 256-252=4 days. Thus, 36 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (36 weeks, 4 days). Wait, but in my first calculation I had 255 days, but corrected to 256. So the final answer is 36 weeks and 4 days. I think that's the correct result. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, we first determine the number of days between the last menstrual period (10/01/2022) and today's date (06/13/2023).
