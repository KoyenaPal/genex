But first, we need the RR interval. Since the heart rate is 136 bpm, we can find the RR interval from the heart rate.\\n\\nStep 2: Convert the heart rate (136 bpm) to the RR interval. The formula to convert heart rate to RR interval is RR = 60 / heart rate (since the RR interval is the time between successive heartbe ats in seconds). So, RR = 60 / 136 ≈ 0.4412 seconds. Step 3: Now we use Bazett\\'s formula to find the QTc. The given QT interval is 330 msec. Pl ugging into the formula: QTc = 330 / sqrt( 0.4412). Step 4: Calculate the square root of the RR interval, which is sqrt(0.4412) ≈ 0. 6643. Step 5: Divide the QT interval by this square root to get the corrected QT (QTc): QTc = 330 / 0.6643 ≈ 496.44 msec.</think> \\n\\nSo the corrected']\n"

The user wants me to calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett Formula. The given data is a heart rate of 136 bpm and a QT interval of 330 msec.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall …assistantanalysisWe need to compute QTc using Baz ett\\'s formula, which is QTc = QT interval / sqrt(RR interval). But wait, the RR interval is in seconds, right? The heart rate is 136 bpm, so RR = 60 / HR = 60/136 ≈ 0.4411765 s. Then sqrt(RR) ~ sqrt(0.4412) => about 0.664. Then QTc = 330 ms / 0 .664 ≈ 497 ms. So about 497 ms. Let\\'s check: 330/0.664 = 497. If we convert ms, keep ms. So answer 497. Actually rounding maybe 497 . Wait, but sometimes they use 60/HR exactly. That would be 60/136 = 0.4411764706 s. sqrt = 0.664? Let\\'s compute precisely: sqrt( 0.44117647)=0.664. 330/0. 664 = 496.7 ms. So round to 497 ms. So the answer should be 497 msec.\\n</think>\\n\\n{']\n"
