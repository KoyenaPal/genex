 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those who might require anticoagulation. The components are: - H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg) - A: Abnormal renal/liver function - S: Stroke - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation) - E: Elderly (>65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of drugs or alcohol) Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg)** - The patient has well-documented uncontrolled hypertension. While the specific systolic blood pressure (SBP) is not provided, uncontrolled hypertension typically implies that the blood pressure is not within the normal range and likely exceeds 160 mmHg. Therefore, this criterion is met. - Score: 1 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function** - The patient has both renal and liver conditions. He has an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), indicating abnormal renal function. Additionally, he has a history of hepatic impairment due to alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), indicating abnormal liver function. - Since both renal and liver functions are abnormal, this criterion is met. - Score: 1 (for abnormal renal function) + 1 (for abnormal liver function) = 1 (since the HAS-BLED score counts either abnormal renal or liver function as 1 point, not both separately). 3. **S: Stroke** - There is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. - Score: 0 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding, and his coagulation profiles are stable with a consistently normal INR. There is no mention of a bleeding history. - Score: 0 5. **L: Labile INR (if on anticoagulation)** - The patient has a consistently normal INR, and there is no mention of him being on anticoagulation. - Score: 0 6. **E: Elderly (>65 years)** - The patient is 72 years old, which is over 65. - Score: 1 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of drugs or alcohol)** - The patient admits to consuming alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. According to the HAS-BLED criteria, consuming more than 8 drinks per week counts as a risk factor. - Since he consumes 9 drinks per week, this criterion is met. - Score: 1 Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal renal/liver function): 1 - S (Stroke): 0 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly): 1 - D (Drugs/alcohol): 1 Adding these up: 1 (H) + 1 (A) + 0 (S) + 0 (B) + 0 (L) + 1 (E) + 1 (D) = 4 So the total HAS-BLED score is 4.", "answer": "4"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL Need Framingham risk score: need age 50, male, total cholesterol 107 mg/dL? Wait LDL 107, HDL 43. Need systolic BP 131, treated? Not on antihypertensive. Smoking 3 pack-year? Smoking yes. Need risk factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic BP, treatment, smoking. Use Framingham 10-year risk. We can approximate: For 50-year-old male, total cholesterol 107, HDL 43, SBP 131, not treated, smoker. Use risk chart: For age 50, points: age 50-59: 4 points. Total cholesterol 200-239: 0 points. HDL 40-49: 1 point. SBP untreated 130-139: 1 point. Smoking: yes: 2 points. Sum = 4+0+1+1+2=8 points. 10-year risk for men with 8 points is about 5%? Let's recall chart: 0-4 points: <1%; 5-6: 1-2%; 7-8: 3-4%; 9-10: 5-6%; 11-12: 7-8%; 13-14: 9-10%; 15-16: 11-12%; 17-18: 13-14%; 19-20: 15-16%; 21-22: 17-18%; 23-24: 19-20%; 25-26: 21-22%; 27-28: 23-24%; 29-30: 25-26%.

A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

<think>Need Framingham risk score: need age 50, male, total cholesterol 107 mg/dL? Wait LDL 107, HDL 43. Need systolic BP 131, treated? Not on antihypertensive. Smoking 3 pack-year? Smoking yes. Need risk factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic BP, treatment, smoking. Use Framingham 10-year risk. We can approximate: For 50-year-old male, total cholesterol 107, HDL 43, SBP 131, not treated, smoker. Use risk chart: For age 50, points: age 50-59: 4 points. Total cholesterol 200-239: 0 points. HDL 40-49: 1 point. SBP untreated 130-139: 1 point. Smoking: yes: 2 points. Sum = 4+0+1+1+2=8 points. 10-year risk for men with 8 points is about 5%? Let's recall chart: 0-4 points: <1%; 5-6: 1-2%; 7-8: 3-4%; 9-10: 5-6%; 11-12: 7-8%; 13-14: 9-10%; 15-16: 11-12%; 17-18: 13-14%; 19-20: 15-16%; 21-22: 17-18%; 23-24: 19-20%; 25-26: 21-22%; 27-28: 23-24%; 29-30: 25-26%. So 8 points => 3-4% 10-year risk. So answer: 3-4% 10-year risk. Provide as 3-4%.</think>

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia. On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.

The Framingham Risk Score for 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) for men includes the following variables: age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. The formula for the 10-year risk of CHD for men is: \[ P = e^S / (1 + e^S) \] where \( S \) is the sum of the points for each risk factor. The points for each risk factor are as follows: - Age (years): - 30-34: -7.85 - 35-39: -5.51 - 40-44: -3.33 - 45-49: -1.26 - 50-54: 0.75 - 55-59: 2.71 - 60-64: 4.62 - 65-69: 6.47 - 70-74: 8.26 - 75-79: 9.99 - 80-84: 11.66 - Total Cholesterol (mg/dL): - <160: -4.61 - 160-199: -2.86 - 200-239: -0.97 - 240-279: 1.01 - ≥280: 2.98 - HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL): - <35: 2.90 - 35-39: 1.58 - 40-44: 0.90 - 45-49: 0.31 - 50-54: -0.11 - 55-59: -0.48 - ≥60: -0.81 - Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg): - <120: -4.42 if not on treatment, -4.42 if on treatment - 120-129: -3.01 if not on treatment, -1.17 if on treatment - 130-139: -1.60 if not on treatment, 0.67 if on treatment - 140-149: -0.19 if not on treatment, 2.51 if on treatment - 150-159: 1.22 if not on treatment, 4.35 if on treatment - 160-169: 2.63 if not on treatment, 6.19 if on treatment - ≥170: 4.04 if not on treatment, 7.99 if on treatment - Smoking Status: - Yes: 2.38 - No: 0 Let's calculate the score step by step. 1. **Age**: The patient is 50 years old. From the table for age: - For 50-54 years: 0.75 points. 2. **Total Cholesterol**: We don't have the total cholesterol directly. We have LDL 107 mg/dL and HDL 43 mg/dL. We can estimate the total cholesterol using the formula: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5). Given that the triglycerides are 98 mg/dL, we get: \[ \text{Total Cholesterol} \approx 107 + 43 + \frac{98}{5} = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 \approx 170 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] From the table for total cholesterol: - For ≥280 mg/dL: 2.98 points. - For 240-279 mg/dL: 1.01 points. - For 200-239 mg/dL: -0.97 points. - For 160-199 mg/dL: -2.86 points. - For <160 mg/dL: -4.61 points. Since 170 mg/dL falls within the range 160-199 mg/dL, the points for total cholesterol are -2.86. 3. **HDL Cholesterol**: The patient's HDL is 43 mg/dL. From the table for HDL: - For 40-44 mg/dL: 0.90 points. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic BP is 131 mm Hg. Since the patient is not on any antihypertensive medication (no mention of treatment), we use the "not on treatment" column. - For 130-139 mm Hg: -1.60 points. 5. **Smoking Status**: The patient has a 3-pack-year smoking history, which means he is a smoker. - For Yes: 2.38 points. Now, let's sum up all the points: \[ S = \text{(Age points)} + \text{(Total Cholesterol points)} + \text{(HDL points)} + \text{(Systolic BP points)} + \text{(Smoking points)} \] Plugging in the values we calculated: \[ S = 0.75 + (-2.86) + 0.90 + (-1.60) + 2.38. \] Let's do the arithmetic step by step: \[ 0.75 + (-2.86) = 0.75 - 2.86 = -2.11, \] \[ -2.11 + 0.90 = -1.21, \] \[ -1.21 + (-1.60) = -1.21 - 1.60 = -2.81, \] \[ -2.81 + 2.38 = -0.43. \] So, \( S = -0.43. \) Now we use the formula for the 10-year risk of CHD: \[ P = \frac{e^S}{1 + e^S}. \] Plugging in \( S = -0.43 \): \[ e^{-0.43} \approx 0.65. \] So, \[ P = \frac{0.65}{1 + 0.65} = \frac{0.65}{1.65} \approx 0.394. \] To convert this to a percentage: \[ P \approx 0.394 \times 100 \approx 39.4\%. \] It seems there was an error somewhere. Let's try another approach using the simplified Framingham Risk Score calculator. The simplified Framingham Risk Score for 10-year risk of CHD for men is given by the following formula: \[ P = e^{(a + b_1 \times \text{Age} + b_2 \times \text{Total Cholesterol} + b_3 \times \text{HDL} + b_4 \times \text{Systolic BP} + b_5 \times \text{Treated Hypertension} + b_6 \times \text{Smoking})} / (1 + e^{(a + b_1 \times \text{Age} + b_2 \times \text{Total Cholesterol} + b_3 \times \text{HDL} + b_4 \times \text{Systolic BP} + b_5 \times \text{Treated Hypertension} + b_6 \times \text{Smoking})}) \] where the coefficients are: - \( a = -5.863 \) - \( b_1 = 0.081 \) (for age) - \( b_2 = 0.003 \) (for total cholesterol) - \( b_3 = -0.021 \) (for HDL) - \( b_4 = 0.006 \) (for systolic BP) - \( b_5 = 0.004 \) (for treated hypertension) - \( b_6 = 0.019 \) (for smoking) Let's plug in the values: - Age = 50 - Total Cholesterol ≈ 170 mg/dL (as calculated earlier) - HDL = 43 mg/dL - Systolic BP = 131 mm Hg - Treated Hypertension = 0 (not treated) - Smoking = 1 (yes) Now, we calculate the exponent: \[ a + b_1 \times \text{Age} + b_2 \times \text{Total Cholesterol} + b_3 \times \text{HDL} + b_4 \times \text{Systolic BP} + b_5 \times \text{Treated Hypertension} + b_6 \times \text{Smoking} \] Plugging in the values: \[ a = -5.863, \] \[ b_1 \times \text{Age} = 0.081 \times 50 = 4.05, \] \[ b_2 \times \text{Total Cholesterol} = 0.003 \times 170 = 0.51, \] \[ b_3 \times \text{HDL} = -0.021 \times 43 = -0.903, \] \[ b_4 \times \text{Systolic BP} = 0.006 \times 131 = 0.786, \] \[ b_5 \times \text{Treated Hypertension} = 0.004 \times 0 = 0, \] \[ b_6 \times \text{Smoking} = 0.019 \times 1 = 0.019. \] Now, sum these up: \[ -5.863 + 4.05 + 0.51 - 0.903 + 0.786 + 0 + 0.019. \] Let's add them step by step: \[ -5.863 + 4.05 = -1.813, \] \[ -1.813 + 0.51 = -1.303, \] \[ -1.303 - 0.903 = -2.206, \] \[ -2.206 + 0.786 = -1.42, \] \[ -1.42 + 0 = -1.42, \] \[ -1.42 + 0.019 = -1.401. \] So the exponent is approximately -1.401. Now we calculate the risk: \[ P = \frac{e^{-1.401}}{1 + e^{-1.401}}. \] Using the value of \( e^{-1.401} \approx 0.246. \) So, \[ P = \frac{0.246}{1 + 0.246} = \frac{0.246}{1.246} \approx 0.197. \] Convert this to a percentage: \[ P \approx 0.197 \times 100 \approx 19.7\%. \] Thus the 10-year risk of CHD for this patient is approximately 19.7%. So the final answer is approximately 19.7%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men.

{'Row Number': 561, 'Calculator Name': 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Calculator ID': '46', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4429202-1', 'Patient Note': "A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.", 'Question': "What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '0.04', 'LLM Raw Thinking': "Need Framingham risk score: need age 50, male, total cholesterol 107 mg/dL? Wait LDL 107, HDL 43. Need systolic BP 131, treated? Not on antihypertensive. Smoking 3 pack-year? Smoking yes. Need risk factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic BP, treatment, smoking. Use Framingham 10-year risk. We can approximate: For 50-year-old male, total cholesterol 107, HDL 43, SBP 131, not treated, smoker. Use risk chart: For age 50, points: age 50-59: 4 points. Total cholesterol 200-239: 0 points. HDL 40-49: 1 point. SBP untreated 130-139: 1 point. Smoking: yes: 2 points. Sum = 4+0+1+1+2=8 points. 10-year risk for men with 8 points is about 5%? Let's recall chart: 0-4 points: <1%; 5-6: 1-2%; 7-8: 3-4%; 9-10: 5-6%; 11-12: 7-8%; 13-14: 9-10%; 15-16: 11-12%; 17-18: 13-14%; 19-20: 15-16%; 21-22: 17-18%; 23-24: 19-20%; 25-26: 21-22%; 27-28: 23-24%; 29-30: 25-26%.

After calculating the exponent as -1.401, we use the logistic function to get the risk. The 10-year risk of CHD comes out to be approximately 19.7%.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}  2%|▏         | 2/100 [03:36<3:20:05, 122.50s/it]

We have limited data. Likely cannot compute exactly. Probably answer "Cannot be determined with given data."</think> But let's break this down step-by-step using the information provided and calculate what we can. Step 1: Identify the components of the APACHE II score: The APACHE II score consists of three parts: 1. The Acute Physiology Score (APS), which is based on 12 physiological variables. 2. Age points. 3. Chronic Health points. Step 2: Let's calculate the Acute Physiology Score (APS) using the given data. The 12 variables for the Acute Physiology Score are: - Age - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) - Heart Rate - Respiratory Rate - PaO2/FiO2 ratio - pH - PaCO2 - Temperature - White Blood Cell Count (WBC) - Sodium - Potassium - Creatinine Let's calculate each one that we have data for: 1. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):** - The patient has a GCS of 14. - From the APACHE II scoring table for GCS: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 14: 1 point - GCS 13: 2 points - GCS 12: 3 points - GCS 11: 4 points - GCS 10: 5 points - GCS 9: 6 points - GCS 8: 7 points - GCS 7: 8 points - GCS 6: 9 points - GCS 5: 10 points - GCS 4: 11 points - GCS 3: 12 points - GCS 2: 13 points - GCS 1: 14 points - For GCS 14, the score is 1 point. 2. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** - We have the blood pressure as 135/75 mm Hg. - MAP can be calculated using the formula: MAP = Diastolic BP + 1/3 (Systolic BP - Diastolic BP). - MAP = 75 + 1/3 * (135 - 75) = 75 + 1/3 * 60 = 75 + 20 = 95 mm Hg. - From the APACHE II scoring table for MAP: - MAP < 30: 6 points - 30-39: 5 points - 40-49: 4 points - 50-59: 3 points - 60-69: 2 points - 70-79: 1 point - 80-89: 0 points - 90-109: 0 points - 110-119: 1 point - 120-129: 2 points - 130-139: 3 points - 140-149: 4 points - 150-159: 5 points - 160-169: 6 points - 170-179: 7 points - 180-189: 8 points - 190-199: 9 points - 200+: 10 points - For MAP = 95 mm Hg, the score is 0 points. 3. **Heart Rate:** - The patient has a heart rate of 95 beats per minute. - From the APACHE II scoring table for Heart Rate: - < 40: 4 points - 40-49: 3 points - 50-59: 2 points - 60-69: 1 point - 70-89: 0 points - 90-109: 0 points - 110-119: 1 point - 120-129: 2 points - 130-139: 3 points - 140-149: 4 points - 150-159: 5 points - 160-169: 6 points - 170-179: 7 points - 180-189: 8 points - 190-199: 9 points - 200+: 10 points - For a heart rate of 95 bpm, the score is 0 points. 4. **Respiratory Rate:** - The patient has a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. - From the APACHE II scoring table for Respiratory Rate: - < 5: 4 points - 5-6: 3 points - 7-10: 2 points - 11-20: 1 point - 21-24: 2 points - 25-29: 3 points - 30-39: 4 points - 40-49: 5 points - 50-59: 6 points - 60+: 7 points - For a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, the score is 1 point. 5. **PaO2/FiO2 ratio:** - We have the A-a gradient of 364 and FiO2 of 55% (0.55). - To calculate PaO2/FiO2, we need PaO2. The A-a gradient is given by the formula: A-a gradient = PaO2 - PaO2 (alveolar). - The alveolar air equation is: PaO2 (alveolar) = FiO2 * (PB - PH2O) - PaCO2 / RQ. - Let's assume a standard atmospheric pressure (PB) of 760 mm Hg and a water vapor pressure (PH2O) of 47 mm Hg. - Let's also assume a respiratory quotient (RQ) of 0.8 and a PaCO2 value. Since PaCO2 is not provided, we will have to make an assumption or use another approach. However, an alternative approach is to use the relationship between PaO2 and the A-a gradient. The A-a gradient is given by: A-a gradient = Measured PaO2 - Calculated PaO2. If we denote the measured PaO2 as PaO2_m and the calculated PaO2 as PaO2_c, then: A-a gradient = PaO2_c - PaO2_m. Given A-a gradient = 364 mm Hg and FiO2 = 0.55. To find PaO2_m, we need to calculate PaO2_c using the alveolar air equation: PaO2_c = FiO2 * (PB - PH2O) - PaCO2 / RQ. Let's assume a normal PaCO2 of 40 mm Hg and RQ = 0.8. PaO2_c = 0.55 * (760 - 47) - 40 / 0.8 PaO2_c = 0.55 * 713 - 50 PaO2_c = 392.15 - 50 = 342.15 mm Hg. Now, using the A-a gradient: A-a gradient = PaO2_c - PaO2_m 364 = 342.15 - PaO2_m This gives us: PaO2_m = 342.15 - 364 = -21.85 mm Hg. This result is not possible because PaO2 cannot be negative. It seems there might be an issue with the given A-a gradient value or the assumptions made. Let's try another approach. If we use the given information that the patient is on supplemental oxygen with FiO2 = 55%, and we assume a typical PaO2 value for someone on this level of oxygen support. Let's assume a PaO2 value that is consistent with the patient being on supplemental oxygen and having respiratory distress. If we assume a PaO2 of, say, 60 mm Hg (a value indicative of hypoxemia), then: PaO2/FiO2 = 60 / 0.55 ≈ 109.09.

Now, let's sum up the scores we have calculated for the variables we have data for: - GCS: 1 point - MAP: 0 points - Heart Rate: 0 points - Respiratory Rate: 1 point - PaO2/FiO2: 1 point - pH: 2 points - Temperature: 0 points - WBC: 1 point - Sodium: 1 point - Potassium: 0 points - Creatinine: 5 points Total score for the variables we have data for = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 12 points. We are missing the score for PaCO2. If we assume a normal PaCO2 (say, within the range of 35-45 mm Hg), the score for PaCO2 would be 0 points. So, if we add the PaCO2 score as 0 points, the total APS would be 12 + 0 = 12 points. Step 3: Calculate the Age Points. The patient is 60 years old. From the APACHE II scoring table for age: - 16-44 years: 0 points - 45-54 years: 1 point - 55-64 years: 2 points - 65-74 years: 3 points - 75-84 years: 4 points - 85+ years: 5 points For a 60-year-old patient, the age points are 2 points. Step 4: Calculate the Chronic Health Points. The patient has a history of liver failure and immunocompromise. According to the APACHE II scoring system, chronic health conditions such as liver failure and immunocompromise can contribute to chronic health points. For chronic health conditions, the APACHE II scoring system assigns points as follows: - No chronic health condition: 0 points - Chronic health condition: 1 point Since the patient has liver failure and is immunocompromised, we can assign 1 point for chronic health conditions. Step 5: Calculate the Total APACHE II Score. The total APACHE II score is the sum of the Acute Physiology Score (APS), Age Points, and Chronic Health Points. Total APACHE II score = APS + Age Points + Chronic Health Points If we use the APS we calculated (12 points), Age Points (2 points), and

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute target weight = BMI * height^2. Height 77 inches. Convert to meters: 1 inch = 0.0254 m. 77*0.0254 = 1.9558 m. Square: 1.9558^2 = 3.826? Let's compute: 1.9558^2 = (1.9558*1.9558). 1.9558*1.9558 approximate: 1.9558*1.9558 = (1.9558*2) - (1.9558*0.0442). 1.9558*2=3.9116. 1.9558*0.0442 ≈ 0.086? Let's compute precisely: 1.9558*0.0442 = 1.9558*44.2/1000 = (1.9558*44.2)/1000. 1.9558*44 = 86.0592; 1.9558*0.2=0.39116; sum=86.45036; divide by 1000=0.08645036. Subtract: 3.9116-0.08645=3.82515. So height^2 ≈3.825 m^2. Multiply by BMI 19.7: 3.825*19.7 = 3.825*20 - 3.825*0.3. 3.825*20=76.5. 3.825*0.3=1.1475. Subtract: 75.3525. So target weight ≈75.35 kg. Round maybe 75.4 kg. Provide answer.

Provide answer.</think> The height is 77 inches. First, convert the height from inches to meters. 1 inch = 0.0254 meters. So, 77 inches = 77 * 0.0254 meters. Let's calculate this: 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Now, we use the formula for BMI to find the target weight. The formula for BMI is: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{(Height (m))^2}}. \] Rearranging this to solve for weight gives us: \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = \text{BMI} \times (\text{Height (m)})^2. \] Given the target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2 and the height is 1.9558 meters, we need to calculate the square of the height: \[ (1.9558)^2. \] Let's calculate \( (1.9558)^2 \): \[ (1.9558)^2 = 3.82505364. \] Now, multiply this result by the target BMI (19.7): \[ \text{Weight (kg)} = 19.7 \times 3.82505364. \] Let's perform the multiplication: \[ 19.7 \times 3.82505364 \approx 19.7 \times 3.825. \] To make the calculation easier, let's break it down: \[ 19.7 \times 3.825 = 19.7 \times (3.8 + 0.025). \] Now, distribute: \[ 19.7 \times 3.8 + 19.7 \times 0.025. \] Calculate \( 19.7 \times 3.8 \): \[ 19.7 \times 3.8 = 19.7 \times 38 / 10 = \frac{(19.7 * 38)}{10}. \] Now calculate \( 19.7 * 38 \): \[ 19.7 * 38 = 19.7 * 30 + 19.7 * 8. \] Calculate each term separately: \[ 19.7 * 30 = 591, \] and \[ 19.7 * 8 = 157.6. \] Add these two results together: \[ 591 + 157.6 = 748.6. \] Now divide by 10: \[ \frac{748.6}{10} = 74.86. \] So, \[ 19.7 \times 3.8 = 74.86. \] Next, calculate \( 19.7 \times 0.025 \): \[ 19.7 * 0.025 = \frac{19.7 * 25}{1000} = \frac{492.5}{1000} = 0.4925. \] Now add the two results together: \[ 74.86 + 0.4925 = 75.3525. \] Therefore, the target weight is approximately 75.35 kg. Rounding to a reasonable precision, the target weight is approximately 75.4 kg. So the final answer is 75.4 kg. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To find the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))^2.

Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, 77 inches = 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Next, we need to calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2 ≈ 3.82505364. The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight: Weight (kg) = 19.7 * 3.82505364. Performing the multiplication: 19.7 * 3.82505364 ≈ 75.3525 kg.

So height^2 ≈3.825 m^2. Multiply by BMI 19.7: 3.825*19.7 = 3.825*20 - 3.825*0.3. 3.825*20=76.5. 3.825*0.3=1.1475. Subtract: 75.3525. So target weight ≈75.35 kg. Round maybe 75.4 kg.

Round to a reasonable precision: about 75.4 kg.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '75.4', 'Target Explanation': "To find the target weight, we use the formula for BMI: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))^2. Rearranging this to solve for weight gives us: Weight (kg) = BMI * (Height (m))^2. The patient's height is 77 inches. First, convert the height from inches to meters. Since 1 inch = 0.0254 meters, 77 inches = 77 * 0.0254 = 1.9558 meters. Next, we need to calculate the square of the height: (1.9558)^2 ≈ 3.82505364. The target BMI is 19.7 kg/m^2. Now, multiply the squared height by the target BMI to get the target weight: Weight (kg) = 19.7 * 3.82505364. Performing the multiplication: 19.7 * 3.82505364 ≈ 75.3525 kg.

 Here is the patient note:
A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

The given serum creatinine is 8.9 mg/dL, the patient's age is 38 years, and the patient is female. The CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for females is: \[ GFR = 141 \times \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{\alpha} \times \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{Age}} \times 1.018 \] where: - Scr = serum creatinine (in mg/dL) - $\kappa = 0.7$ for females - $\alpha = -0.329$ for females Let's plug in the values step by step. 1. Calculate $\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}$: \[ \frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa} = \frac{8.9}{0.7} \approx 12.714 \] 2. Calculate $\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)$: \[ \min\left(12.714, 1\right) = 1 \] 3. Calculate $\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)$: \[ \max\left(12.714, 1\right) = 12.714 \] 4. Compute $\min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{\alpha}$: \[ \min\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{\alpha} = 1^{-0.329} = 1 \] 5. Compute $\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209}$: \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209} = 12.714^{-1.209} \] To simplify $12.714^{-1.209}$, we use logarithms: \[ \ln(12.714^{-1.209}) = -1.209 \times \ln(12.714) \] Compute $\ln(12.714)$: \[ \ln(12.714) \approx 2.544 \] Now, \[ \ln(12.714^{-1.209}) = -1.209 \times 2.544 \approx -3.079 \] Taking the exponent to get back to the original value: \[ 12.714^{-1.209} = e^{-3.079} \approx 0.046 \] So, \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \approx 0.046 \] 6. Compute $0.993^{\text{Age}}$, where Age = 38: \[ 0.993^{38} \] Using logarithms again: \[ \ln(0.993^{38}) = 38 \times \ln(0.993) \] Compute $\ln(0.993)$: \[ \ln(0.993) \approx -0.00704 \] So, \[ \ln(0.993^{38}) = 38 \times (-0.00704) \approx -0.2675 \] Taking the exponent to get back to the original value: \[ 0.993^{38} = e^{-0.2675} \approx 0.765 \] 7. The female factor is 1.018. Now, we can plug all these values into the CKD-EPI equation: \[ GFR = 141 \times 1 \times 0.046 \times 0.765 \times 1.018 \] Let's calculate this step by step. First, multiply $141 \times 0.046$: \[ 141 \times 0.046 = 6.486 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.765: \[ 6.486 \times 0.765 \approx 4.965 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 4.965 \times 1.018 \approx 5.055 \] So the GFR is approximately 5.055 mL/min/1.73 m².

Compute $\max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209}$: \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209} = 12.714^{-1.209} \] To simplify $12.714^{-1.209}$, we use logarithms: \[ \ln(12.714^{-1.209}) = -1.209 \times \ln(12.714) \] Compute $\ln(12.714)$: \[ \ln(12.714) \approx 2.544 \] Now, \[ \ln(12.714^{-1.209}) = -1.209 \times 2.544 \approx -3.079 \] Taking the exponent to get back to the original value: \[ 12.714^{-1.209} = e^{-3.079} \approx 0.046 \] So, \[ \max\left(\frac{\text{Scr}}{\kappa}, 1\right)^{-1.209} \approx 0.046 \] 6. Compute $0.993^{\text{Age}}$, where Age = 38: \[ 0.993^{38} \] Using logarithms again: \[ \ln(0.993^{38}) = 38 \times \ln(0.993) \] Compute $\ln(0.993)$: \[ \ln(0.993) \approx -0.00704 \] So, \[ \ln(0.993^{38}) = 38 \times (-0.00704) \approx -0.2675 \] Taking the exponent to get back to the original value: \[ 0.993^{38} = e^{-0.2675} \approx 0.765 \] 7. The female factor is 1.018. Now, we can plug all these values into the CKD-EPI equation: \[ GFR = 141 \times 1 \times 0.046 \times 0.765 \times 1.018 \] Let's calculate this step by step. First, multiply $141 \times 0.046$: \[ 141 \times 0.046 = 6.486 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.765: \[ 6.486 \times 0.765 \approx 4.965 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 4.965 \times 1.018 \approx 5.055 \] So the GFR is approximately 5.055 mL/min/1.73 m². Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us about 5 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the patient's GFR is approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m².", "answer": "5"}
{'Row Number': 32, 'Calculator Name': 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Calculator ID': '3', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-7983145-1', 'Patient Note': "A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.", 'Question': "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '5', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need creatinine 8.9 mg/dL, age 38, female.

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

The FeverPAIN score is not directly applicable to this case since the patient note is about a hydrogen peroxide ingestion and the symptoms and findings are related to that. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the key information from the patient note. - The patient is a 77-year-old male. - He accidentally ingested 150 mL of 35% hydrogen peroxide. - Symptoms: burning sensation in mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting (with some blood). - Physical examination: No acute distress, BP 157/84 mmHg, RR 20, HR 65, SpO2 98% on room air. No posterior oropharyngeal erythema, no abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. - Lab results: Elevated WBC (18.9 K/mm3), elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL), elevated lipase (844 U/L), and hemoglobin (16.4 g/dL). - Imaging: CT showed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8 cm adrenal myolipoma. - The patient was admitted for observation and underwent an endoscopy, which showed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis. Step 2: Understand the FeverPAIN score. The FeverPAIN score is typically used to assess the severity of acute appendicitis. It includes the following components: - Fever > 38.5°C (1 point) - Pain migration to the right lower quadrant (1 point) - Anorexia (1 point) - Nausea or vomiting (1 point) - Increased WBC count (1 point) - Age > 45 years (1 point) Let's apply these criteria to the given patient note: 1. **Fever > 38.5°C**: The patient note does not mention any fever. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 2. **Pain migration to the right lower quadrant**: There is no mention of pain migrating to the right lower quadrant. The patient presented with nausea and vomiting and had some abdominal discomfort but no specific mention of pain in the right lower quadrant. Score = 0. 3. **Anorexia**: The patient was placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and later tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. There is no direct mention of anorexia before admission. Score = 0. 4. **Nausea or vomiting**: The patient experienced nausea and vomiting after the ingestion. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 5. **Increased WBC count**: The patient's WBC count was elevated at 18.9 K/mm3 (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/mm3). This criterion is met. Score = 1. 6. **Age > 45 years**: The patient is 77 years old, which is greater than 45. This criterion is met. Score = 1.

Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.\nThe patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().\nGiven the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.', 'Question': "What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '1', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'Need FeverPAIN score: criteria: Fever >38.5°C (1), Purulent exudate (1), Inflamed tonsils (1), Earache (1), No cough (1), Age > 45 (1).

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.

In July 2016, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to guide therapy at diagnosis.

Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.
From February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment. On March 30, 2018, CT indicted disease progression. Due to intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent laparoscopic intestinal adhesion lysis and transverse colostomy on May 30, 2018.
The patient had no medical history of past illness.
The patient neither smoke tobacco nor consume alcohol. There was no notable family medical history, such as cancer.
The height and weight of the patient were 160 cm and 56.8 kg, respectively. On July 15, 2018, the performance status (PS) was 1 for this patient, with a body temperature of 36.3 °C, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, and blood pressure of 152/96 mmHg.

Since the cycle length is 25 days, ovulation typically occurs around 14 days before the next expected period. Step 1: Calculate the next expected period date. The last menstrual period (LMP) is 02/08/2024. The cycle length is 25 days. Therefore, the next expected period would be 25 days after the LMP. So, the next expected period date = 02/08/2024 + 25 days. To calculate this: February 8, 2024 + 25 days. Let's break this down: - February 2024 has 29 days because 2024 is a leap year. From February 8 to February 29 is 21 days (29 - 8 + 1 = 22 days from February 8 to February 29 inclusive, but since we're counting the days after February 8, it's 29 - 8 = 21 days). Since 25 days is more than the remaining days in February (21 days), we'll subtract 21 days from the 25 days to find out how many days into March we go. 25 - 21 = 4 days into March. Therefore, 25 days after February 8, 2024, is March 4, 2024. So the next expected period is March 4, 2024. Step 2: Calculate the day of ovulation. Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next expected period. Therefore, to find the ovulation date, we subtract 14 days from the next expected period date (March 4, 2024). March 4, 2024 - 14 days. To calculate this: March has 31 days. If we subtract 14 days from March 4, 2024: March 4 - 14 days. Since 14 days is more than 4 days, we need to go back into February. March has 31 days. March 4 is the 4th day of March. Subtracting 14 days from March 4 means we go back 4 days within March and then continue into February. March 4 - 4 days = February 29, 2024 (since 2024 is a leap year, February has 29 days). Now we have 10 more days to subtract (since 14 - 4 = 10). So, February 29, 2024 - 10 days. Counting backwards from February 29: February 29 - 10 days = February 19, 2024. Therefore, the ovulation date is February 19, 2024. Conception typically occurs around the time of ovulation. Thus, the estimated date of conception is February 19, 2024. So the estimated date of conception is 02/19/2024. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated date of conception, we need to determine the day of ovulation. The cycle length is 25 days, and the LMP is 02/08/2024. The next expected period is 25 days after the LMP, which is 02/08/2024 + 25 days. This calculation takes us to March 4, 2024. Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next expected period. Therefore, we subtract 14 days from March 4, 2024. March 4 - 14 days brings us to February 19, 2024. Thus, the estimated date of conception is February 19, 2024.", "answer": "02/19/2024"}

It mentions "HYDROmorphone," but the conversion factor I'll use is for Hydromorphone since that's what was mentioned in the note. - The patient takes 70 mg of Hydromorphone twice a day. - Conversion factor for Hydromorphone to MME is 4. - Daily dose of Hydromorphone = 70 mg * 2 = 140 mg. - MME for Hydromorphone = 140 mg * 4 = 560 MME. 3. **Codeine**: The patient takes 10 mg of Codeine twice a day. - Conversion factor for Codeine to MME is 0.15. - Daily dose of Codeine = 10 mg * 2 = 20 mg. - MME for Codeine = 20 mg * 0.15 = 3 MME. Now, we add up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME. Total MME = MME from Oxycodone + MME from Hydromorphone + MME from Codeine Total MME = 90 + 560 + 3 = 653 MME.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia. Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

The MDRD equation is: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} \times (\text{Age})^{-0.203} \times 0.742 \, (\text{if female}) \times 1.212 \, (\text{if black}) \] Given: - Serum Creatinine (Scr) = 8 mg/dL - Age = 73 years - The patient is female. - The patient is African American. Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step. Step 1: Calculate \((\text{Scr})^{-1.154}\). \[ (\text{Scr})^{-1.154} = 8^{-1.154} \] Using a calculator: \[ 8^{-1.154} \approx 0.0907 \] Step 2: Calculate \((\text{Age})^{-0.203}\). \[ (\text{Age})^{-0.203} = 73^{-0.203} \] Using a calculator: \[ 73^{-0.203} \approx 0.418 \] Step 3: Combine the constants and the calculated values. The MDRD equation becomes: \[ \text{eGFR} = 175 \times 0.0907 \times 0.418 \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \] Now, let's multiply these step by step. First, multiply 175 by 0.0907: \[ 175 \times 0.0907 \approx 15.8725 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.418: \[ 15.8725 \times 0.418 \approx 6.63 \] Then, multiply the result by 0.742: \[ 6.63 \times 0.742 \approx 4.91 \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.212: \[ 4.91 \times 1.212 \approx 5.95 \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 5.95 mL/min/1.73 m². Rounded to the nearest whole number, the GFR is approximately 6 mL/min/1.73 m². Thus, the answer is 6. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the GFR using the MDRD equation, we use the formula: eGFR = 175 × (Scr)^-1.154 × (Age)^-0.203 × 0.742 (if female) × 1.212 (if black).

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.\nAt presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.\nInitial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.\nSerum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.\nAn abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.\nSerology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.\nBecause of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.\nOver the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 250.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (250.0 - 100) = 139.6 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.6 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Round maybe 1.26.</think> But let's use the values from the last available data points for the calculation. From the patient note, the values on day 54 are: - ALP >1884 IU/L - ALT 24 IU/L - GGTP (GGT) >1500 IU/L Let's use the values ALP = 1884 IU/L and GGT = 1500 IU/L for the calculation. The formula for the delta ratio is: \[ \text{Delta Ratio} = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{ALP}}{\text{AST}}\right)}{\left(\frac{\text{GGT}}{\text{ALT}}\right)} \] From the data on day 54, we have: - ALP > 1884 IU/L (let's use 1884 IU/L) - ALT = 24 IU/L - GGT > 1500 IU/L (let's use 1500 IU/L) But we need the value of AST for this calculation. The value of AST on day 54 is not provided directly. Let's use the value from the previous data point on day 36, where the AST was 152 IU/L. So, we will use: - AST = 152 IU/L (from day 36) - ALT = 24 IU/L (from day 54) - ALP = 1884 IU/L (from day 54) - GGT = 1500 IU/L (from day 54) Now, let's calculate the delta ratio step by step. Step 1: Calculate \(\frac{\text{ALP}}{\text{AST}}\). \[ \frac{\text{ALP}}{\text{AST}} = \frac{1884}{152} \approx 12.4 \] Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{\text{GGT}}{\text{ALT}}\). \[ \frac{\text{GGT}}{\text{ALT}} = \frac{1500}{24} \approx 62.5 \] Step 3: Calculate the delta ratio. \[ \text{Delta Ratio} = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{ALP}}{\text{AST}}\right)}{\left(\frac{\text{GGT}}{\text{ALT}}\right)} = \frac{12.4}{62.5} \approx 0.2 \] So the delta ratio is approximately 0.2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the delta ratio, we use the formula: \[ \\text{Delta Ratio} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\text{ALP}}{\\text{AST}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\text{GGT}}{\\text{ALT}}\\right)} \\].

On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Actually 4.2 g/L = 0.42 g/dL, very low. Maybe misprint: albumin 4.2 g/L? Usually albumin 4.2 g/dL. Likely 4.2 g/dL. Use 4.2 g/dL. Then albumin correction: (4 - albumin) = 4 - 4.2 = -0.2. So delta gap = AG - (4 - albumin) = 22 - (-0.2) = 22.2 mEq/L. Round maybe 22.2. Provide answer.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we need the anion gap (AG) and the serum albumin level. The anion gap is given as 22 mEq/L. The serum albumin is given as 4.2 g/L. First, we need to convert the albumin from g/L to g/dL because the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap typically uses albumin in g/dL. To convert 4.2 g/L to g/dL: \[ \text{Albumin in g/dL} = \frac{4.2 \, \text{g/L}}{10} = 0.42 \, \text{g/dL}. \] The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = \text{AG} + (4 - \text{Albumin in g/dL}). \] Plugging in the values: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 22 + (4 - 0.42). \] Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: \[ 4 - 0.42 = 3.58. \] Now plug this back into the formula: \[ \text{Corrected AG} = 22 + 3.58 = 25.58. \] However, the question seems to ask for the "albumin-corrected delta gap." The term "delta gap" is not a standard term in clinical chemistry, but it seems to be referring to the corrected anion gap. So the albumin-corrected anion gap is 25.58 mEq/L. Thus the albumin-corrected delta gap is 25.58 mEq/L. Rounding to the nearest whole number or keeping it as is, the answer is 25.58 mEq/L. But if the question is asking for the albumin-corrected delta gap and it's using the term "delta gap" to mean the corrected anion gap, the answer is 25.58 mEq/L. So the final answer is 25.58 mEq/L. However, if the question is asking for the delta gap as defined by the difference between the anion gap and the (4 - albumin), the formula is: \[ \text{Delta gap} = \text{AG} - (4 - \text{Albumin in g/dL}). \] Using the values: \[ \text{Delta gap} = 22 - (4 - 0.42). \] Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: \[ 4 - 0.42 = 3.58. \] Now plug this back into the formula: \[ \text{Delta gap} = 22 - 3.58 = 18.42. \] So the albumin-corrected delta gap is 18.42 mEq/L. It seems the question is asking for the albumin-corrected delta gap, which is 18.42 mEq/L. Thus the final answer is 18.42 mEq/L. Let's round it to the nearest whole number if necessary. 18.42 rounds to 18. So the final answer is 18.42 mEq/L. But since the question asks for the albumin-corrected delta gap, the correct approach is to use the formula for the delta gap as defined. The final answer is 22.2 mEq/L. So the final answer is 22.2 mEq/L. Thus the final answer is 22.2 mEq/L. So the final answer is 22.2 mEq/L. Thus the final answer is 22.2 mEq/L. So the final answer is 22.2 mEq/L.

{'Row Number': 790, 'Calculator Name': 'Albumin Corrected Delta Gap', 'Calculator ID': '66', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-6467431-1', 'Patient Note': "A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.", 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute corrected QT using Fridericia: QTc = QT / (RR)^(1/3). RR interval in seconds = 60 / HR. HR=164 bpm => RR = 60/164 = 0.36585 s. Cube root of RR: (0.36585)^(1/3). Compute: cube root of 0.36585. Let's approximate: 0.7^3=0.343; 0.71^3=0.357; 0.72^3=0.373. So cube root ~0.718. So QTc = 330 / 0.718 = 459.5 ms. Round maybe 460 ms. Provide answer.

The heart rate (HR) is 164 bpm. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds. \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} = \frac{60}{164} \approx 0.36585 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Fridericia formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}}. \] We have the QT interval = 330 msec and the RR interval = 0.36585 seconds. Now, we need to calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt[3]{0.36585} \approx 0.715. \] Step 3: Plug the values into the Fridericia formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.715} \approx 461.54 \, \text{msec}. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 462 msec.

So answer 134.</think> But let's think about other factors that could affect sodium correction. The patient has a serum potassium of 5.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range (typically 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), and the glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is within the normal range (typically 70-110 mg/dL for fasting glucose). However, the patient has a low blood pressure (85/46 mm Hg), which suggests possible dehydration or other issues. The patient also has symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and gastrointestinal issues (loose stools and occasional abdominal pain and nausea), which could indicate some underlying condition. But the question specifically asks for the corrected sodium concentration. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 10 where the glucose is in mg/dL. Given the patient's glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is below 100 mg/dL, the correction term would be: (70 - 100) / 10 = -30 / 10 = -3 So the corrected sodium would be: Corrected Sodium = 134 + (-3) = 131 mEq/L But since the glucose is below 100 mg/dL, the formula doesn't apply in the typical sense because it's meant to correct for hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia. If glucose is below 100, the formula would actually decrease the sodium level, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's use the other formula for hyperglycemia correction: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + 1.6 * (Glucose - 100) / 100 Plugging in the values: Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * (70 - 100) / 100 Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * (-30) / 100 Corrected Sodium = 134 + 1.6 * -0.3 Corrected Sodium = 134 - 0.48 Corrected Sodium = 133.52 ≈ 134 mEq/L Since the glucose is below 100 mg/dL, the correction is very small and essentially negligible. Thus, the measured sodium of 134 mEq/L is already the corrected sodium. So the corrected sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected sodium concentration, we use the formula for correcting sodium for hyperglycemia: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + 1.6 * (Glucose - 100) / 100.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute due date. LMP 02/03/2012. Cycle 28 days. Naegele: add 280 days (40 weeks). 02/03/2012 + 280 days. Let's calculate. 2012 is leap year. Feb 3 2012. Add 280 days. Let's compute: 2012-02-03 to 2012-12-31? Let's do month by month. Feb 2012: 29 days total. From Feb 3 to Feb 29 inclusive? Actually days remaining in Feb after Feb 3: Feb 3 to Feb 29 = 27 days (since Feb 3 is day 3, days left including 3? Let's just add 280 days straightforward: use date arithmetic mentally. Better: Use known due date: LMP Feb 3 2012 + 280 days = Aug 9 2012? Let's check: 280 days is 9 months 10 days? Actually 280 days ~ 9 months 10 days. Starting Feb 3, add 9 months -> Nov 3, add 10 days -> Nov 13. That seems wrong. Let's compute precisely. Let's use days: Feb 3 to Mar 3 = 28 days (since Feb 2012 has 29 days, but from Feb 3 to Mar 3 is 28 days). Then to Apr 3 = 30 days, to May 3 = 31 days, to Jun 3 = 30 days, to Jul 3 = 31 days, to Aug 3 = 31 days, to Sep 3 = 30 days, to Oct 3 = 31 days, to Nov 3 = 30 days. Sum days from Feb 3 to Nov 3: 28+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30 = 272 days. Need 280 days, so 8 more days after Nov 3 -> Nov 11. So due date = Nov 11 2012. Let's double-check: 280 days after Feb 3 2012 is Nov 11 2012. Yes. Return date in M/D/Y: 11/11/2012.

Naegele's Rule involves adding 280 days to the LMP for a standard 28-day cycle. Here's the step-by-step calculation: 1. Start with the LMP: February 3, 2012. 2. Add 7 days to the LMP: February 3 + 7 days = February 10, 2012. 3. Subtract 3 months from the resulting date: Subtracting 3 months from February 10, 2012, takes us to November 10, 2011. 4. Since we subtracted 3 months from February 10, 2012, we need to adjust the year if necessary. Subtracting 3 months from February takes us to November of the previous year. So, November 10, 2011 is the intermediate step. 5. Now, add 1 year to this date to get the due date: November 10, 2011 + 1 year = November 10, 2012. Thus, the estimated due date is November 10, 2012.

Actually 280 days ~ 9 months 10 days. Starting Feb 3, add 9 months -> Nov 3, add 10 days -> Nov 13. That seems wrong. Let's compute precisely. Let's use days: Feb 3 to Mar 3 = 28 days (since Feb 2012 has 29 days, but from Feb 3 to Mar 3 is 28 days). Then to Apr 3 = 30 days, to May 3 = 31 days, to Jun 3 = 30 days, to Jul 3 = 31 days, to Aug 3 = 31 days, to Sep 3 = 30 days, to Oct 3 = 31 days, to Nov 3 = 30 days. Sum days from Feb 3 to Nov 3: 28+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30 = 272 days. Need 280 days, so 8 more days after Nov 3 -> Nov 11. So due date = Nov 11 2012. Let's double-check: 280 days after Feb 3 2012 is Nov 11 2012. Yes. Return date in M/D/Y: 11/11/2012.", 'LLM Explanation': '1. Naegele’s Rule adds 280 days (40 weeks) to the LMP.\\n2.

Therefore the estimated due date is 11/11/2012.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '11/10/2012', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule for the patient with the last menstrual period (LMP) on 02/03/2012 and a cycle length of 28 days, we follow these steps: 1. Naegele's Rule states that the estimated due date (EDD) is calculated by adding 280 days to the first day of the LMP for a typical 28-day cycle. 2. The LMP is February 3, 2012. 3. According to Naegele's Rule, another common method is to add 7 days to the first day of the LMP and then subtract 3 months and add one year. Let's apply this method step-by-step: Step 1: Add 7 days to the LMP. February 3, 2012 + 7 days = February 10, 2012. Step 2: Subtract 3 months from February 10, 2012. Subtracting 3 months from February takes us back to November. Specifically, February 10 minus 3 months is November 10. So, November 10, 2011. Step 3: Add one year to the result from Step 2. November 10, 2011 + 1 year = November 10, 2012. Therefore, the estimated due date is November 10, 2012. Thus, the estimated due date is 11/10/2012.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '11/09/2012', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's estimated due date based on their last period is computed by using Naegele's Rule. Using Naegele's Rule, we add 40 weeks to the patient's last menstrual period date. We then add or subtract days from the patient's estimated due date depending on how many more or less days a patient's cycle length is from the standard 28 days. \nThe patient's last menstrual period was 02/03/2012. \nThe date after adding 40 weeks to the patient's last menstrual period date is 11/09/2012. \nBecause the patient's cycle length is 28 days, we do not make any changes to the date. Hence, the patient's estimated due date is 11-09-2012. ", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
An 81-year-old female presents for a pre-operative assessment before a scheduled high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. She has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. She has no history of congestive heart failure and denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea. On examination, her blood pressure is stable at 130/85 mmHg, the pulse rate is 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97 % on room air. She has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin, with good glycemic control. Her creatinine level is maintained at a steady-state of 120 µmol/L. She is referred for further cardiology evaluation for perioperative risk assessment and management due to the high-risk nature of the planned surgery.

So risk index 1.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the factors for the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI): The RCRI includes the following risk factors: 1. Ischemic heart disease (unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months) 2. Congestive heart failure 3. Cerebrovascular disease within the last 6 months 4. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin 5. Kidney disease (creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, which is approximately > 176.8 µmol/L) 6. Surgery type (high-risk surgery) Step 2: Evaluate each factor based on the patient's information: 1. **Ischemic heart disease (unstable angina or MI within the last 6 months):** - The patient has no history of chest pain or dyspnea, and there's no mention of unstable angina or MI within the last 6 months. - Score: 0 2. **Congestive heart failure:** - The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. - Score: 0 3. **Cerebrovascular disease within the last 6 months:** - The patient has a past cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but it is not specified if it was within the last 6 months. Since the note says "past CVA with residual left-sided weakness," it implies that the CVA occurred some time ago and is not necessarily within the last 6 months. - Score: 0 4. **Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin:** - The patient has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin. - Score: 1 5. **Kidney disease (creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, which is approximately > 176.8 µmol/L):** - The patient's creatinine level is 120 µmol/L. - Since 120 µmol/L < 176.8 µmol/L, this criterion is not met. - Score: 0 6. **Surgery type (high-risk surgery):** - The patient is scheduled for a high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. - This is considered a high-risk surgery. - Score: 1 Now, let's add up the scores from the above factors: - Ischemic heart disease: 0 - Congestive heart failure: 0 - Cerebrovascular disease within the last 6 months: 0 - Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin: 1 - Kidney disease (creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL): 0 - High-risk surgery: 1 Total score = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 According to the RCRI, the total score is 2. The interpretation of the RCRI score is as follows: - 0 points: 1.2% risk of cardiac complications - 1 point: 2.3% risk - 2 points: 4.0% risk - 3 points: 7.9% risk - 4 points: 11.0% risk - 5 points: 20.5% risk So the patient's Cardiac Risk Index is 2. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Cardiac Risk Index using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), we need to evaluate the following factors: \n1.

Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 µmol. To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

To convert 0.014 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

 Here is the patient note:
A 75-year-old female residing in a nursing home is brought to the outpatient department by her nurse for a regular health check. Her medical records indicate a past history of congestive heart failure but no known liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Today's examination finds her mentally alert with a body temperature reading of 36.5 degrees celsisus, a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure measuring at 128/80 mm Hg. Laboratory results are collected; hematocrit at 39 %, glucose elevated to 180 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) slightly high at 27 mg/dL, and sodium within normal limits at 139 mEq/L.

So answer 86.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to use the given patient information and apply the PSI scoring system. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. **Age**: The patient is 75 years old. According to the PSI scoring system, for age: - 75 years old corresponds to 75 points. 2. **Gender**: The patient is female. The PSI scoring system assigns 0 points for females. 3. **Comorbidities**: - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Present. This gives 5 points. - No liver disease: 0 points. - No neoplastic conditions: 0 points. 4. **Vital Signs and Lab Results**: - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute. The PSI scoring system assigns points for respiratory rate as follows: - >30: 5 points - 21-30: 3 points - 13-20: 0 points - <13: 2 points Since the respiratory rate is 22, it falls into the range 21-30, which gives 3 points. But I made an error in my initial thinking. Let's correct this. The correct scoring for respiratory rate is: - >30: 5 points - 21-30: 3 points - 13-20: 0 points - <13: 2 points Since the respiratory rate is 22, it falls into the range 21-30, which gives 3 points. - Heart rate: 82 beats per minute. The PSI scoring system assigns points for heart rate as follows: - >125: 5 points - 101-125: 3 points - 61-100: 0 points - <60: 2 points Since the heart rate is 82, it falls into the range 61-100, which gives 0 points. - Systolic Blood Pressure: 128 mm Hg. The PSI scoring system assigns points for systolic blood pressure as follows: - <90: 5 points - 90-100: 3 points - >100: 0 points Since the systolic blood pressure is 128, it falls into the range >100, which gives 0 points. - Temperature: 36.5 degrees Celsius. The PSI scoring system assigns points for temperature as follows: - <36: 2 points - 36-37: 0 points - >37: 2 points Since the temperature is 36.5, it falls into the range 36-37, which gives 0 points. - Sodium: 139 mEq/L. The PSI scoring system assigns points for sodium levels as follows: - <130: 5 points - 130-139: 0 points - >139: 0 points Since the sodium level is 139, it falls into the range 130-139, which gives 0 points. - Glucose: 180 mg/dL. The PSI scoring system assigns points for glucose levels as follows: - <40: 5 points - 40-70: 3 points - 71-140: 0 points - 141-220: 0 points - >220: 2 points Since the glucose level is 180, it falls into the range 141-220, which gives 0 points. - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL. The PSI scoring system assigns points for BUN levels as follows: - <10: 0 points - 10-20: 0 points - 21-40: 1 point - >40: 3 points Since the BUN level is 27, it falls into the range 21-40, which gives 1 point. - PaO2: 80 mm Hg. The PSI scoring system assigns points for PaO2 as follows: - <60: 5 points - 60-79: 3 points - >=80: 0 points Since the PaO2 is 80, it falls into the range >=80, which gives 0 points. 5. **Chest X-ray findings**: The chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. The PSI scoring system assigns 5 points for pleural effusion. 6. **Mental Status**: The patient is mentally alert. The PSI scoring system assigns 0 points for being alert. Now, let's sum up all the points: - Age: 75 points - Gender: 0 points - CHF: 5 points - Respiratory rate: 3 points - Heart rate: 0 points - Systolic BP: 0 points - Temperature: 0 points - Sodium: 0 points - Glucose: 0 points - BUN: 1 point - PaO2: 0 points - Pleural effusion: 5 points - Mental status: 0 points Adding these up: 75 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 89 points. Now, we need to determine the PSI class based on the total score of 89 points. The PSI classes are as follows: - Class I: 0-34 points - Class II: 35-49 points - Class III: 50-74 points - Class IV: 75-97 points - Class V: >=98 points Since the total score is 89, it falls into Class IV (75-97 points). However, the PSI score itself is the sum of the points, which is 89. So the PSI score is 89.

So the PSI score is 89.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 75.0 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75.0 = 75.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 75.0 - 10 = 65.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 10 = 85.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 85.0 + 10 = 95.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 82.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 95.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 95.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 128.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 27.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL Need albumin corrected delta ratio. Usually albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0)?? Wait albumin corrected ratio used in proteinuria? Actually albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). But maybe they mean albumin corrected ratio for proteinuria: (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). But we have albumin 3.8 g/dL. So ratio = (3.8/4.0)*(creatinine/1.0). But creatinine 10.48 mg/dL. So ratio = 0.95 * 10.48 = 9.956. But maybe they want albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). So answer ~9.96. Let's produce.

A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

<think>Need albumin corrected delta ratio. Usually albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0)?? Wait albumin corrected ratio used in proteinuria? Actually albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). But maybe they mean albumin corrected ratio for proteinuria: (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). But we have albumin 3.8 g/dL. So ratio = (3.8/4.0)*(creatinine/1.0). But creatinine 10.48 mg/dL. So ratio = 0.95 * 10.48 = 9.956. But maybe they want albumin corrected ratio = (serum albumin / 4.0) * (serum creatinine / 1.0). So answer ~9.96. Let's produce.</think>

The term "albumin corrected delta ratio" is not a standard term in nephrology or medicine that I am familiar with. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a miscommunication in the question. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the key information from the patient note. - The patient has a creatinine level of 10.48 mg/dL. - The patient's albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. Step 2: Understand the term "albumin corrected delta ratio." The term "albumin-corrected creatinine" is sometimes used to adjust the creatinine level based on the albumin level. However, the term "delta ratio" is not clear in this context. If we assume that the question is asking for the albumin-corrected creatinine, the formula is: Corrected Creatinine = (Measured Creatinine) * (4.0 / Serum Albumin) Using the given values: Measured Creatinine = 10.48 mg/dL Serum Albumin = 3.8 g/dL Corrected Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8) = 10.48 * 1.05263 ≈ 10.48 * 1.053 ≈ 10.48 * 1.053 ≈ 11.03 So the albumin-corrected creatinine is approximately 11.03 mg/dL. But since the term "delta ratio" is not defined in the context provided, I am unable to calculate the "albumin-corrected delta ratio." It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Since the term "albumin-corrected delta ratio" is not standard and unclear, I will assume the question is asking for the albumin-corrected creatinine. Thus the answer is approximately 11.03. But since the question is unclear, I will provide the step-by-step thinking and the best possible interpretation. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected creatinine, we use the formula: Corrected Creatinine = (Measured Creatinine) * (4.0 / Serum Albumin). Given the measured creatinine is 10.48 mg/dL and the serum albumin is 3.8 g/dL, we plug in these values into the formula. Corrected Creatinine = 10.48 * (4.0 / 3.8). This simplifies to 10.48 * 1.05263 ≈ 11.03 mg/dL. Therefore, the albumin-corrected creatinine is approximately 11.03 mg/dL. Since the term 'albumin-corrected delta ratio' is not standard and unclear, I am assuming the question is asking for the albumin-corrected creatinine.", "answer": "11.03"} But since the term "albumin-corrected delta ratio" is not defined in the context, the answer is not directly applicable.

{'Row Number': 825, 'Calculator Name': 'Albumin Corrected Delta Ratio', 'Calculator ID': '67', 'Category': 'lab', 'Note ID': 'pmc-4528898-1', 'Patient Note': 'A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Explanation': "name 'N' is not defined", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.25', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 100.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.8 (in g/dL)) = 12.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.5 - 12 = 0.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.5 mEq/L / 2.0 mEq/L = 0.25. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.25.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.
Physical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.
His initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.

The FeverPAIN score is calculated based on the following criteria: - Fever > 38.5°C (1 point) - Purulent exudate (1 point) - Influenza-like symptoms (1 point) - Age > 12 years (1 point) - No cough (1 point) Step 2: Evaluate each criterion for the given patient. 1. **Fever > 38.5°C**: The patient's temperature is 39.6°C. This is greater than 38.5°C. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **Purulent exudate**: The patient has "white exudates" on the tonsils. White exudates can be considered purulent. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 3. **Influenza-like symptoms**: Influenza-like symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. The patient has fever and some symptoms like drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, but no mention of cough, sore throat (though tonsillar involvement is present), runny nose, muscle aches, or other typical influenza-like symptoms. Since the presence of influenza-like symptoms is not explicitly clear from the given information, we will assume this criterion is not met unless specifically mentioned. Score = 0. 4. **Age > 12 years**: The patient is 3 years old. This criterion is not met. Score = 0. 5. **No cough**: The patient note does not mention a cough. Therefore, we can assume there is no cough. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1. Now, let's add up the scores from the criteria that were met: - Fever > 38.5°C: 1 point - Purulent exudate: 1 point - Influenza-like symptoms: 0 points - Age > 12 years: 0 points - No cough: 1 point Total FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3. So the FeverPAIN score is 3. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we need to evaluate the following criteria for the patient:\n1. Fever > 38.5°C\n2. Purulent exudate\n3. Influenza-like symptoms\n4. Age > 12 years\n5. No cough\n\nLet's evaluate each criterion based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Fever > 38.5°C**: The patient's temperature is 39.6°C, which is greater than 38.5°C. Therefore, this criterion is met. Score = 1.\n\n2. **Purulent exudate**: The patient has \"white exudates\" on the tonsils. White exudates can be considered purulent. Therefore, this criterion is met. Score = 1.\n\n3. **Influenza-like symptoms**: The patient has fever, drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, and inability to eat solids. However, the presence of typical influenza-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, etc., is not explicitly mentioned. Since the presence of influenza-like symptoms is not clearly stated, we will assume this criterion is not met. Score = 0.\n\n4. **Age > 12 years**: The patient is 3 years old. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0.\n\n5. **No cough**: The patient note does not mention a cough. Therefore, we can assume there is no cough. So, this criterion is met. Score = 1.\n\nNow, let's sum up the scores from the criteria that were met:\n- Fever > 38.5°C: 1 point\n- Purulent exudate: 1 point\n- Influenza-like symptoms: 0 points\n- Age > 12 years: 0 points\n- No cough: 1 point\n\nTotal FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3.", "answer": "3"}

 Here is the patient note:
An 83-year-old male with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes developed acute right-sided hemiparesis and fluent aphasia (NIHSS score on admission: 4). He arrived at our hospital 45 min later. On admission, his blood pressure was 160/70 mm Hg; atrial fibrillation was detected on electrocardiography. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed no early signs of cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was unable to self-report his drug history due to persisting aphasia. The INR measured by a commercial POC device was within normal range (1.00; normal 0.85-1.18). IVT (rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg) was initiated 80 min after symptom onset and before all laboratory findings were received. Around 20 min after IVT had commenced, coagulation parameters were normal [including INR (1.10), thrombin time (18.8 s; normal 14-21), partial thromboplastin time (34.8 s, normal 23-36) and platelet counts]. A follow-up cCT ruled out IVT-induced ICH and the patient fully recovered within 48 h (NIHS score: 0). At this stage, he was able to report regular intake of apixaban (Eliquis®, 2.5 mg t.i.d.) since April 2014 due to atrial fibrillation. The last apixaban tablet had been taken 13.5 h before IVT.

So total 3+1+1=5.</think> However, let's break this down step-by-step systematically. Step 1: Identify the components of the CHA2DS2-VASc score. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to assess the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The components are: - C: Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction - H: Hypertension - A2: Age ≥75 years - D: Diabetes mellitus - S2: Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism - V: Vascular disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, aortic plaque) - A: Age 65-74 years - S: Sex category (female) Step 2: Evaluate each component based on the information provided in the patient note. - **C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction):** Not mentioned in the patient note. Therefore, we assume this is 0. - **H (Hypertension):** The patient has a history of arterial hypertension. This gives 1 point. - **A2 (Age ≥75 years):** The patient is 83 years old, which is greater than or equal to 75 years. This gives 2 points. - **D (Diabetes mellitus):** The patient has a history of diabetes. This gives 1 point. - **S2 (Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism):** No prior history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism is mentioned. Therefore, this is 0. - **V (Vascular disease):** No mention of myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque. Therefore, this is 0. - **A (Age 65-74 years):** Since the patient is 83 years old, this category does not apply (as he is older than 74). Therefore, this is 0. - **S (Sex category - female):** The patient is male. Therefore, this is 0. Now, let's add up the points: - C: 0 - H: 1 - A2: 2 - D: 1 - S2: 0 - V: 0 - A: 0 - S: 0 Total CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4 So the CHA2DS2-VASc score for this patient is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score, we need to evaluate each component based on the information provided in the patient note.\n\n- C (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction): Not mentioned, so 0 points.\n- H (Hypertension): Yes, the patient has a history of arterial hypertension.

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy two-year-old African American female presented with a two-month history of epistaxis and easy bruising. She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder.
One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L.
Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L.
During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts. She eventually received intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 every week as an outpatient for four doses and she is currently on a replacement IVIg course once a month for six months. Her present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count. She has not been hospitalized since starting rituximab and IVIg for 7 mo.

<think>Need FIB-4 formula: (Age * AST) / (Platelet count * sqrt(ALT)). Age? Not given. Probably current age: started 2-year-old, now 4 months after AIH diagnosis, so age ~2.3 years? But FIB-4 uses years. Use 2.3? But unrealistic. Maybe use age at time of last labs: 2 years old. Use 2. So compute: Age 2 * AST 87 / (Platelet 101000 * sqrt(104)). sqrt(104)=10.198. Platelet 101000. So numerator 174. Denominator 101000*10.198=1,030,798. 174/1,030,798=0.000169. So answer ~0.00017.</think>

She was admitted to the University of South Alabama Children’s and Women’s hospital in May 2015. Examination was remarkable for few healing bruises without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests (Table ) showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 75 fL, white blood cell count of 14800/μL, platelet count of 61000/μL and reticulocyte count of 8%. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 387 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase was 449 IU/L. Coagulation studies were normal and the viral panels including anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, CMV-IgM, EBV-VCA-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EB early Ag, EBnA, Parvovirus, and HSV-IgM were negative. Further laboratory evaluations yielded a negative anti-nuclear antibody, positive antiplatelet antibody and direct Coomb’s test positive for both IgG and anti-compliment factor 3 antibody. Thus, a diagnosis of ES was made. After treatment with single 1 g/kg dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) followed by oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg per day, her hemoglobin improved from 8.4 to 10.9 g/dL and corticosteroids were discontinued but she was lost to follow-up overtime. She was hospitalized a few times for intravenous antibiotics due to a bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis. Her ES remained stable during this time. Immune work up showed normal immunoglobulin levels. (Immunoglobulin G 1.090 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin A 114 mg/dL, Immunoglobulin M 86 mg/dL and Immunoglobulin E 148 kU/L), normal absolute lymphocyte counts and sub-set population (including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, no double negative T cells) via flow cytometry without evidence of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder. One year later, she developed jaundice and pruritus, hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13-cm and increased echogenicity without gallstones on abdominal ultrasound. Her laboratory findings included AST 547 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 600 IU/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, total protein 7.9 g/dL, total bilirubin 10.2 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 13.5 s, partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 31 s, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.02, positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:40), positive smooth muscle antibody (1:40), positive F actin antibody (39 units) and elevated total serum IgG (1090 mg/dL). The anti-liver-kidney-microsome antibody, anti-HAV-IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were all negative. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal. Prior to percutaneous liver biopsy, she received packed red blood cell (for associated AIHA flare with Hb 4.9 g/dL and reticulocyte count 44%) and fresh frozen plasma. Her pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL, PT 10.9 s, INR 1.0, and aPTT 31 s. She received high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg per day for 3 d) and oral ursodiol after percutaneously liver biopsy due to suspected AIH type 1. She was discharged with oral prednisone therapy after liver biopsy. Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L. Liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate including lymphoid cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, histiocytic cells and plasma cells in addition to periportal fibrosis with rare portal-portal septa (stage 2 fibrosis) along with canalicular and hepatocytic cholestasis, indicating AIH. One month later after a high dose of methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, her AST improved to 194 IU/L and ALT to 424 IU/L. Shortly after, she was started on oral azathioprine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day. Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L. During her hospitalization for AIH, she also had a flare up of ES, with a drop in hemoglobin to 4.9 g/dL and elevated reticulocyte count up to 44% but stable normal platelet counts.

So answer ~0.00017.</think> But this seems incorrect because the patient's age is likely to be older than 2 years by the time of the last labs. Let's calculate the time elapsed since the initial presentation. The patient was admitted in May 2015 when she was 2 years old. The current time is 4 months after the diagnosis of AIH. Let's assume the diagnosis of AIH occurred approximately one year after the initial presentation (since it mentions "one year later" she developed jaundice and pruritus). If the initial presentation was in May 2015, and the AIH diagnosis occurred one year later, that would be May 2016. Four months after May 2016 would be September 2016. If the patient was 2 years old in May 2015, by September 2016, she would be approximately 2 years + 1 year + 4 months = 3 years and 4 months old. Let's use the age of 3.33 years (approximately 3 years and 4 months). Now we need the AST and ALT values and the platelet count at the time we're calculating the FIB-4 index. From the last part of the note: "Currently (4 mo after diagnosis of AIH), her AIH is controlled very well with oral azathioprine and oral prednisone, her present AST is 87 IU/L and ALT is 104 IU/L." And the platelet count from the pre-biopsy lab: "pre-biopsy hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dL with platelet count 101000 /mcL." Let's use the platelet count of 101000 /mcL from the pre-biopsy lab since the platelet count is stable and normal according to the note. Now we have: - Age = 3.33 years - AST = 87 IU/L - ALT = 104 IU/L - Platelet count = 101000 /mcL Now we can calculate the FIB-4 index using the formula: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{\text{(Age} \times \text{AST)}}{\text{(Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}})} \] Let's calculate it step by step. 1. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{104} \approx 10.198 \] 2. Multiply the age by AST: \[ \text{Age} \times \text{AST} = 3.33 \times 87 = 289.71 \] 3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: \[ \text{Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = 101000 \times 10.198 \approx 1029998 \] 4. Now divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{289.71}{1029998} \approx 0.000281 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000281. But this seems very low. Let's check if there's another set of values we should use. Let's use the values from the time of the liver biopsy. From the note: "Before discharge, her AST was 677 IU/L and ALT 1094 IU/L." And the pre-biopsy platelet count was 101000 /mcL. Let's calculate the FIB-4 index using these values and the age at the time of the liver biopsy. If the liver biopsy occurred in May 2016 (one year after the initial presentation), the patient would be approximately 3 years old at that time. Now we have: - Age = 3 years - AST = 677 IU/L - ALT = 1094 IU/L - Platelet count = 101000 /mcL Let's calculate the FIB-4 index step by step for this set of values. 1. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{1094} \approx 33.076 \] 2. Multiply the age by AST: \[ \text{Age} \times \text{AST} = 3 \times 677 = 2031 \] 3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: \[ \text{Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = 101000 \times 33.076 \approx 3,340,676 \] 4. Now divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{2031}{3340676} \approx 0.000608 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000608. This is still quite low. Let's try the values from the time of the last labs mentioned for AIH control: - AST = 87 IU/L - ALT = 104 IU/L And the platelet count from the last labs: "present labs show hemoglobin of 14 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 4.7% and a normal white blood cells and platelets count." Let's assume the platelet count is within the normal range. A typical normal platelet count is between 150,000 to 400,000 /mcL. Let's use the midpoint, 275,000 /mcL. The patient's age at this point is 3 years and 4 months (approximately 3.33 years). Now we have: - Age = 3.33 years - AST = 87 IU/L - ALT = 104 IU/L - Platelet count = 275000 /mcL Let's calculate the FIB-4 index using these values. 1. Calculate the square root of ALT: \[ \sqrt{104} \approx 10.198 \] 2. Multiply the age by AST: \[ \text{Age} \times \text{AST} = 3.33 \times 87 = 289.71 \] 3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: \[ \text{Platelet count} \times \sqrt{\text{ALT}} = 275000 \times 10.198 \approx 2,799,450 \] 4. Now divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: \[ \text{FIB-4} = \frac{289.71}{2799450} \approx 0.000103 \] So the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000103. It seems that the FIB-4 index is consistently very low across different sets of values. Given the context and the values provided, the most appropriate set of values to use for the FIB-4 index calculation is likely the one from the time of the liver biopsy, as this is when the liver function tests were most abnormal and relevant to the diagnosis of AIH. Thus, the FIB-4 index using the values from the time of the liver biopsy is approximately 0.000608. So the final answer is approximately 0.0006. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FIB-4 index, we need the patient's age, AST, ALT, and platelet count.

(Note: the platelet count is expressed in 10^9/L, so the denominator is 1030.2, not 1,030,000.)\\n\\nThus the patient’s FIB‑4 index is approximately 0.17.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '0.0006', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the FIB-4 index, we need the patient's age, AST, ALT, and platelet count. The FIB-4 formula is (Age * AST) / (Platelet count * sqrt(ALT)).\\n\\n1. We first identified the patient's age at different points in the timeline.\\n- The patient was 2 years old at the initial presentation in May 2015.\\n- One year later (May 2016), she developed jaundice and pruritus.\\n- Four months after the diagnosis of AIH (which occurred in May 2016), it is September 2016.\\n- Therefore, the patient's age in September 2016 is approximately 3 years and 4 months, or about 3.33 years.\\n\\n2. We identified the relevant lab values for AST, ALT, and platelet count.\\n- For the current labs (4 months after AIH diagnosis): AST = 87 IU/L, ALT = 104 IU/L.\\n- The platelet count from the pre-biopsy lab was 101000 /mcL.\\n\\nUsing these values:\\n- Age = 3.33 years\\n- AST = 87 IU/L\\n- ALT = 104 IU/L\\n- Platelet count = 101000 /mcL\\n\\nWe calculated the FIB-4 index as follows:\\n1. Calculate the square root of ALT: sqrt(104) ≈ 10.198.\\n2. Multiply the age by AST: 3.33 * 87 = 289.71.\\n3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: 101000 * 10.198 ≈ 1029998.\\n4. Divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: FIB-4 = 289.71 / 1029998 ≈ 0.000281.\\n\\nThis gives us a very low FIB-4 index of approximately 0.000281.\\n\\nNext, we tried the values from the time of the liver biopsy:\\n- Age = 3 years (since the liver biopsy occurred around May 2016).\\n- AST = 677 IU/L\\n- ALT = 1094 IU/L\\n- Platelet count = 101000 /mcL.\\n\\nCalculating the FIB-4 index for these values:\\n1. Calculate the square root of ALT: sqrt(1094) ≈ 33.076.\\n2. Multiply the age by AST: 3 * 677 = 2031.\\n3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: 101000 * 33.076 ≈ 3,340,676.\\n4. Divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: FIB-4 = 2031 / 3340676 ≈ 0.000608.\\n\\nThis gives us a FIB-4 index of approximately 0.000608.\\n\\nLastly, we used the values from the last labs for AIH control:\\n- AST = 87 IU/L\\n- ALT = 104 IU/L\\nAssuming a normal platelet count of 275000 /mcL.\\n- Age = 3.33 years.\\n\\nCalculating the FIB-4 index for these values:\\n1. Calculate the square root of ALT: sqrt(104) ≈ 10.198.\\n2. Multiply the age by AST: 3.33 * 87 = 289.71.\\n3. Multiply the platelet count by the square root of ALT: 275000 * 10.198 ≈ 2,799,450.\\n4. Divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: FIB-4 = 289.71 / 2799450 ≈ 0.000103.\\n\\nThis gives us a FIB-4 index of approximately 0.000103.\\n\\nAmong the three sets of calculations, the FIB-4 index from the time of the liver biopsy seems the most relevant to the diagnosis of AIH and the severity of liver disease at that time. Therefore, the FIB-4 index is approximately 0.000608.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0.169', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * √ALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 87.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 104.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 101000.0 count/µL. To convert 101000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 101000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 101000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 101000000000.0/(10^9) = 101.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (2 * 87.0)/(101.0 * sqrt(104.0)) = 0.169.\nHence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 0.169.", 'Result': 'Correct', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 27%|██▋       | 27/100 [30:59<1:44:28, 85.88s/it]

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score includes the following factors: - H: Hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled BP >140/90 mmHg) - A: Abnormal Renal/Liver function - Abnormal renal function: Creatinine >133 μmol/L or eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m² - Abnormal liver function: Cirrhosis or other liver disease - S: Stroke history - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (INR outside the therapeutic range) - E: Elderly (>65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of NSAIDs or alcohol) Now let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has a documented history of hypertension. - Score: 1 2. **A: Abnormal Renal/Liver function** - The patient has a kidney transplant (suggests abnormal renal function). - The patient has suggestive signs of hepatic cirrhosis (suggests abnormal liver function). - Since both abnormal renal and liver function are present, we count this as 1 point for abnormal renal function and 1 point for abnormal liver function. - Score: 1 (renal) + 1 (liver) = 2 3. **S: Stroke history** - The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) last year. - TIA is considered a stroke history. - Score: 1 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient denies using any medication known to exacerbate bleeding such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents. - There is no clear history of a major bleeding episode or any known coagulation disorders that predispose her to bleeding. - Score: 0 5. **L: Labile INR** - The blood investigations show a stable international normalized ratio (INR). - Score: 0 6. **E: Elderly (>65 years)** - The patient is 22 years old. - Score: 0 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol** - The patient admits to drinking more than moderately, with an average of 12 alcoholic beverages per week. - Alcohol consumption >8 drinks/week is considered a risk factor. - Score: 1 Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal Renal/Liver function): 1 (renal) + 1 (liver) = 2 - S (Stroke history): 1 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly): 0 - D (Drugs/alcohol): 1 Adding these up: 1 (H) + 2 (A) + 1 (S) + 0 (B) + 0 (L) + 0 (E) + 1 (D) = 5 Therefore, the HAS-BLED score is 5. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the HAS-BLED score for the patient, we evaluate each component:\n\n1. **H: Hypertension**: The patient has a documented history of hypertension.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old African-American female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of generalized cramping abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting. She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().
During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.
The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units).
Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.
Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.
The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca (). During the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate. The patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0–20 units). Although chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point. Light microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN. The patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis. She was also started on HAART therapy prior to discharge. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained compliant with HAART therapy and dialysis dependent.

Given: - Serum creatinine (Scr) = 14.6 mg/dL - Age = 27 years - Gender = Female - Race = African-American Let's plug these values into the MDRD equation step by step.

Step 3: Combine all the factors together. \[ GFR = 175 \times 0.044 \times 0.513 \times 0.742 \times 1.212 \] Now, let's multiply these step by step. First, multiply 175 and 0.044: \[ 175 \times 0.044 = 7.7 \] Next, multiply the result by 0.513: \[ 7.7 \times 0.513 \approx 3.944 \] Then, multiply by 0.742: \[ 3.944 \times 0.742 \approx 2.924 \] Finally, multiply by 1.212: \[ 2.924 \times 1.212 \approx 3.54 \] So the GFR is approximately 3.54 mL/min/1.73 m².

 Here is the patient note:
We present the case of a 45-year-old gentleman, known diabetic for 6 years on metformin 1 g, twice a day, with reasonable control (hemoglobin A1c 6.4%). He was admitted to our emergency feeling unwell with 2 days’ history of vomiting and watery diarrhea, also associated crampy periumbilical pain. He denied a history of similar complaints in his companions, no change in his dietary habits preceding symptoms’ onset. He drinks alcohol occasionally; the last drink was 6 months before the presentation—no illicit drug use history. The initial vital signs were normal. Soon later, he became tachycardic with heart rate reaching 120 bpm, blood pressure 127/70 mmHg, and a normal temperature. He looked dehydrated; otherwise, his examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory workup was significant for initially low glucose 2.5 mmol/L (3.3–5.5 mmol/L), high serum creatinine 632 μmol/L (62–106 umol/L), and high blood urea nitrogen of 21 mmol/L (2.8–8 mmol/L). Serum electrolytes were as follows: potassium (K+) 6.3 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), sodium (NA) 144 mmol/L (135–145mmol/L), bicarbonate (HCO3) 5.8 mmol/L (23–29 mmol/L), and serum chloride 99 mmol/L (99–107 mmol/L). Serum aminotransferases were normal (ALT 31 U/L, AST 27 U/L). He had significant high AG metabolic acidosis with PH of 6.8 (7.35–7.45) and AG of 40, lactic acid (LA) strikingly high reaching up to 24 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L). With LA of 19 mmol/L, his OG measured 20 with serum osmolarity of 340 mmol/kg (275–295 mmol/kg). Toxicology screening, including serum ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylate, and urine for oxalate crystal, was negative.
Acidosis failed to respond to initial fluid hydration, including intravenous bicarbonate. Thus, the patient underwent 2 sessions of sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (HD). After HD, his electrolyte disturbances improved, and intravenous fluid hydration continued. Acute kidney injury (AKI) workup, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, creatinine kinase level, and sepsis workup were unremarkable. Starting day 3, the patient was in a polyuric phase, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), producing between 3 and 6 L per day, and his serum creatinine was decreasing. He was discharged after 8 days of hospitalization in good condition with a serum creatinine of 140 μmol/L (62–106 μmol/L). Figure shows serum creatinine trend during the hospitalization, Figure depicts serum lactic acid clearance during hospitalization.
Our patient had an AKI with significant lactic acidosis and an OG. Given the significant level of lactic acid, MALA was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was on metformin for a long time, and he did not attempt an overdose; hence, we think that MALA was likely precipitated by dehydration leading to prerenal insult and AKI. Eventually, his prerenal insult led to acute tubular necrosis, as evident by the polyuric phase the patient exhibited on day three.

The correct formula for the Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval is actually not the one I used. The Hodges formula is not a standard formula for correcting the QT interval. The most commonly used formulas for correcting the QT interval are the Bazett's formula, Fridericia's formula, and the Framingham formula. However, since the task seems to be asking for the Hodges formula and I couldn't find a standard Hodges formula for the corrected QT interval, I will assume that the task might have a mistake or is referring to a less common formula. Let's use the Bazett's formula for the corrected QT interval as a common approach. The Bazett's formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} \] where the RR interval is the reciprocal of the heart rate (HR). The heart rate is given in beats per minute (bpm), and the RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG, typically measured in seconds. The relationship between the heart rate (HR) and the RR interval is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} \] Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec First, calculate the RR interval: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{154} \approx 0.3896 \, \text{seconds} \] Now, apply the Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3896}} \] Calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{0.3896} \approx 0.6242 \] Now, plug this into the Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{330}{0.6242} \approx 528.7 \, \text{msec} \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 529 msec. However, since the task specifically mentions the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, let's assume the task might be referring to a different formula or there might be a mistake. Let's try another common formula, the Fridericia's formula: The Fridericia's formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Fridericia} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\text{RR}^{1/3}} \] Using the same RR interval we calculated earlier: \[ \text{RR} \approx 0.3896 \, \text{seconds} \] Now, calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \text{RR}^{1/3} = (0.3896)^{1/3} \approx 0.7303 \] Now, apply the Fridericia's formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Fridericia} = \frac{330}{0.7303} \approx 452.0 \, \text{msec} \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 452 msec. Since the task specifically asks for the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, I will assume that the task might have a mistake or is referring to a less common formula. Let's try the Framingham formula as another approach: The Framingham formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = \text{QT} + 0.154 \times (\text{HR} - 60) \] Given: - Heart rate (HR) = 154 bpm - QT interval = 330 msec Now, calculate the term $(\text{HR} - 60)$: \[ \text{HR} - 60 = 154 - 60 = 94 \] Now, plug this into the Framingham formula: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = 330 + 0.154 \times 94 \] Calculate $0.154 \times 94$: \[ 0.154 \times 94 = 14.476 \] Now, add this to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc}_\text{Framingham} = 330 + 14.476 \approx 344.476 \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives approximately 344 msec. Since the task specifies the "Hodges Formula," and I couldn't find a standard formula for it, I will assume that the task might be referring to the Framingham formula or another similar formula. Let's try the Hodges formula as it might be a less common formula. The Hodges formula is not a standard formula, but if we assume it is a formula similar to the Framingham formula, let's use the Framingham formula as the closest approximation. So the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is approximately 344 msec. Thus the answer is 344 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula, I first tried to use the Bazett's and Fridericia's formulas since I couldn't find a standard Hodges formula.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male veteran presented with recurrent syncope and falls. He had decreased appetite, thirst, and urine output in the setting of progressive abdominal distention, pruritus, and painless jaundice in the prior month. His past medical history was significant for obesity (BMI=40.1), hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with pertinent medications of ibuprofen (200 mg QID), furosemide (40 mg BID), losartan, doxazosin, and finasteride. A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.
Initial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL. Supporting laboratory findings included elevations in phosphorus (7.6 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (319.7 pg/mL), and low calcium (7.6 mg/dL), ionized calcium (0.93 mmol/L), albumin (2.8 g/dL), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (16.4 ng/mL). There was an anion gap (21 mEq/L) with pH= 7.145 confirmed with arterial blood gas. Jaundice workup revealed an obstructive pattern with elevated total bilirubin (5.4 mg/dL), direct bilirubin (3.7 mg/dL), AST (79 U/L), ALT (140 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (392 U/L), GGT (214 U/L), and lipase (690 U/L). Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.
The etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 μg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas. Serum oxalate was 3.6 mmol/L (normal range 1.0-3.0 mmol/L). A low-fat, low-oxalate diet with calcium citrate and pancrelipase supplementation was started.
Concurrently, a jaundice workup began with abdominal ultrasound which showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, numerous gallstones, and no inferior vena cava or portal circulation thrombosis. Of note, the common bile duct was not visibly dilated, raising concern for an upstream malignant stricture. MRCP showed marked dilation of the left intrahepatic biliary tree with abrupt termination and mild dilation of the right intrahepatic biliary tree, further raising suspicion of malignancy. ERCP with stenting to the right intrahepatic biliary tree duct was performed. Cytology, a markedly elevated CA 19-9, and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). Medical oncology discussed chemotherapy and radiation as alternative treatments, but the patient elected to enter hospice. His kidney function ultimately improved with return of nonoliguric urine output, cessation of dialysis, and improved creatinine to 2.45mg/dL and eGFR of 26 ml/min/1.73m3 at discharge.

 Here is the patient note:
A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.
Two days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.
Past medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.
Physical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.
Initial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 μg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.
At the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.
Renal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.
Physical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.
Renal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.
The patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL Need delta gap: (Bicarbonate - 24) / (BUN - 20). Use admission values? Probably at presentation: bicarbonate 29, BUN 19.3. Use 24 and 20 normal. Delta gap = (29-24)/(19.3-20)=5/(-0.7) = -7.14. But delta gap negative? Usually BUN normal 20. BUN 19.3 slightly low. Maybe use later values: BUN 49.6, bicarbonate 22. Then delta gap = (22-24)/(49.6-20)=(-2)/(29.6)= -0.067. Hmm. Maybe use initial values: BUN 19.3, bicarbonate 29. So delta gap negative. But typical delta gap positive. Maybe use BUN 49.6, bicarbonate 22: delta gap negative small. Which is correct? The question likely expects calculation at admission: BUN 19.3, bicarbonate 29. So delta gap = (29-24)/(19.3-20)=5/(-0.7)= -7.14 mEq/L. Provide that.

BUN 19.3 slightly low. Maybe use later values: BUN 49.6, bicarbonate 22. Then delta gap = (22-24)/(49.6-20)=(-2)/(29.6)= -0.067. Hmm. Maybe use initial values: BUN 19.3, bicarbonate 29. So delta gap negative. But typical delta gap positive. Maybe use BUN 49.6, bicarbonate 22: delta gap negative small. Which is correct? The question likely expects calculation at admission: BUN 19.3, bicarbonate 29. So delta gap = (29-24)/(19.3-20)=5/(-0.7)= -7.14 mEq/L. Provide that.', 'LLM Explanation': '1.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L.

Tender lymphadenopathy is part of the Centor Score, but the note does not explicitly mention tenderness. However, if we assume that the presence of lymphadenopathy implies tenderness (as it is often the case in clinical settings), we can count this as a point. Let's give this a point. 3.

Now let's count the points: - Tonsillar Exudates: 0 points (not mentioned) - Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: 1 point (assuming the presence of lymphadenopathy implies tenderness) - Fever > 38.3°C: 0 points (temperature is 38.2°C) - Absence of Cough: 1 point (no cough mentioned) So the total Centor Score is 1 + 1 = 2 points. However, I made an assumption about the tenderness of the lymphadenopathy. Let's clarify the information given: The note says "posterior cervical lymphadenopathy." The Centor Score requires "tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy." The note specifies "posterior" lymphadenopathy, not "anterior." Therefore, this criterion is not met. So the points are: - Tonsillar Exudates: 0 points - Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: 0 points (posterior lymphadenopathy is not the same as anterior) - Fever > 38.3°C: 0 points - Absence of Cough: 1 point Thus the total Centor Score is 1 point. Therefore, the Centor Score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the following criteria:\n1. Tonsillar exudates or swelling\n2. Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy\n3. Fever > 38.3°C (100.9°F)\n4. Absence of cough\n\nLet's evaluate each criterion for the given patient:\n\n1. Tonsillar Exudates: The note mentions an 'erythematous oropharynx,' but it does not specifically mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, this criterion is not met (0 points).\n\n2. Tender Anterior Cervical Lymphadenopathy: The note states 'posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.' The Centor Score requires 'tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.' Since the lymphadenopathy is described as posterior, this criterion is not met (0 points).\n\n3. Fever > 38.3°C: The patient's temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), which is just below 38.3°C.

 Here is the patient note:
A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a smoking habit who had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia as well as a family history of thoracic aortic dissection presented to a community hospital complaining of sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea. He was diaphoretic, with blood pressure of 114/60mmHg and no pulse deficit, heart rate of 114 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41μg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.
On the basis of the patient’s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ). This test demonstrated an aortic dissection flap confined to the aortic root, superior to the aortic valve and associated with severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful repair of his Stanford type A aortic dissection with a 27mm mechanical valved conduit 21 hours after his initial presentation to the community hospital. The pathology report showed a structurally normal trileaflet native valve and cystic medial necrosis of the wall of the aortic root. Specialist cardiovascular radiologists who reviewed the initial CT scan post hoc reprocessed the raw data and correctly identified the dissection above the aortic valve (Figure ). The dissection flap had initially been misinterpreted as a combination of normal aortic valve apparatus and motion artefact.

Patient is 57 -> age >=50 so fails. So zero criteria met.</think> However, let's go through the patient note step-by-step to check if any of the PERC rule criteria are met. Step 1: List the PERC rule criteria: 1. Age < 50 years 2. No tachypnea (respiratory rate < 20 breaths per minute) 3. No hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≥ 95%) 4. No unilateral leg swelling 5. No prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 6. No hemoptysis 7. No estrogen use 8. No recent surgery or trauma (within the past 4 weeks) 9. No active cancer Step 2: Analyze the given patient note against each criterion: 1. **Age < 50 years**: The patient is 57 years old. This criterion is not met. 2. **No tachypnea (respiratory rate < 20 breaths per minute)**: The patient has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. This criterion is not met because the respiratory rate is exactly 20, which is the cutoff for tachypnea. 3. **No hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≥ 95%)**: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. This implies that the oxygen saturation was below 90% without supplemental oxygen, so this criterion is not met. 4. **No unilateral leg swelling**: There is no mention of leg swelling in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. 5. **No prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: There is no mention of a prior history of VTE in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. 6. **No hemoptysis**: There is no mention of hemoptysis in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. 7. **No estrogen use**: There is no mention of estrogen use in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. 8. **No recent surgery or trauma (within the past 4 weeks)**: There is no mention of recent surgery or trauma in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. 9. **No active cancer**: There is no mention of active cancer in the patient note. Therefore, we cannot say this criterion is met or not met based on the information provided. Let's assume it is not met since it's not mentioned. Since the patient is 57 years old (criterion 1 not met), has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (criterion 2 not met), and has required oxygen to maintain saturation above 90% (indicating oxygen saturation < 95%, criterion 3 not met), we can conclude that at least three criteria are not met.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old male was found unconscious at home by his neighbor and brought to the emergency department by Emergency Medical Services. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on room air. Upon being assessed by the medical staff, there were no immediate signs of trauma or medical alert bracelets. When subjected to a sternal rub, his eyes slightly opened and his limbs were noted to hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement. However, despite repeated attempts, the patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. The initial clinical impression was a possible stroke or major neurological event. Blood tests were run, including coagulation profile, cardiac troponins, glucose, and complete blood count. An urgent CT scan was ordered and he was transferred to the Stroke Unit for further care.

So 2+1+3=6.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the components of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which includes three areas: Eye Opening, Verbal Response, and Motor Response. Step 2: Evaluate the Eye Opening component: - The patient's eyes "slightly opened" in response to a sternal rub. According to the GCS, this corresponds to: - Eye Opening to pain = 2. Step 3: Evaluate the Verbal Response component: - The patient remained nonverbal and not responsive to questions or requests. According to the GCS, this corresponds to: - No verbal response = 1. Step 4: Evaluate the Motor Response component: - The patient's limbs reflexively moved into an extension movement in response to the sternal rub. This suggests a motor response to pain. The description of "hesitatingly reflex into an extension movement" indicates a motor response to pain, which corresponds to: - Extension to pain (decorticate posture) = 3. Now we can calculate the GCS score by adding up the scores from each component: - Eye Opening: 2 - Verbal Response: 1 - Motor Response: 3 So the total GCS score is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 6. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), we need to evaluate three components: Eye Opening, Verbal Response, and Motor Response.\n\n1.

The patient denies history of heart failure, any recent infections or sepsis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy. Prior coagulability workup in the patient revealed elevated serum homocysteine, and was otherwise negative for factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibody. Heparin has been administered throughout the hospitalization with no complications and the patient has no other history of congenital or acquired thrombophilia. The patient's mother had a DVT/PE in her 50's. The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. Physical exam of the lower extremities is notable for a well-healed surgical incision over the left femoral shaft with no signs of infection. There patient has varicose veins bilaterally. There is no lower extremity edema. Range of motion of the left hip and knee are limited due to pain and immobilization.

So total: Age 1 + prior DVT 3 + major surgery 2 + varicose veins 1 = 7. So score 7.</think> Let's calculate the Caprini score step-by-step for this patient. Step 1: Identify the patient's age. The patient is 63 years old. According to the Caprini score, for age 61-74, the score is 1 point. Step 2: Check for a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient has a history of prior DVT. This gives 3 points. Step 3: Check for surgery or trauma. The patient has multiple traumas sustained in a motor vehicle collision, including a left femoral shaft fracture. The femoral shaft fracture likely required surgery. Major surgery (e.g., orthopedic surgery) is worth 2 points. Step 4: Check for immobilization. The patient is confined to bed due to her injuries. Immobilization for more than 72 hours is considered significant. Since she has been confined to bed since the accident and is still in rehabilitation, this likely exceeds 72 hours. Immobilization for more than 72 hours is worth 1 point. Step 5: Check for a history of cancer. The patient has no history of malignancy. This gives 0 points. Step 6: Check for congestive heart failure or chronic respiratory failure. The patient denies history of heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This gives 0 points. Step 7: Check for inflammatory bowel disease or nephrotic syndrome. The patient has no history of inflammatory bowel disease or nephrotic syndrome. This gives 0 points. Step 8: Check for estrogen use. There is no mention of estrogen use. This gives 0 points. Step 9: Check for varicose veins. The patient has varicose veins bilaterally. This gives 1 point. Step 10: Check for obesity. The patient's BMI is 27.1 kg/m^2. Since BMI < 30, this gives 0 points. Now, let's add up the points: - Age 61-74: 1 point - Prior DVT: 3 points - Major surgery (femoral shaft fracture): 2 points - Immobilization > 72 hours: 1 point - Varicose veins: 1 point Total score = 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 points.

Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in milliseconds. The heart rate (HR) is 79 bpm. The formula to calculate the RR interval in milliseconds is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{\text{HR}}. \] Plugging in the heart rate: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60000}{79} \approx 759.49 \, \text{ms}. \] Step 2: Use the Rautaharju formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Rautaharju formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 ms and the RR interval is approximately 759.49 ms, we can plug these values into the formula. First, calculate \(\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}\): \[ \frac{\text{RR}}{1000} = \frac{759.49}{1000} = 0.75949. \] Next, take the square root of this value: \[ \sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}} = \sqrt{0.75949} \approx 0.8714. \] Now, use this result to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.8714} \approx 378.7. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 379 ms. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 379 msec.

Round maybe 507 msec.</think> But let's use the correct formula for the corrected QT interval. The most common formula used is the Bazett's formula, which is QTc = QT / √RR, where RR is the R-R interval in seconds. However, the question seems to be asking for the use of the Hodges formula, which is not a standard formula for calculating the corrected QT interval. The Hodges formula is not widely recognized in the standard literature for QT correction. Let's use the Bazett's formula for the sake of this calculation since it is the most common one. To use Bazett's formula, we need the QT interval and the heart rate to calculate the RR interval. The heart rate (HR) is 161 bpm. The RR interval in seconds can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval (seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate}} = \frac{60}{161} \approx 0.3727 \, \text{seconds}. \] Now we can apply Bazett's formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.3727}}. \] Let's calculate the square root of 0.3727: \[ \sqrt{0.3727} \approx 0.6105. \] Now we can calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6105} \approx 540.6 \, \text{msec}. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 541 msec. However, if we use the Hodges formula as mentioned in the thinking process, the formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \text{QT} + 1.75 \times (\text{HR} - 60). \] Given: - QT = 330 msec, - HR = 161 bpm. Let's plug these values into the Hodges formula: \[ \text{QTc} = 330 + 1.75 \times (161 - 60). \] Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: \[ 161 - 60 = 101. \] Now multiply by 1.75: \[ 1.75 \times 101 = 176.75. \] Add this result to the QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = 330 + 176.75 = 506.75. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 507 msec. So the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is approximately 507 msec. Thus the final answer is 507 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula, we use the formula: QTc = QT + 1.75 * (HR - 60). Given the patient's QT interval is 330 msec and the heart rate is 161 bpm, we plug in the values into the formula.\n\nStep 1: Identify the given values.\n- QT = 330 msec\n- HR = 161 bpm\n\nStep 2: Apply the Hodges formula.\nQTc = 330 + 1.75 * (161 - 60).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the term inside the parenthesis.\n161 - 60 = 101.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the result by 1.75.\n1.75 * 101 = 176.75.\n\nStep 5: Add this result to the QT interval.\nQTc = 330 + 176.75 = 506.75.\n\nStep 6: Round the result to the nearest whole number.\n506.75 rounds to 507.\n\nTherefore, the corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is approximately 507 msec.", "answer": "507"}

 Here is the patient note:
A 65-year-old African American woman was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following an episode of syncope at a community supermarket. She regained consciousness within a few minutes. There was no tongue biting, urinary incontinence, or postictal confusion. She reported some premonitory symptoms of warmth and sweating and gave a history of light-headedness, weakness, and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, dizziness, or visual changes. She denied headache or weakness.
Over the last couple of months, she had multiple episodes of fall but no loss of consciousness. The falls were increasing in frequency over the last 2 weeks. She lived alone and had a history of hypertension for almost thirteen years for which she was noncompliant with her medications. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension and died at the age of 80 years from heart disease.
On examination, her temperature was 37°C, the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure while supine was 89/52 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 52 beats per minute; on standing, her blood pressure fell to 69/40 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
Physical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density. She was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and workup.
Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no obvious lesion. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute with no ST or T wave changes. A 24-hour holter monitoring was performed which revealed sinus bradycardia without other arrhythmias.
Her laboratory studies were as shown in .
Serum alcohol levels were undetectable and urine toxicology was negative. Esophagogastro-dudodenoscopy was performed and the gastric biopsy was suggestive of chronic atrophy of the body and fundus. The endoscopic findings were further reinforced by high serum levels of antibodies to intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells confirming malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to lack of intrinsic factor. Thus, the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was established.
The patient was started on intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) daily for one week, then weekly for one month. She was later lost to followup, and posttreatment evaluation of the skin hyperpigmentation and neurological evaluation could not be done.

Provide answer.</think> To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the given values. - The patient's heart rate (HR) is 72 bpm. - The QT interval is 330 msec. Step 2: Calculate the RR interval in seconds. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and can be calculated as the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute converted to seconds. The formula is: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] Plugging in the given heart rate: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{72} = 0.8333 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 3: Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Bazett formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] We have the QT interval = 330 msec and the RR interval = 0.8333 seconds. Now we need to calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.8333} \approx 0.9128. \] Now, plug the values into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.9128} \approx 361.5. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 362 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 362 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 33-year-old woman was referred to a university hospital for the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea for 4 months. The patient had spontaneous thelarche at age 11 years and menarche at age 13 years. She denied experiencing vasomotor symptoms. A human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test was negative. The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL). Serum levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free T4 were all normal. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().
The patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound. However, follicular development was not observed despite the increase in FSH dose, and cycle cancellation was determined at that time. Further evaluation included karyotype, FMR1 premutation, and 21-hydroxylase antibody tests. The karyotype analysis revealed 47,XXX[1]/46,XX[29]; however, it was read as a normal variant by the specialist in laboratory medicine. The FMR1 premutation test revealed no abnormal CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The patient tested negative for 21-hydroxylase antibodies. In addition, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. She was prescribed oral contraceptives (Yaz®) for hypoestrogenism associated with POI.

The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL).

A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus with polycystic ovarian morphology (> 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm) observed in the right ovary ().\nThe patient was unmarried and wanted to preserve her fertility; therefore, she was advised to visit an infertility hospital for oocyte cryopreservation. The repeated basal hormonal tests were unchanged, and serum levels of androgens including total testosterone, free testosterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were all normal. Induction of superovulation was attempted with a starting dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (Follitrope®; LG, Iksan, Korea) daily for oocyte cryopreservation. The dose of recombinant FSH was increased to 225 IU after one week because follicular development was not observed on ultrasound.

 Here is the patient note:
A 28-year-old man presented with severe neck pain mainly on the left side with painful swallowing for 5 days. The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.
On examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.
The bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days). Then, he was discharged with a scheduled followup appointment after 7 days. On the followup visit, the patient was completely improved with disappearance of the constitutional symptoms, no pain or tenderness on the neck and normal swallowing function.

So score 5.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the components of the FeverPAIN score: - Fever (temperature > 38°C) - Pain - Earache - Age < 15 years - No cough - Duration > 3 days Step 2: Evaluate each component based on the given patient note. 1. **Fever**: The patient has a "low-grade fever." A low-grade fever typically means a temperature above normal but below 38°C. Since the FeverPAIN score requires a fever > 38°C to count as a point, this likely does not count. However, if we interpret "low-grade fever" as a mild elevation that could be just above normal but not necessarily >38°C, it might not count. Let's assume it doesn't count for the FeverPAIN score. 2. **Pain**: The patient has severe neck pain. This counts as 1 point. 3. **Earache**: There is no mention of earache. So, this is 0 points. 4. **Age < 15 years**: The patient is 28 years old. Since the patient is over 15 years old, this does not count. However, the FeverPAIN score for adults over 15 years old assigns 1 point for being over 15 years old. 5. **No cough**: The patient had an episode of choking and coughing while eating chicken, but there's no mention of a current cough. Therefore, we can assume there is no current cough, which counts as 1 point. 6. **Duration > 3 days**: The patient has had symptoms for 5 days. Since the duration is more than 3 days, this counts as 1 point. Now let's tally up the points: - Fever (temperature > 38°C): 0 (since it's a low-grade fever, likely not >38°C) - Pain: 1 (severe neck pain) - Earache: 0 (no earache mentioned) - Age < 15 years: 0 (since the patient is 28 years old, but for over 15 years old, it counts as 1 point) - No cough: 1 (no current cough) - Duration > 3 days: 1 (symptoms for 5 days) Since the patient is over 15 years old, we add 1 point for the age component. So the total score is: - Pain: 1 - No cough: 1 - Duration > 3 days: 1 - Age > 15: 1 Total = 1 (Pain) + 1 (No cough) + 1 (Duration > 3 days) + 1 (Age > 15) = 4 points. However, the FeverPAIN score for adults over 15 years old is calculated differently from the pediatric version. The FeverPAIN score for adults over 15 years old includes the following components: - Fever (temperature > 38°C): 0 (low-grade fever, likely not >38°C) - Pain: 1 (severe neck pain) - No cough: 1 (no current cough) - Duration > 3 days: 1 (symptoms for 5 days) If we use the FeverPAIN score for adults over 15 years old, the score is: Fever (temperature > 38°C): 0 Pain: 1 No cough: 1 Duration > 3 days: 1 Total = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 But since the FeverPAIN score for adults over 15 years old also includes the age component (which is automatically 1 point for being over 15), the total score becomes: Total = 1 (for age > 15) + 1 (Pain) + 1 (No cough) + 1 (Duration > 3 days) = 4 Thus the FeverPAIN score is 4. So the FeverPAIN score is 4. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the FeverPAIN score for this patient, we need to evaluate the following components: Fever (temperature > 38°C), Pain, Earache, Age < 15 years, No cough, and Duration > 3 days. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Fever**: The patient has a low-grade fever. A low-grade fever typically means a temperature above normal but below 38°C. Since the FeverPAIN score requires a fever > 38°C to count as a point, this likely does not count. So, Fever = 0.\n\n2. **Pain**: The patient has severe neck pain. This counts as 1 point. So, Pain = 1.\n\n3. **Earache**: There is no mention of earache. So, Earache = 0.\n\n4. **Age < 15 years**: The patient is 28 years old, so this does not apply. For patients over 15 years old, the FeverPAIN score includes a point for being over 15 years old. So, Age > 15 = 1.\n\n5. **No cough**: The patient had an episode of choking and coughing while eating chicken, but there's no mention of a current cough. Therefore, we can assume there is no current cough, which counts as 1 point. So, No cough = 1.\n\n6. **Duration > 3 days**: The patient has had symptoms for 5 days. Since the duration is more than 3 days, this counts as 1 point. So, Duration > 3 days = 1.\n\nNow, let's sum up the points:\n- Fever: 0\n- Pain: 1\n- No cough: 1\n- Duration > 3 days: 1\n- Age > 15: 1\n\nTotal score = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the FeverPAIN score is 4.", "answer": "4"}

The patient initially had asked for medical advice at a primary health care facility and was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but there was no improvement and the pain was increasing in severity. On detailed history, the patient reported that he had an attack of choking and coughing, while he was eating chicken during dinner one day before the onset of symptoms.\nOn examination, there was a low-grade fever and tenderness in the left side of the neck, and the pain was exaggerated by swallowing attempts. A telescopic laryngeal examination was performed. Frothy saliva was detected accumulating in the left pyriform fossa. After giving the patient some few sips of water, the examination was repeated. A white linear chicken bone was seen impacted at the left pyriform fossa with a relatively free broad base pointing anteriorly, and the other tapering end was impacted in the posterior wall of the pyriform fossa (). To rule out development of a retropharyngeal abscess, anteroposterior and lateral X-ray views of the neck were performed for the patient. Apart from the chicken bone that was poorly visualized in the lateral X-ray view of the neck, there was no evidence of retropharyngeal abscess formation.\nThe bone was removed in an office-based setting under guidance of video laryngeal rigid telescopic examination. In this procedure, a video laryngeal examination was carried out using a 70-degree rigid telescope, 3CCD camera, LCD monitor, and a light source. The patient was seated in the upright position with his head supported from the back. Using a cotton swab soaked with Xylocaine 10% and held by a Magill's forceps, the patient's oro- and hypopharynx were adequately anesthetized. The patient was instructed to protrude his tongue and hold it by his hand with a piece of gauze. The telescope was held by the physician's left hand and introduced carefully into the oropharynx. When the foreign body was identified in the left pyriform fossa and clearly visualized on the monitor, it was carefully removed by a curved laryngeal forceps held by the right hand of the physician (). After that, the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics in the form of Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid (1 gm b.i.d. for 10 days) to control possible infection and an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug in the form of Diclofenac Sodium (50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days).

So answer (29 weeks, 3 days).</think> To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP), which is 07/18/2010, and today's date, which is 02/09/2011. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between 07/18/2010 and 02/09/2011. From July 18, 2010, to July 31, 2010: - Days remaining in July 2010 = 31 - 18 = 13 days. Now, we add the number of days in each subsequent month until February 9, 2011. August 2010: 31 days September 2010: 30 days October 2010: 31 days November 2010: 30 days December 2010: 31 days January 2011: 31 days February 2011: 9 days (up to February 9, 2011). Now, sum up all these days: \[ \text{Total days} = 13 (\text{July}) + 31 (\text{August}) + 30 (\text{September}) + 31 (\text{October}) + 30 (\text{November}) + 31 (\text{December}) + 31 (\text{January}) + 9 (\text{February}) \] Let's add them step by step: \[ 13 + 31 = 44 \] \[ 44 + 30 = 74 \] \[ 74 + 31 = 105 \] \[ 105 + 30 = 135 \] \[ 135 + 31 = 166 \] \[ 166 + 31 = 197 \] \[ 197 + 9 = 206 \] So, the total number of days between July 18, 2010, and February 9, 2011, is 206 days. Next, we convert these 206 days into weeks and days. Since there are 7 days in a week: \[ \text{Number of weeks} = \left\lfloor \frac{206}{7} \right\rfloor \] \[ \text{Number of weeks} = \left\lfloor 29.4286 \right\rfloor = 29 \] To find the number of remaining days: \[ \text{Remaining days} = 206 - (29 \times 7) \] \[ 29 \times 7 = 203 \] \[ \text{Remaining days} = 206 - 203 = 3 \] Therefore, the gestational age is 29 weeks and 3 days. The answer is (29 weeks, 3 days). So the final JSON output is: {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the gestational age, we need to find the number of days between the last menstrual period (LMP), which is 07/18/2010, and today's date, which is 02/09/2011.

 Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.
He reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse. The patient was adopted at the age of 6 when he immigrated from Mexico to the United States; hence, substantial medical history of his biological family could not be obtained.
On arrival, the patient was afebrile with temperature of 98.7°F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, elevated BP of 175/99 mm Hg, 100% oxygen saturation at room air, and BMI of 27.12 kg/m². Systolic BP in his previous outpatient visits ranged from 140 to 180 mm Hg, indicative of poorly controlled BP. On physical examination, the patient appeared well built but he was pale and lethargic. He had a scab on his upper lip and on removal of the scab, slow oozing of blood was noted. Rest of his examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological showed no abnormalities. Blood chemistry revealed serum sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 5.0 mmol/L, chloride of 98 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, anion gap of 30 mmol/L, serum phosphorus of 11.7 mg/dL, corrected calcium of 7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 228 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of >37 mg/dL (Architect Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA, alkaline picrate kinetic [AP-K] method) []. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unmeasurable and therefore not reported. The calculated GFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was less than 1.5 mL/minute/1.73 m². His baseline creatinine was around 2.9 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 4.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, mean corpuscular volume of 87.3 fL, and platelet count of 127 x 103/mcL. Peripheral smear showed poikilocytosis, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 1,008 pg/mL. Uric acid levels and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated at 16.5 mg/dL and 353 U/L, respectively. Protime was mildly elevated to 15.2 seconds, with an unremarkable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. On gross inspection, the urine sample was pale yellow and cloudy in appearance. The urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.012, with pH of 5.0, two plus proteinuria, two plus blood, three plus white blood cell esterase, and positive for leukocytes and red blood cells. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU/mL). Serological work-up including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibodies and hepatitis B core IgM antibody, and urine drug screen were all negative.
Chest X-ray did not show any signs of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Figure ). Electrocardiogram showed prolonged QT (QTc 493 ms) (Figure ) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Renal ultrasound reported bilaterally increased parenchymal echogenicity and cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal insufficiency (Figure ).
The patient emergently underwent transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells. HTN was controlled with amlodipine and intravenous hydralazine. His metabolic acidosis was slowly corrected with intravenous bicarbonate infusion. An internal jugular venous hemodialysis catheter was placed, and the patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. With initiation of hemodialysis, bleeding and electrolyte imbalances resolved. During his hospital course, he was also treated with a five-day course of ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection. At discharge, his creatinine level had come down to 15.1 mg/dL, BUN was down to 56 mg/dL, potassium was down to 3.9 mmol/L and hemoglobin was 7.5 g/dL. Eventually, the patient was transitioned to peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, due to the patient's non-compliance with dialysis, he has been admitted multiple times over the past year with similar presentations.

Here is the patient note:
A 27-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of obesity (BMI: 28.59 kg/m²), long-standing uncontrolled HTN, stage 3 CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, generalized weakness, and bleeding from the upper lip. Approximately a week ago, he got a cut on his lip while drinking from an open can and since then was suffering from slow oozing of blood from the wound site. He also reported 25-30 pounds unintentional weight loss over the past two months. He denied dysuria, hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, abdominal pain, diaphoresis, fever, chills, syncopal attacks, palpitations, headache, blurry vision, dyspnea, or lower extremity swelling.
The patient was diagnosed with HTN at the age of 13. Three years ago, he was evaluated for exertional chest pain and uncontrolled HTN, which led to the diagnosis of CKD stage III/IV with a baseline creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL. Cortisol level was normal, aldosterone level was less than 1 ng/dL, and renin activity level was elevated at 24.40 ng/mL/hour, but the patient was on lisinopril and repeat testing after discontinuing lisinopril was normal at 1.4 ng/mL/hour. Vasculitis work-up including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) screen, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, and C3 and C4 complement levels were all within the normal range. Renal artery duplex had shown no signs of renal artery stenosis, and CT of the chest had shown a 3.7 cm (borderline) ascending thoracic aorta but no signs of coarctation. Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.

Therefore, the delta gap is 3 mEq/L.', 'Ground Truth Answer': '18', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 30.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 30.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 30.0 - 12 = 18.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 18.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 50%|█████     | 50/100 [45:31<40:49, 48.98s/it]

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU following an episode of respiratory distress. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease. A reduction in her mental status is noted with a Glasgow Coma Score recently read as 13. She is currently on CPAP, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) set at 54 %, resulting in a recorded partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) at 77 mm Hg. Despite her concerning condition, her blood pressure remained stable, at 120 and 80 mm Hg on multiple vasopressors: DOPamine and DOBUTamine at 4 mcg/kg/min and 3.5 mcg/kg/min, respectively, and norEPINEPHrine, along with EPINEPHrine presides at 0.07 mcg/kg/min and 0.03 mcg/kg/min respectively. Serum chemistry reports show a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and bilirubin levels at 1.7 mg/dL, possible evidence of mild renal dysfunction and liver abnormalities respectively. Platelets were measured to total 180,000/µL, a typical value. Her urine output represented a somewhat regular fluid balance, documented at 925 mL/day. Continuous monitoring of her organ function and judicious intervention is warranted based on her specific health scenario.

The blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. - MAP = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3 = (2 * 80 + 120) / 3 = (160 + 120) / 3 = 280 / 3 ≈ 93.3 mm Hg. - Since the MAP is 93.3 mm Hg, which is >70 mm Hg, we need to look at the vasopressor support to determine the score. - The SOFA scoring for the cardiovascular system is based on both MAP and vasopressor use: - If MAP > 70 mm Hg and no vasopressors: 0 points - If MAP > 70 mm Hg and vasopressors required to maintain MAP: 1 point if vasopressors required to maintain MAP > 70 mm Hg - If 70 mm Hg ≥ MAP > 50 mm Hg and vasopressors required: 2 points - If MAP ≤ 50 mm Hg: 3 points - If vasopressors required to maintain MAP > 70 mm Hg, the score is 1 point. - Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors (DOPamine, DOBUTamine, norEPINEPHrine, and EPINEPHrine), and the MAP is >70 mm Hg, the score is 1 point for the use of vasopressors. 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.9 mg/dL - The SOFA scoring for creatinine is as follows: - <1.2: 0 points - 1.2-1.9: 1 point - 2.0-3.4: 2 points - 3.5-4.9: 3 points - ≥5: 4 points - Since the creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, which falls within the range 1.2-1.9, the score is 1 point. 6. **CNS (Glasgow Coma Score):** - GCS = 13 - The SOFA scoring for the CNS is based on the GCS: - GCS 15: 0 points - GCS 13-14: 1 point - GCS 10-12: 2 points - GCS 6-9: 3 points - GCS <6: 4 points - Since the GCS is 13, the score is 1 point. Now, let's sum up all the scores from each component: - Respiratory: 3 points - Hematologic: 0 points - Liver: 1 point - Cardiovascular: 1 point (for vasopressor use) - Renal: 1 point - CNS: 1 point Total SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 points. So the total SOFA score is 7.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '4', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's current SOFA score is 0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 77.0 mm Hg and FiO₂ percentage is 54.0 %. This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is 1.426. Whether the patient is on mechanical ventillation is not reported and so we assume this to be false. The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. For two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 13 and 14, we add 1 point to the score, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.7 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, make the current score 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 180000.0 count/µL. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10³/µL, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 4.\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 4 points.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.
Lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.

Step 1: Identify the Centor Score criteria: - Tonsillar exudates - Tenderness of the anterior cervical lymph nodes - Absence of cough - Fever (measured or reported) - Age (under 15 years old or over 45 years old) Step 2: Evaluate each criterion based on the patient note: 1. Tonsillar Exudates: The note mentions "Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall." This indicates the presence of lymphoid follicles but does not explicitly mention tonsillar exudates. Therefore, we cannot count this as a positive for tonsillar exudates. 2. Tenderness of the Anterior Cervical Lymph Nodes: There is no mention of any lymph node tenderness in the patient note. 3. Absence of Cough: The patient presented with a cough, so this criterion is not met. 4. Fever: The patient had a fever (39°C), so this criterion is met. 5. Age: The patient is 16 years old. The age criterion for the Centor score is either under 15 years old or over 45 years old. Since the patient is 16 years old, this criterion is not met. Now let's count the positive criteria: - Tonsillar exudates: No - Tenderness of the anterior cervical lymph nodes: No - Absence of cough: No - Fever: Yes - Age (under 15 or over 45): No So, the only positive criterion is "Fever." Therefore, the Centor Score is 1 (for the presence of fever). {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Centor Score, we need to evaluate the following criteria: tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, absence of cough, fever, and age (under 15 or over 45 years old).

 Here is the patient note:
Near midday an 87-year-old woman activated 911 complaining of shortness of breath. The patient’s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.
The initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).
In the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.
En route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of “being sleepy” but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient’s mental status changed abruptly. She became non-verbal, her eyes remained open with a fixed gaze, but she was able to flex her hands on command.
Upon arrival to our ED the patient’s vitals signs were: heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 per minute, blood pressure 135/65, tympanic temperature 96.4°F, and oxygen saturation 92% on 15-liter flow nonrebreather mask. Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient’s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient’s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.
Initial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels. Laboratory values drawn 19 minutes after arrival at our facility were as follows: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 19 mg/dL, glucose 164 mg/dL, Mg 1.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.8 mg/dL, ionized calcium 1.10 mmol/L (reference 1.17–1.33 mmol/L). Cardiac enzymes, creatinine kinase (CK), CKMB and Troponin-T were normal. The initial arterial blood gas obtained on room air showed a pH of 7.28; the pCO2 was 44 mmHg, pO2 63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 87%. The serum lidocaine level drawn 51 minutes after arrival, 30 minutes after the lidocaine drip was discontinued, resulted 7.9 mg/L with a reference range in our laboratory of 1.5–6.0 mg/L.
Following termination of the lidocaine drip the patient’s mental status gradually and steadily improved. By 60 minutes after termination of the drip her NIH stroke scale score was three, indicative of minimal impairment. During the ensuing hospitalization no more abnormalities of mental status or other neurologic complaints were encountered.

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department following an acute abdominal pain that started suddenly 8 hours ago. He has a known history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, for which he takes insulin daily, and liver cirrhosis. The patient denies any history of cerebrovascular events or ischemic heart disease. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 138/92 mmHg, heart rate is 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and he is afebrile with a temperature of 37.2°C. Auscultation of the chest reveals no rales, S3 gallop, or signs of congestive heart failure. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 15, indicating full consciousness. Laboratory results show a creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function, and a sodium level of 143.21 mmol/L and a potassium level of 3.68 mmol/L. His fraction of inspired air is 63 %.  His arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.29, a PaO2 of 78 mm Hg, and an A-a gradient of 331 mm Hg while on room air. Hematocrit is at 41 %, and white blood cell count is 15,105 cells/µL. Given his acute presentation, history of diabetes managed with insulin, and laboratory findings, a thorough evaluation including imaging and further laboratory tests is warranted to assess the severity and underlying cause of his symptoms.

Hematocrit 0. So 24.</think> However, let's calculate step by step systematically. 1. **Age**: 73 years old. The APACHE II scoring for age is as follows: - 71-80 years: 5 points. - So, age = 5 points. 2. **Temperature**: 37.2°C. The APACHE II scoring for temperature is: - 34-36°C: 1 point. - 37-38.9°C: 0 points. - >39°C: 1 point. - Since 37.2°C falls within the range 37-38.9°C, temperature = 0 points. 3. **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: To calculate MAP, we use the formula: MAP = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3. - Systolic = 138 mmHg, Diastolic = 92 mmHg. - MAP = (2 * 92 + 138) / 3 = (184 + 138) / 3 = 322 / 3 = 107.3 mmHg. - The APACHE II scoring for MAP is: - <70 mmHg: 4 points. - 70-79 mmHg: 3 points. - 80-89 mmHg: 2 points. - 90-109 mmHg: 0 points. - >109 mmHg: 1 point. - Since MAP = 107.3 mmHg falls within the range 90-109 mmHg, MAP = 0 points. 4. **Heart Rate (HR)**: 107 beats per minute. - The APACHE II scoring for HR is: - <40 bpm: 3 points. - 40-49 bpm: 2 points. - 50-89 bpm: 0 points. - 90-109 bpm: 1 point. - 110-129 bpm: 2 points. - >130 bpm: 3 points. - Since HR = 107 bpm falls within the range 90-109 bpm, HR = 1 point. 5. **Respiratory Rate (RR)**: 35 breaths per minute. - The APACHE II scoring for RR is: - <10 breaths/min: 3 points. - 10-14 breaths/min: 1 point. - 15-29 breaths/min: 0 points. - 30-39 breaths/min: 1 point. - >40 breaths/min: 2 points. - Since RR = 35 breaths/min falls within the range 30-39 breaths/min, RR = 1 point. 6. **PaO2/FiO2 Ratio**: PaO2 = 78 mmHg, FiO2 = 0.63. - PaO2/FiO2 = 78 / 0.63 ≈ 123.81. - The APACHE II scoring for PaO2/FiO2 is: - >300: 0 points. - 200-300: 1 point. - 100-199: 2 points. - 50-99: 3 points. - <50: 4 points. - Since PaO2/FiO2 = 123.81 falls within the range 100-199, PaO2/FiO2 = 2 points. 7. **Serum Sodium**: 143.21 mmol/L. - The APACHE II scoring for serum sodium is: - <120 mmol/L: 4 points. - 120-129 mmol/L: 3 points. - 130-154 mmol/L: 0 points. - >155 mmol/L: 1 point. - Since serum sodium = 143.21 mmol/L falls within the range 130-154 mmol/L, serum sodium = 0 points. 8. **Serum Potassium**: 3.68 mmol/L. - The APACHE II scoring for serum potassium is: - <3.0 mmol/L: 2 points. - 3.0-3.4 mmol/L: 1 point. - 3.5-5.4 mmol/L: 0 points. - >5.5 mmol/L: 1 point. - Since serum potassium = 3.68 mmol/L falls within the range 3.5-5.4 mmol/L, serum potassium = 0 points. 9. **Serum Creatinine**: 4.58 mg/dL. - The APACHE II scoring for serum creatinine is: - <1.2 mg/dL: 0 points. - 1.2-1.9 mg/dL: 1 point. - 2.0-2.9 mg/dL: 2 points. - 3.0-4.9 mg/dL: 3 points. - >5.0 mg/dL: 4 points. - Since serum creatinine = 4.58 mg/dL falls within the range 3.0-4.9 mg/dL, serum creatinine = 3 points. 10. **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**: 15,105 cells/µL (or 15.1 x 10^9/L). - The APACHE II scoring for WBC is: - <4 x 10^9/L: 1 point. - 4-7 x 10^9/L: 0 points. - 7-10 x 10^9/L: 0 points. - 10-20 x 10^9/L: 1 point. - >20 x 10^9/L: 2 points. - Since WBC = 15.1 x 10^9/L falls within the range 10-20 x 10^9/L, WBC = 1 point. 11. **Hematocrit**: 41%. - The APACHE II scoring for hematocrit is: - <20%: 3 points. - 20-29.9%: 2 points. - 30-44.9%: 0 points. - 45-59.9%: 0 points. - >60%: 1 point. - Since hematocrit = 41%, it falls within the range 30-44.9%, so hematocrit = 0 points. 12. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: 15. - The APACHE II scoring for GCS is: - 15: 0 points. - 13-14: 1 point. - 10-12: 2 points. - 5-9: 3 points. - <5: 4 points. - Since GCS = 15, GCS = 0 points. Now, we sum up the points from the physiological parameters: - Age: 5 points. - Temperature: 0 points. - MAP: 0 points. - HR: 1 point. - RR: 1 point. - PaO2/FiO2: 2 points. - Serum Sodium: 0 points. - Serum Potassium: 0 points. - Serum Creatinine: 3 points. - WBC: 1 point. - Hematocrit: 0 points. - GCS: 0 points. Total from physiological parameters = 5 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 13 points. Now, we add the chronic health points: The patient has liver cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes managed with insulin. - Liver cirrhosis: 4 points. - Diabetes managed with insulin: 1 point. However, the APACHE II scoring system assigns chronic health points as follows: - Chronic health conditions: - Liver disease (cirrhosis): 4 points. - Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin: 1 point. So the total chronic health points = 4 (for liver cirrhosis) + 1 (for diabetes requiring insulin) = 5 points. Adding the chronic health points to the total from physiological parameters: Total APACHE II score = 13 (physiological parameters) + 5 (chronic health points) = 18. Thus the final APACHE II score is 18. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the APACHE II score for the patient, we need to evaluate several physiological parameters and add the chronic health points.

Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 63.0 %. Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 331.0. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 200 and 349, we add 2 points to the total, making the current total 7.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 7 + 4 = 11.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

 Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old gentleman presents with episodes of dizziness and palpitations. His past medical history is significant for a previous stroke and uncontrolled hypertension (182/111). Blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80 % of the time. A significant bleeding event that happened following a minor operative procedure is documented and requires careful attention. His lifestyle habits include moderate alcohol consumption, tallying approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. Despite the other complexities, the liver function tests appear normal suggesting no liver disease, and similar is the case with his renal function tests showing no kidney impairment. His case is closely following up considering all the clinically important traits.

Here is the task:

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to calculate HAS-BLED score. Factors: Hypertension (uncontrolled >160/100) = 1. Abnormal renal/liver function (none). Stroke history = 1. Bleeding history or predisposition (significant bleeding event) = 1. Labile INR = 1. Age >65? patient 59, so 0. Drugs/alcohol: moderate alcohol 3 drinks/week, not heavy, so 0. So total 1+1+1+1=4.

Here is the patient note:
A 59-year-old gentleman presents with episodes of dizziness and palpitations. His past medical history is significant for a previous stroke and uncontrolled hypertension (182/111). Blood tests showed a labile INR, with a supra-therapeutic range nearly 80 % of the time. A significant bleeding event that happened following a minor operative procedure is documented and requires careful attention. His lifestyle habits include moderate alcohol consumption, tallying approximately three alcoholic beverages per week. Despite the other complexities, the liver function tests appear normal suggesting no liver disease, and similar is the case with his renal function tests showing no kidney impairment. His case is closely following up considering all the clinically important traits.

The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in seconds. \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} = \frac{60}{170} \approx 0.3529 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Fridericia formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Fridericia formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc} = \text{QT} / \sqrt[3]{\text{RR}}. \] We have the QT interval = 330 msec and the RR interval = 0.3529 seconds. Now, we need to calculate the cube root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt[3]{\text{RR}} = \sqrt[3]{0.3529}. \] Using a calculator to find the cube root of 0.3529: \[ \sqrt[3]{0.3529} \approx 0.7066. \] Now, plug this value into the Fridericia formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.7066} \approx 466.99. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 467 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

A 55-year-old right-handed male presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He was teaching a karate class when a coworker saw him fall to the ground. He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.
He had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.
The patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).
Cardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.

Score = 0. - **Hypertension (H):** The patient note does not mention hypertension. Score = 0. - **Age ≥75 years (A2):** The patient is 55 years old, which is not ≥75 years. Score = 0. - **Diabetes (D):** The patient note does not mention diabetes. Score = 0. - **Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (S2):** The patient note does not mention any history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism. Score = 0. - **Vascular disease (V):** The patient note does not mention any vascular disease. Score = 0. - **Age 65-74 years (A):** The patient is 55 years old, which is not within the age range of 65-74 years. Score = 0. - **Sex category (female) (Sc):** The patient is male. Therefore, this component does not apply. Score = 0.

So 40.2/17.1=2.35 mg/dL. Score: 2 mg/dL = 2 points? Actually ranges: <1.2 mg/dL = 1, 1.2-2.0 = 2, >2.0 = 3. So 2.35 >2 => 3 points. Albumin 3.1 g/dL: ranges: >3.5 =1, 2.8-3.5=2, <2.8=3. So 3.1 => 2 points. INR 2.1: ranges: <1.7=1, 1.7-2.3=2, >2.3=3. So 2.1 => 2 points. Ascites: negative (none) => 1 point. Encephalopathy: asterixis present, confusion, so grade II? But any encephalopathy = 2 points? Actually Child-Pugh: encephalopathy: none=1, grade I-II=2, grade III-IV=3. So 2 points. Total: 3+2+2+1+2=10. That is Class B (7-9) or C?

Return JSON.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. Bilirubin: The given value is 40.2 umol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 17.1 umol/L. Therefore, 40.2 umol/L / 17.1 = 2.35 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification for bilirubin:\n- <1.2 mg/dL = 1 point\n- 1.2 - 2.0 mg/dL = 2 points\n- >2.0 mg/dL = 3 points.\nSince 2.35 mg/dL is greater than 2.0 mg/dL, the score for bilirubin is 3 points.\n\n2. Albumin: The given value is 3.1 g/dL. The scoring for albumin is as follows:\n- >3.5 g/dL = 1 point\n- 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL = 2 points\n- <2.8 g/dL = 3 points.\nSince 3.1 g/dL falls within the range of 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL, the score for albumin is 2 points.\n\n3. INR: The given value is 2.1. The scoring for INR is as follows:\n- <1.7 = 1 point\n- 1.7 - 2.3 = 2 points\n- >2.3 = 3 points.\nSince 2.1 falls within the range of 1.7 - 2.3, the score for INR is 2 points.\n\n4. Ascites: The patient's abdominal exam is negative for ascites. The scoring for ascites is as follows:\n- None = 1 point\n- Controlled medically = 2 points\n- Difficult to control = 3 points.\nSince the patient has no ascites, the score for ascites is 1 point.\n\n5.

Output the score only.\\n', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '10', 'Target Explanation': "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy. Let's break this down step by step.\\n\\n1. Bilirubin: The given value is 40.2 umol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 17.1 umol/L. Therefore, 40.2 umol/L / 17.1 = 2.35 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification for bilirubin:\\n- <1.2 mg/dL = 1 point\\n- 1.2 - 2.0 mg/dL = 2 points\\n- >2.0 mg/dL = 3 points.\\nSince 2.35 mg/dL is greater than 2.0 mg/dL, the score for bilirubin is 3 points.\\n\\n2. Albumin: The given value is 3.1 g/dL. The scoring for albumin is as follows:\\n- >3.5 g/dL = 1 point\\n- 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL = 2 points\\n- <2.8 g/dL = 3 points.\\nSince 3.1 g/dL falls within the range of 2.8 - 3.5 g/dL, the score for albumin is 2 points.\\n\\n3. INR: The given value is 2.1. The scoring for INR is as follows:\\n- <1.7 = 1 point\\n- 1.7 - 2.3 = 2 points\\n- >2.3 = 3 points.\\nSince 2.1 falls within the range of 1.7 - 2.3, the score for INR is 2 points.\\n\\n4. Ascites: The patient's abdominal exam is negative for ascites. The scoring for ascites is as follows:\\n- None = 1 point\\n- Controlled medically = 2 points\\n- Difficult to control = 3 points.\\nSince the patient has no ascites, the score for ascites is 1 point.\\n\\n5. Encephalopathy: The patient is oriented only to self, has asterixis, and is confused. This indicates the presence of encephalopathy. The scoring for encephalopathy is as follows:\\n- None = 1 point\\n- Grade I-II = 2 points\\n- Grade III-IV = 3 points.\\nSince the patient has some level of encephalopathy (confusion and asterixis), it suggests at least Grade I-II encephalopathy. Therefore, the score for encephalopathy is 2 points.\\n\\nNow, we sum up the scores from each parameter:\\n- Bilirubin: 3 points\\n- Albumin: 2 points\\n- INR: 2 points\\n- Ascites: 1 point\\n- Encephalopathy: 2 points.\\n\\nAdding these together: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10.\\n\\nThe Child-Pugh score is 10. According to the Child-Pugh classification:\\n- Class A: 5-6 points\\n- Class B: 7-9 points\\n- Class C: 10-15 points.\\nSince the total score is 10, the patient falls into Class C.\\n\\nThe Child-Pugh score is 10.", 'Ground Truth Answer': '8', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current child pugh score is 0.\nThe patient's INR is 2.1. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from µmol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 µmol. To convert 40.2 µmol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 µmol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 µmol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.1 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\nEncephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe patient's child pugh score is 8.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with febrile sensation and cough for 3 days. He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5℃. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.
Chest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.
After three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.
Percutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.

Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm×2.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of β2-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL. On bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, plasma cells were increased up to 7.8% of all marrow nucleated cells. Those findings were consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and insufficient for diagnostic criteria of symptomatic multiple myeloma. The patient was finally diagnosed as a posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma (IgG-kappa type). The patient was referred to the hematology department for proper treatment. This report was approved by the Ethical Review Committee.', 'Question': 'What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?', 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': '1', 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'We need to count SIRS criteria met. SIRS criteria: temperature >38 or <36; heart rate >90; respiratory rate >20 or PaCO2 <32; WBC >12k or <4k or >10% bands. Patient: temp 38.5 >38 yes. HR 68 <90 no. RR 20 equals 20? criterion is >20, so not met. WBC 8000 normal, no. So only 1 criterion.', 'LLM Explanation': 'SIRS criteria are: 1) Temperature >38°C or <36°C – the patient has 38.5°C, so this criterion is met. 2) Heart rate >90/min – the patient’s HR is 68/min, so not met. 3) Respiratory rate >20/min or PaCO₂ <32 mmHg – the patient’s RR is 20/min (not >20) and PaCO₂ is 36.3 mmHg, so not met. 4) White blood cell count >12,000/mm³ or <4,000/mm³ or >10% bands – the patient’s WBC is 8,000/mm³ with normal differential, so not met. Thus only one SIRS criterion is satisfied.', 'Target Model': 'BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B', 'Target Answer': '1', 'Target Explanation': "To determine the number of SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria met by the patient, we need to check the following four criteria:\\n1. Temperature >38°C or <36°C.\\n2. Heart rate >90 beats per minute.\\n3. Respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg.\\n4. White blood cell count >12,000/mm³ or <4,000/mm³ or >10% bands.\\n\\nLet's evaluate each criterion based on the given patient data:\\n\\n1. Temperature: The patient's body temperature is 38.5°C. Since 38.5°C > 38°C, this criterion is met.\\n\\n2. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is 68 beats per minute. Since 68 beats per minute is not greater than 90 beats per minute, this criterion is not met.\\n\\n3. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. The criterion requires the respiratory rate to be >20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg. The respiratory rate is exactly 20, which does not meet the criterion of being >20. We also need to check the PaCO2 value from the arterial blood gas analysis. The PaCO2 is 36.3 mm Hg, which is not less than 32 mm Hg. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\\n\\n4. White blood cell count: The patient's white blood cell count is 8,000/mm³. This value is within the range of 4,000-12,000/mm³, and there is no information about the presence of bands. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\\n\\nIn summary, out of the four SIRS criteria, only one criterion (temperature >38°C) is met.\\n", 'Ground Truth Answer': '2', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's heart rate is 68.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8000.0 count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per m^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 20.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is 36.3 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'}

Step 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME. The patient takes a 60 mg Fentanyl patch once a day. The conversion factor for Fentanyl patches is typically 1 mg of Fentanyl = 100 MME. Therefore, a 60 mg Fentanyl patch would be: \[ 60 \, \text{mg} \times 100 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 6000 \, \text{MME}. \] Step 2: Convert the Hydrocodone dose to MME. The patient takes 20 mg of Hydrocodone 3 times a day. The total daily dose of Hydrocodone is: \[ 20 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 3 \, \text{doses/day} = 60 \, \text{mg/day}. \] The conversion factor for Hydrocodone is 1 mg of Hydrocodone = 4 MME. Therefore, the MME for the Hydrocodone is: \[ 60 \, \text{mg} \times 4 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 240 \, \text{MME}. \] Step 3: Convert the Fentanyl buccal dose to MME. The patient takes 30 mg of Fentanyl buccal 2 times a day. The total daily dose of Fentanyl buccal is: \[ 30 \, \text{mg/dose} \times 2 \, \text{doses/day} = 60 \, \text{mg/day}. \] The conversion factor for Fentanyl buccal is typically 1 mg of Fentanyl buccal = 100 MME. Therefore, the MME for the Fentanyl buccal is: \[ 60 \, \text{mg} \times 100 \, \text{(MME/mg)} = 6000 \, \text{MME}. \] Step 4: Add up all the MME from each medication to get the total daily MME. \[ \text{Total MME} = 6000 \, \text{(from Fentanyl patch)} + 240 \, \text{(from Hydrocodone)} + 6000 \, \text{(from Fentanyl buccal)} = 12240 \, \text{MME}. \] So the total daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) for the patient is 12240. The final answer is 12240. {"step_by_step_thinking": "Step 1: Convert the Fentanyl patch dose to MME. The patient takes a 60 mg Fentanyl patch once a day.

 Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness. Review of systems were remarkable for foul-smelling urine with associated, intermittent LLQ pain. He reported nausea without vomiting. Of note, he denied recent travel and change in dietary habits. He has not been sexually active for the past year and he had an index colonoscopy in 2004.
On exam in the ER, his BP was 121/79, pulse 111, temp. 101.7°F, respiratory rate (RR) 19, saturating at 95% on room air. His mucous membranes were dry, abdomen was tender in RUQ. Chest was clear and rectal exam was negative for mass or active bleeding with a normal sphincter tone. His labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) of 17.7 with left shift (neutrophil of 85.7 and bands 25%), hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.8, potassium of 3.3, magnesium of 1.5 and lactate of 2.2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine of 21/1.0, alkaline phosphatase of 136, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 218, alanine transaminase (ALT) 242 and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Urine analysis (UA) was positive for nitrites, LE 2+, packed field with WBC and many bacteria on urine microscopy.
Chest X-ray (CXR) did not demonstrate any acute cardiopulmonary disease. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed two multilocular, hypoattenuating lesions in the right lobe of the liver which were 7-8 cm in size (Figure ), new as compared to previous CT scan done three months prior (Figure ). Cross-sectional imaging was also suggestive of sigmoid diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. At this point, the main focus was on multifocal, metastatic infection to the liver versus primary liver abscesses. The patient was admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring and management of sepsis secondary to hepatic abscesses/complicated UTI. Blood and urine cultures were taken before the initiation of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics.
He underwent percutaneous drainage of both liver collections and fluid analysis was performed. The fluid was tested for ova and parasite with negative results. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Fluid microscopy revealed abundant neutrophils consistent with abscess. Cultures were positive for S. constellatus. Blood cultures isolated S. constellatus which was concordant with fluid studies. Urine culture was significant for E. coli. Serological testing for Echinococcus antibody was negative. Based on the culture and sensitivity of liver fluid collections, he was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient was managed for Gram-positive bacteremia and repeat cultures after initiation of parenteral antibiotics were negative. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed to continue intravenous antibiotics for six weeks.
Follow-up CT revealed a sigmoid abscess and findings consistent with colo-vesical fistula (Figure ). The sigmoid abscess was drained percutaneously, but not cultured. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed for initial management of colo-vesical fistula with plans for definitive surgery in the future. Work up for inflammatory bowel disease was negative including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.
He was discharged home with PICC line in place with arrangements for outpatient IV antibiotics. During outpatient follow up, both liver abscess were fully resolved (Figure ). He completed six weeks of IV antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. He will follow up with urology for definitive repair of colovesical fistula.

Here is the patient note:
Here we report a case of a 41-year-old man with past medical history (PMH) of asthma, urinary tract infection (UTI), erectile dysfunction, and diverticulosis with a prior episode of diverticulitis who had presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain and managed for complicated UTI secondary to prostatitis/nephrolithiasis in July 2019, three months prior to the current presentation. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal any growth at that time and CT of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diverticulitis of descending colon, thickening of bladder wall, and prostatic calcifications, with no liver lesions. He was discharged home on oral levofloxacin and his pain resolved with completion of outpatient course of oral antibiotics.
He came to the ER three months later in October 2019 with a two-day history of RUQ pain, 9/10 in intensity, not related to oral intake, and relieved by lying supine. It was associated with anorexia and malaise. He also mentioned a one-week history of fever, rigors, and generalized weakness.

So score 1.</think> Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the components of the CURB-65 score: - C: Confusion - U: Urea (BUN) > 7 mmol/L - R: Respiratory rate >= 30 breaths per minute - B: Blood pressure (systolic < 90 mmHg or diastolic <= 60 mmHg) - 65: Age >= 65 years Step 2: Evaluate each component based on the given information: - **Confusion (C):** The patient note does not mention any signs of confusion. Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Urea (U):** The patient's BUN is 21 mg/dL. To convert BUN from mg/dL to mmol/L, we use the conversion factor: 1 mg/dL = 0.357 mmol/L. \[ \text{BUN in mmol/L} = 21 \times 0.357 \approx 7.5 \, \text{mmol/L}.\] Since 7.5 mmol/L > 7 mmol/L, this criterion is met. - **Respiratory rate (R):** The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. Since 19 < 30, this criterion is not met. - **Blood pressure (B):** The patient's blood pressure is 121/79 mmHg. The systolic BP is 121 mmHg (which is > 90 mmHg), and the diastolic BP is 79 mmHg (which is > 60 mmHg). Therefore, this criterion is not met. - **Age >= 65 (65):** The patient is 41 years old. Since 41 < 65, this criterion is not met. Now, let's count the number of criteria that are met: - Confusion: No - Urea > 7 mmol/L: Yes (7.5 mmol/L > 7 mmol/L) - Respiratory rate >= 30: No - Blood pressure low: No - Age >= 65: No Only one criterion (Urea > 7 mmol/L) is met. Therefore, the CURB-65 score is 1. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the CURB-65 score, we need to evaluate the following components: C (Confusion), U (Urea > 7 mmol/L), R (Respiratory rate >= 30), B (Blood pressure low: systolic < 90 or diastolic <= 60), and 65 (Age >= 65). From the patient note:\n- Confusion: No mention of confusion, so this is not met.\n- Urea (BUN): The BUN is 21 mg/dL. Converting BUN to mmol/L: 21 mg/dL * 0.357 = 7.5 mmol/L.

Provide answer.</think> It seems there's a misunderstanding with the given information. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Convert the doses of each medication to MME. 1. **Hydromorphone**: The patient takes 10 mg of hydromorphone once a day. - The conversion factor from hydromorphone to MME is 4. - Therefore, 10 mg of hydromorphone = 10 mg * 4 = 40 MME. 2. **Fentanyl Patch**: The patient takes 40 mg of fentanyl patch 3 times a day. - This seems unusual because fentanyl patches are typically measured in micrograms (mcg) and not milligrams (mg). However, we'll use the given information as it is. - The conversion factor for fentanyl patches is that 1 mcg/hour of fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 2.4 MME/day. But if we take the given information as 40 mg patches, it's highly unusual and likely a mistake. Let's assume it's a typo and it should be 40 mcg/hour patches. - A 40 mcg/hour fentanyl patch delivers 40 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 960 mcg/day. - The MME for a 40 mcg/hour patch is approximately 960 mcg/day * (2.4 MME / 1000 mcg) = 2.304 MME/day for one patch. - Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, this would mean they are using 3 patches per day. Therefore, the total MME from the fentanyl patches would be 2.304 MME/patch * 3 patches = 6.912 MME/day. But if we take the given information literally (40 mg patches), it's not standard and would require a different approach. Let's assume it's a typo and use the 40 mcg/hour approach. 3. **Tramadol**: The patient takes 60 mg of tramadol twice a day. - The conversion factor from tramadol to MME is 0.1. - Therefore, the total daily dose of tramadol is 60 mg * 2 = 120 mg/day. - The MME for 120 mg of tramadol is 120 mg * 0.1 = 12 MME. Now, let's sum up the MME from all medications: - Hydromorphone: 40 MME - Fentanyl (assuming 40 mcg/hour patches): 6.912 MME - Tramadol: 12 MME Total MME = 40 MME + 6.912 MME + 12 MME = 58.912 MME. If we assume the fentanyl is indeed 40 mg patches (which is highly unusual), we need to find an appropriate conversion. Let's assume the fentanyl patch is 40 mcg/hour. If it's 40 mcg/hour, the daily dose is 40 mcg/hour * 24 hours = 960 mcg/day. The conversion factor is approximately 2.4 MME for every 1000 mcg/day. So, 960 mcg/day * (2.4 MME / 1000 mcg) = 2.304 MME for one patch. Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, the total MME from the fentanyl patches is 2.304 MME/patch * 3 = 6.912 MME. Thus, the total MME is 40 (from hydromorphone) + 6.912 (from fentanyl) + 12 (from tramadol) = 58.912 MME. So the final answer is approximately 58.912 MME. But if the fentanyl is indeed 40 mg patches (which is highly unusual), we need to use a different approach. Let's assume the fentanyl is 40 mg patches. If it's 40 mg patches, and we don't have a standard conversion for such a high dose, we can use the conversion for fentanyl tablets or liquid, which is 100 MME for 1 mg of fentanyl. So, 40 mg of fentanyl * 100 MME/mg = 4000 MME for one patch. Since the patient uses the patch 3 times a day, the total MME from the fentanyl patches is 4000 MME/patch * 3 = 12000 MME. Thus, the total MME is 40 (from hydromorphone) + 12000 (from fentanyl) + 12 (from tramadol) = 12052 MME. Given the unusual nature of the fentanyl dose, the more likely scenario is that it's a typo and should be 40 mcg/hour. So the final answer is 58.912 MME. Thus the answer is approximately 59 MME. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME), we need to convert each medication to its MME and sum them up.\n\n1. **Hydromorphone**: The patient takes 10 mg of hydromorphone once a day.\n - Conversion factor: 1 mg of hydromorphone = 4 MME.\n - Therefore, 10 mg of hydromorphone = 10 * 4 = 40 MME.\n\n2. **Fentanyl Patch**: The patient takes 40 mg of fentanyl patch 3 times a day.\n - This seems unusual because fentanyl patches are typically measured in micrograms (mcg).

 Here is the patient note:
A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.
On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.
As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.
Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.
General anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.
The abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.
During operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).

Here is the task:
What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.

<think>Need weight 68 kg, height 168 cm. BMI = 68/(1.68^2)=68/2.8224=24.1 normal. So adjusted weight = min(ideal, actual). Ideal weight for male: 50 + 2.3*(height-152.4 cm). Height 168 cm => diff 15.6 cm. 2.3*15.6=35.88. Ideal = 85.88 kg. Minimum of ideal and actual = 68 kg. Use Cockcroft-Gault: CrCl = ((140 - age)*weight*0.85)/ (Creatinine*72). Age 66. Creatinine 5.09 mg/dL. Weight 68. Compute: 140-66=74. 74*68=5032. 5032*0.85=4279.2. Divide by (5.09*72=366.48). 4279.2/366.48=11.68 mL/min. Round maybe 11.7.</think>

He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future. As a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%. Before the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg.

The minimum is 68 kg.\n\nSo, the adjusted body weight is 68 kg.\n\nStep 3: Use the Cockcroft-Gault Equation to calculate the Creatinine Clearance.\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault Equation is given by:\n\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * 1.23 if male) / (Creatinine * 72), but the version without the 1.23 multiplier for males is also commonly used: CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight) / (Creatinine * 72 * 1.73 if adjusting for body surface area, but here we use the weight directly).\n\nHowever, the standard Cockcroft-Gault equation for males is:\n\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * weight) / (Creatinine * 72).\n\nGiven data:\n- Age = 66 years. - Weight = 68 kg (adjusted body weight). - Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL. Now plug in the values into the Cockcroft-Gault Equation: CrCl = ((140 - 66) * 68) / (5.09 * 72). Calculate step by step: 1. Calculate (140 - 66): 140 - 66 = 74. 2. Multiply this result by the weight (68 kg): 74 * 68 = 5032. 3. Calculate the denominator (Creatinine * 72): 5.09 * 72 = 366.48. 4. Now divide the numerator by the denominator: CrCl = 5032 / 366.48 ≈ 13.73 mL/min. It seems I made an error in the previous thinking process. Let's correct it. The Cockcroft-Gault equation for males is: CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * 1.23) / (Creatinine * 72). Let's use this corrected formula. Given: - Age = 66 years. - Weight = 68 kg. - Creatinine = 5.09 mg/dL. Plugging in the values: CrCl = ((140 - 66) * 68 * 1.23) / (5.09 * 72). Step-by-step calculation: 1.

Calculate the denominator (Creatinine * 72): 5.09 * 72 = 366.48. 5. Now divide the numerator by the denominator: CrCl = 6188.16 / 366.48 ≈ 16.89 mL/min.

The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).', 'Question': "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 66 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 5.09 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m. The patient's weight is 68.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old woman came to our emergency department complaining of severe general weakness and epigastric pain for the last 5 days. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.
On admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.
Only standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.

In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with AN and borderline personality disorder at a local psychiatric clinic 5 years ago. The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5℃. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", 'Question': "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in milliseconds. The heart rate (HR) is 136 bpm. The formula to calculate the RR interval in milliseconds is: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{HR}} \times 1000. \] Plugging in the given heart rate: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{136} \times 1000. \] Perform the division: \[ \frac{60}{136} \approx 0.441176. \] Now multiply by 1000: \[ \text{RR} \approx 0.441176 \times 1000 = 441.176 \, \text{ms}. \] Step 2: Use the Rautaharju formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Rautaharju formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 ms and the RR interval we just calculated is approximately 441.176 ms, we plug these values into the formula. First, calculate \(\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}\): \[ \frac{\text{RR}}{1000} = \frac{441.176}{1000} = 0.441176. \] Next, take the square root of this value: \[ \sqrt{\frac{\text{RR}}{1000}} = \sqrt{0.441176} \approx 0.6642. \] Now, use this result to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6642} \approx 496.86. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 497 ms. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 497 ms.

The cycle length is 28 days, which is the standard cycle length used in Naegele's rule. Naegele's Rule states that the estimated due date (EDD) is calculated by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of the last menstrual period. To apply Naegele's Rule: Step 1: Add 7 days to the first day of the LMP. Step 2: Subtract 3 months from the resulting date. Step 3: Add 1 year to the resulting date. Let's apply these steps to the given LMP of 05/20/2020. Step 1: Add 7 days to 05/20/2020. 05/20/2020 + 7 days = 05/27/2020. Step 2: Subtract 3 months from 05/27/2020. Subtracting 3 months from 05/27/2020 takes us to 02/27/2020. Step 3: Add 1 year to 02/27/2020. Adding 1 year to 02/27/2020 gives us 02/27/2021. So the estimated due date is 02/27/2021. Thus the correct estimated due date is 02/27/2021. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule, we follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14-year-old female with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 3 days was admitted to the local clinic with the diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis. Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35℃). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th–50th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th–75th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.
This study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.

Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6–2.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0–1 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient’s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old female was brought to the emergency department by paramedics after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On scene, she was found unrestrained in the vehicle, with the air bag deployed. Upon arrival in the trauma bay, she had heart rate of 72 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. Her eyes open upon painful stimulus. On examination, a pinch to the nail bed induces a withdrawal response in her extremities. Her speech is incomprehensible. She grunts and moans on occasion, but no discernible words are appreciated. Her pupils are equal, round, and unreactive to light. Blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and a toxicology screen, is initiated together with a CT scan of her head and neck. The trauma team commences resuscitative measures with an emphasis on preserving neurological function.

Step 1: Convert the heart rate (HR) to RR interval in seconds. The heart rate is 144 bpm. The RR interval is the time between successive heartbeats. It can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate (in bpm)}}. \] So, \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{144} = 0.4167 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Framingham formula is given by: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec and the RR interval is 0.4167 seconds, we plug these values into the formula. First, calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.4167} \approx 0.6455. \] Now, use this to calculate the corrected QT interval: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.6455} \approx 511.69. \] Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 512 msec.

Format M/D/Y: 1/17/2022.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the estimated due date using Naegele's Rule adjusted for the cycle length, we'll follow these steps: 1. The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) is 04/09/2021. 2. The cycle length is 25 days. Naegele's Rule typically adds 280 days to the LMP for a standard 28-day cycle. Since the cycle length is 25 days (which is shorter than the standard 28 days), we need to adjust the due date by adding the difference between the standard cycle length and the patient's cycle length to the 280 days. The adjustment is: 280 + (28 - cycle length) = 280 + (28 - 25) = 280 + 3 = 283 days. So, we need to add 283 days to the LMP (April 9, 2021). Let's calculate this step by step: - Start from April 9, 2021. We will add the days month by month until we reach the total of 283 days. April has 30 days.

 Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1.

Here is the patient note:
A 66 year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for progressive shortness of breath and poor health condition for 1 week. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and arterial blood gas analysis was pH; 6.98, pCO2; 99 mmHg, pO2; 66 mmHg. She was immediately intubated and transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade (posteriorly 3 cm, anteriorly 2.5 cm, laterally 2 cm and 2.7 cm in adjacency with the right ventricle). The patient had non valvular AF and been receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily for one year. In addition to dabigatran, the other medications included verapamil, budesonide, valsartan, and hydrochlorotiazide. She had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her blood tests performed 1 year ago showed serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL) and estimated creatinine clearance 136 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation).
On admission her blood tests showed blood urea nitrogen 163.9 mg/dL (normal range 16.6-48.5 mg/dL), creatinine 3.99 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-0.9 mg/dL), estimated creatinine clearance 16 mL/minute (using the Cock-croft-Gault equation), fasting glucose 83.9 mg/dL (normal range 74-109 mg/dL), sodium 130 mmol/L (normal range 136-145 mmol/L), potassium 5.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), prothrombin time (PT) 44.5 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 123.7 s (normal range 26-32 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 4.79, white blood cell count 10.59 103/uL (normal range 4.4-11.3 103/uL), hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL (normal range 11.7-16.1 g/dL), hematocrit 25.7% (normal range 35-47%), and platelet count 183 103/uL (normal range 152-396 103/uL).
Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with echocardiographic guidance and 1500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was removed. Pericardial fluid analysis showed hemoglobin 7 g/dL and plasma hemoglobin level of the patient was 7.7 g/dL. Cytologic exam was negative for malignancy. Biochemical tests showed total protein 5.4 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 707 mg/dL and albumin 2.98 mg/dL.
Six hours after pericardiocentesis, the patients' blood pressure was over 100 mmHg systolic and she began to urinate. Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were made and post-transfusion hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL, PT 36.4 s (normal range 11.5-15 s), aPTT 100.5 s (normal range 26-32 s), and INR 4.1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 76-year-old gentleman visits the clinic for a follow-up. His impressive journey through life is marked by several health challenges. At the forefront of his medical history is hepatoblastoma that he battled; he has been in remission since the completion of his treatment regimen. Leukemia has also been a significant chapter within his medical narrative, which he's managing with the appropriate therapy. His heart endures the strain of congestive heart failure; ongoing management of this condition has been emphasized by his healthcare team. He has managed to keep his type II diabetes mellitus uncomplicated with diet management and regular exercise. A clinical assessment had led to a diagnosis of dementia, which has progressively been impacting his coping abilities and presenting social challenges for him. He also presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of severe liver disease, contributing to his complicated health status. Status post cerebral vascular accident has been another turning point in his health journey, although he didn’t suffer any significant residual deficits. However, the patient denies having transient ischemic attacks. His experience with autoimmune disorders is punctuated by a diagnosis of connective tissue disease which is being persistently managed. Despite his rich past medical history, he shows no signs of chronic kidney disease, AIDS, any peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His spirit and engagement towards managing his chronic health conditions have been outstanding, with regular follow-ups and compliance to his multifaceted treatment plan.

Here are the conditions mentioned and their respective scores according to the CCI: 1. **Hepatoblastoma**: This is a type of cancer. According to the CCI, any malignancy except for hematologic malignancies is scored as 6. However, since the patient is in remission from hepatoblastoma, we need to consider if it's still active. Since it's stated that he is in remission, it might not be counted unless it's an active malignancy. But for the sake of this calculation, let's consider it as a past malignancy that could potentially contribute to the score. However, typically, past malignancies that are in remission for more than 5 years are not included in the CCI unless they are hematologic malignancies or metastatic solid tumors. 2. **Leukemia**: Leukemia is a hematologic malignancy and is scored as 2 in the CCI. 3. **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**: This condition is scored as 1 in the CCI. 4. **Type II Diabetes Mellitus**: Diabetes without complications is scored as 1 in the CCI. 5. **Dementia**: Dementia is scored as 1 in the CCI. 6. **Severe Liver Disease**: Severe liver disease (cirrhosis) is scored as 3 in the CCI. 7. **Status Post Cerebral Vascular Accident (Stroke)**: Stroke is scored as 1 in the CCI. 8. **Connective Tissue Disease**: Connective tissue disease is not explicitly listed in the standard Charlson Comorbidity Index. Typically, connective tissue diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus are not included in the standard CCI unless they lead to specific complications that are included in the index (like renal disease or heart disease). Since connective tissue disease is not a standard item in the CCI, it is generally not scored unless it leads to other conditions that are included in the CCI. Now let's sum up the scores for the conditions that are clearly included in the CCI: - Leukemia: 2 - Congestive Heart Failure: 1 - Diabetes Mellitus: 1 - Dementia: 1 - Severe Liver Disease: 3 - Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke): 1 Adding these scores together: \[ 2 (Leukemia) + 1 (CHF) + 1 (Diabetes) + 1 (Dementia) + 3 (Severe Liver Disease) + 1 (Stroke) = 9 \] If we also consider the hepatoblastoma as an active malignancy (though it's in remission), it would be scored as 6. But since it's in remission, it's typically not included unless it's within the first 5 years after diagnosis or treatment. So the total score without including the hepatoblastoma is 9. If we include the hepatoblastoma as an active malignancy (which is a stretch since it's in remission), the score would be: \[ 9 + 6 = 15 \] But since the patient is in remission from hepatoblastoma, it's more appropriate to exclude it unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the total Charlson Comorbidity Index score is 9. For connective tissue disease, if it leads to complications such as renal disease or heart disease, those complications would be scored separately. Since no such complications are mentioned, we won't add any points for connective tissue disease. Thus, the final score is 9.

 Here is the patient note:
A 32-year-old Japanese woman with AN and pancytopenia was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital. The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).
The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.
At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL).
The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.
On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

Bone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 × 103 cells/μL; reference range: 100–200 × 103 cells/μL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/μL; reference range: 50–150 cells/μL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient’s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.
After bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient’s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient’s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient’s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene). The patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient’s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/μL; reference range, 4000–9000 cells/μL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0–15.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient’s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2. At 32 years of age, the patient’s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/μL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/μL (reference range: 1600–5400 cells/μL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/μL (reference range: 80–610 cells/μL); low basophil count, 30 cells/μL (reference range: 0–180 cells/μL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/μL (reference range: 1060–4190 cells/μL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/μL (reference range: 90–690 cells/μL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 × 103 cells/μL (reference range: 35.0–125.0 × 103 cells/μL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0–100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 × 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7–32.9 × 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0–19.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/μL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 × 104 cells/dL). The patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient’s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support. On admission, the patient’s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/μL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 × 103 cells/μL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 × 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient's last menstrual period was on 03/24/2017. Her cycle length is 30 days.

Here is the task:
Using Naegele's Rule for estimated due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length, what is the the patient's estimated due date? Your response should be in the format of M/D/Y (ie 08/31/2023, 07/03/2000) with just the date and not other text. 

Please directly output the JSON dict formatted as {"step_by_step_thinking": str(your_step_by_step_thinking_procress_to_solve_the_question), "answer": str(short_and_direct_answer_of_the_question)}:
THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute due date. LMP 03/24/2017. Cycle length 30 days. Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP. But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))? Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP. For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days. Let's compute. March 24, 2017 + 282 days. Compute: 2017 is not leap year? 2017 not leap. Days remaining in March after 24: 31-24=7 days. So after March 24, 7 days to end of March. Then April 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, January 2018 31, February 2018 28, March 2018 31, April 2018 30, May 2018 31, June 2018 30, July 2018 31, August 2018 31, September 2018 30, October 2018 31, November 2018 30, December 2018 31, January 2019 31, February 2019 28, March 2019 31, April 2019 30, May 2019 31, June 2019 30, July 2019 31, August 2019 31, September 2019 30, October 2019 31, November 2019 30, December 2019 31, January 2020 31, February 2020 29 (leap), March 2020 31, April 2020 30, May 2020 31, June 2020 30, July 2020 31, August 2020 31, September 2020 30, October 2020 31, November 2020 30, December 2020 31, January 2021 31, February 2021 28, March 2021 31, April 2021 30, May 2021 31, June 2021 30, July 2021 31, August 2021 31, September 2021 30, October 2021 31, November 2021 30, December 2021 31, January 2022 31, February 2022 28, March 2022 31, April 2022 30, May 2022 31, June 2022 30, July 2022 31, August 2022 31, September 2022 30, October 2022 31, November 2022 30, December 2022 31, January 2023 31, February 2023 28, March 2023 31, April 2023 30, May 2023 31, June 2023 30, July 2023 31, August 2023 31, September 2023 30, October 2023 31, November 2023 30, December 2023 31, January 2024 31, February 2024 29, March 2024 31, April 2024 30, May 2024 31, June 2024 30, July 2024 31, August 2024 31, September 2024 30, October 2024 31, November 2024 30, December 2024 31, January 2025 31, February 2025 28, March 2025 31, April 2025 30, May 2025 31, June 2025 30, July 2025 31, August 2025 31, September 2025 30, October 2025 31, November 2025 30, December 2025 31. But easier: 282 days from March 24, 2017. Let's compute using date arithmetic: March 24 + 282 days. We can use months: 2017: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. Remaining 282-7=275 days. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0? Wait after November 30 we have 31 days left. December has 31 days, so 31-31=0. So due date is December 31, 2017? Let's check: After subtracting months, we ended at December 31, 2017. That seems plausible: LMP March 24 2017 + 280 days would be December 31 2017? Let's verify: 280 days from March 24 2017 is December 31 2017 indeed. Adding 2 days for cycle length 30 gives January 2, 2018. Wait we added 282 days, we got December 31? Let's double-check arithmetic. Let's compute using known: 280 days from March 24 2017 = December 31 2017. Because 280 days is 40 weeks. March 24 + 280 days = December 31. Yes. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. Let's recompute: March 24 + 282 days = January 2, 2018. Let's verify: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So we ended at December 31, 2017. Wait we subtracted 31 days of December, leaving 0. That means the 282nd day is December 31? But we subtracted 31 days of December, but we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So after subtracting December, we reached 0 days left, meaning the due date is December 31, 2017. But that would be 282 days? Let's check: March 24 to December 31 inclusive? Let's count days: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days (24-31 inclusive? Actually 24 to 31 exclusive? Let's count: 24->25 1, 25->26 2, 26->27 3, 27->28 4, 28->29 5, 29->30 6, 30->31 7. So 7 days. Good. Then April 30 days, etc. Sum: 7+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 =? 7+30=37, +31=68, +30=98, +31=129, +31=160, +30=190, +31=221, +30=251, +31=282. Yes total 282 days. So due date is December 31, 2017. Wait but we added 282 days, we ended at December 31. So due date is December 31, 2017. But earlier we thought 280 days gives December 31. Let's check: 280 days from March 24 2017: subtract 2 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also gives December 31. Wait that means 280 days also gives December 31? That seems wrong. Let's compute again: 280 days from March 24 2017 should be December 31 2017? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017. Yes. So 280 days gives December 31. Then 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our calculation shows 282 days also December 31. Something off. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That means 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. Wait we mis-subtracted: For 282 days, after subtracting December 31 we had 0 days left. But we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So 31 days left after subtracting November 30. So 31 days left to subtract December. So 31 days left after subtracting December 31? That would be 0. So 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. That can't be. Let's check difference: 282-280=2 days. So 282 days should be 2 days later. So our subtraction for 280 days must be wrong. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That suggests 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction for 282 days gave same result. Let's recompute 282 days: 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So 282 days also December 31. So difference is 0. That indicates our subtraction for 280 days incorrectly used 7 days for March? Actually March 24 to March 31 inclusive is 8 days? Let's count inclusive: March 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 = 8 days. But when adding days, we usually count days after the start date. So March 24 + 1 day = March 25. So March 24 + 7 days = March 31. So 7 days is correct. So 280 days from March 24 should be December 31. So 282 days should be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. That means we miscounted months: maybe December has 31 days, but we subtracted 31 days leaving 0. That means 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. So difference 0. So maybe we mis-subtracted 280 days: maybe 280 days ends at December 29? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's quickly check using known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's use quick mental: March 24 to April 24 = 31 days. April 24 to May 24 = 30 days (61). May 24 to June 24 = 31 (92). June 24 to July 24 = 30 (122). July 24 to Aug 24 = 31 (153). Aug 24 to Sep 24 = 31 (184). Sep 24 to Oct 24 = 30 (214). Oct 24 to Nov 24 = 31 (245). Nov 24 to Dec 24 = 30 (275). Dec 24 to Jan 2 = 9 days (284). So 280 days would be Dec 20? Wait this is messy. Let's use simpler: 280 days = 40 weeks. March 24 2017 + 40 weeks = December 31 2017? Let's check: March 24 + 40 weeks = March 24 + 280 days. March 24 2017 is a Wednesday. 40 weeks later is December 31 2017 (Wednesday). That seems plausible. So 280 days = Dec 31. So 282 days = Jan 2 2018. So answer should be 01/02/2018. Thus due date: 01/02/2018.
THINKING USED We need to compute due date. LMP 03/24/2017. Cycle length 30 days. Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP. But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))? Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP. For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days. Let's compute. March 24, 2017 + 282 days. Compute: 2017 is not leap year? 2017 not leap. Days remaining in March after 24: 31-24=7 days. So after March 24, 7 days to end of March. Then April 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, January 2018 31, February 2018 28, March 2018 31, April 2018 30, May 2018 31, June 2018 30, July 2018 31, August 2018 31, September 2018 30, October 2018 31, November 2018 30, December 2018 31, January 2019 31, February 2019 28, March 2019 31, April 2019 30, May 2019 31, June 2019 30, July 2019 31, August 2019 31, September 2019 30, October 2019 31, November 2019 30, December 2019 31, January 2020 31, February 2020 29 (leap), March 2020 31, April 2020 30, May 2020 31, June 2020 30, July 2020 31, August 2020 31, September 2020 30, October 2020 31, November 2020 30, December 2020 31, January 2021 31, February 2021 28, March 2021 31, April 2021 30, May 2021 31, June 2021 30, July 2021 31, August 2021 31, September 2021 30, October 2021 31, November 2021 30, December 2021 31, January 2022 31, February 2022 28, March 2022 31, April 2022 30, May 2022 31, June 2022 30, July 2022 31, August 2022 31, September 2022 30, October 2022 31, November 2022 30, December 2022 31, January 2023 31, February 2023 28, March 2023 31, April 2023 30, May 2023 31, June 2023 30, July 2023 31, August 2023 31, September 2023 30, October 2023 31, November 2023 30, December 2023 31, January 2024 31, February 2024 29, March 2024 31, April 2024 30, May 2024 31, June 2024 30, July 2024 31, August 2024 31, September 2024 30, October 2024 31, November 2024 30, December 2024 31, January 2025 31, February 2025 28, March 2025 31, April 2025 30, May 2025 31, June 2025 30, July 2025 31, August 2025 31, September 2025 30, October 2025 31, November 2025 30, December 2025 31.

Let's check: March 24 + 40 weeks = March 24 + 280 days. March 24 2017 is a Wednesday. 40 weeks later is December 31 2017 (Wednesday). That seems plausible. So 280 days = Dec 31.

<think>We need to compute due date. LMP 03/24/2017. Cycle length 30 days. Naegele's rule: add 280 days (40 weeks) to LMP. But if cycle length differs from 28 days, adjust: add (280 - (28 - cycle length))? Actually standard: add 280 days to LMP. For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days. Let's compute. March 24, 2017 + 282 days. Compute: 2017 is not leap year? 2017 not leap. Days remaining in March after 24: 31-24=7 days. So after March 24, 7 days to end of March. Then April 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, January 2018 31, February 2018 28, March 2018 31, April 2018 30, May 2018 31, June 2018 30, July 2018 31, August 2018 31, September 2018 30, October 2018 31, November 2018 30, December 2018 31, January 2019 31, February 2019 28, March 2019 31, April 2019 30, May 2019 31, June 2019 30, July 2019 31, August 2019 31, September 2019 30, October 2019 31, November 2019 30, December 2019 31, January 2020 31, February 2020 29 (leap), March 2020 31, April 2020 30, May 2020 31, June 2020 30, July 2020 31, August 2020 31, September 2020 30, October 2020 31, November 2020 30, December 2020 31, January 2021 31, February 2021 28, March 2021 31, April 2021 30, May 2021 31, June 2021 30, July 2021 31, August 2021 31, September 2021 30, October 2021 31, November 2021 30, December 2021 31, January 2022 31, February 2022 28, March 2022 31, April 2022 30, May 2022 31, June 2022 30, July 2022 31, August 2022 31, September 2022 30, October 2022 31, November 2022 30, December 2022 31, January 2023 31, February 2023 28, March 2023 31, April 2023 30, May 2023 31, June 2023 30, July 2023 31, August 2023 31, September 2023 30, October 2023 31, November 2023 30, December 2023 31, January 2024 31, February 2024 29, March 2024 31, April 2024 30, May 2024 31, June 2024 30, July 2024 31, August 2024 31, September 2024 30, October 2024 31, November 2024 30, December 2024 31, January 2025 31, February 2025 28, March 2025 31, April 2025 30, May 2025 31, June 2025 30, July 2025 31, August 2025 31, September 2025 30, October 2025 31, November 2025 30, December 2025 31. But easier: 282 days from March 24, 2017. Let's compute using date arithmetic: March 24 + 282 days. We can use months: 2017: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. Remaining 282-7=275 days. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0? Wait after November 30 we have 31 days left. December has 31 days, so 31-31=0. So due date is December 31, 2017? Let's check: After subtracting months, we ended at December 31, 2017. That seems plausible: LMP March 24 2017 + 280 days would be December 31 2017? Let's verify: 280 days from March 24 2017 is December 31 2017 indeed. Adding 2 days for cycle length 30 gives January 2, 2018. Wait we added 282 days, we got December 31? Let's double-check arithmetic. Let's compute using known: 280 days from March 24 2017 = December 31 2017. Because 280 days is 40 weeks. March 24 + 280 days = December 31. Yes. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. Let's recompute: March 24 + 282 days = January 2, 2018. Let's verify: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So we ended at December 31, 2017. Wait we subtracted 31 days of December, leaving 0. That means the 282nd day is December 31? But we subtracted 31 days of December, but we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So after subtracting December, we reached 0 days left, meaning the due date is December 31, 2017. But that would be 282 days? Let's check: March 24 to December 31 inclusive? Let's count days: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days (24-31 inclusive? Actually 24 to 31 exclusive? Let's count: 24->25 1, 25->26 2, 26->27 3, 27->28 4, 28->29 5, 29->30 6, 30->31 7. So 7 days. Good. Then April 30 days, etc. Sum: 7+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 =? 7+30=37, +31=68, +30=98, +31=129, +31=160, +30=190, +31=221, +30=251, +31=282. Yes total 282 days. So due date is December 31, 2017. Wait but we added 282 days, we ended at December 31. So due date is December 31, 2017. But earlier we thought 280 days gives December 31. Let's check: 280 days from March 24 2017: subtract 2 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also gives December 31. Wait that means 280 days also gives December 31? That seems wrong. Let's compute again: 280 days from March 24 2017 should be December 31 2017? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017. Yes. So 280 days gives December 31. Then 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our calculation shows 282 days also December 31. Something off. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That means 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. Wait we mis-subtracted: For 282 days, after subtracting December 31 we had 0 days left. But we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So 31 days left after subtracting November 30. So 31 days left to subtract December. So 31 days left after subtracting December 31? That would be 0. So 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. That can't be. Let's check difference: 282-280=2 days. So 282 days should be 2 days later. So our subtraction for 280 days must be wrong. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That suggests 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction for 282 days gave same result. Let's recompute 282 days: 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So 282 days also December 31. So difference is 0. That indicates our subtraction for 280 days incorrectly used 7 days for March? Actually March 24 to March 31 inclusive is 8 days? Let's count inclusive: March 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 = 8 days. But when adding days, we usually count days after the start date. So March 24 + 1 day = March 25. So March 24 + 7 days = March 31. So 7 days is correct. So 280 days from March 24 should be December 31. So 282 days should be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. That means we miscounted months: maybe December has 31 days, but we subtracted 31 days leaving 0. That means 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. So difference 0. So maybe we mis-subtracted 280 days: maybe 280 days ends at December 29? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's quickly check using known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's use quick mental: March 24 to April 24 = 31 days. April 24 to May 24 = 30 days (61). May 24 to June 24 = 31 (92). June 24 to July 24 = 30 (122). July 24 to Aug 24 = 31 (153). Aug 24 to Sep 24 = 31 (184). Sep 24 to Oct 24 = 30 (214). Oct 24 to Nov 24 = 31 (245). Nov 24 to Dec 24 = 30 (275). Dec 24 to Jan 2 = 9 days (284). So 280 days would be Dec 20? Wait this is messy. Let's use simpler: 280 days = 40 weeks. March 24 2017 + 40 weeks = December 31 2017? Let's check: March 24 + 40 weeks = March 24 + 280 days. March 24 2017 is a Wednesday. 40 weeks later is December 31 2017 (Wednesday). That seems plausible. So 280 days = Dec 31. So 282 days = Jan 2 2018. So answer should be 01/02/2018. Thus due date: 01/02/2018.</think>

So 282 days = Jan 2 2018. So answer should be 01/02/2018.

For the LMP of 03/24/2017, adding 280 days gives us the due date for a 28-day cycle. To add 280 days to 03/24/2017: - First, we add 7 days to reach the end of March: 31 - 24 = 7 days remaining in March. So, March 31st is 7 days after March 24th. - Subtract these 7 days from 280: 280 - 7 = 273 days remaining. - April has 30 days. Adding April's 30 days to the remaining 273 days: 273 - 30 = 243 days remaining. - May has 31 days. Subtract 31 from the remaining 243 days: 243 - 31 = 212 days remaining. - June has 30 days.

Since we have 29 days remaining after November, adding these 29 days to December 1st will take us to December 29 + 1st = December 30th (since December 1st + 29 days = December 30th). So, adding 280 days to 03/24/2017 gives us December 31, 2017.

For cycle length >28, subtract days difference? Wait: For cycle length 30, ovulation occurs 2 days later, so due date is 2 days later. So add 280 days + (cycle length - 28). So 280 + 2 = 282 days.

But easier: 282 days from March 24, 2017. Let's compute using date arithmetic: March 24 + 282 days. We can use months: 2017: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. Remaining 282-7=275 days. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0? Wait after November 30 we have 31 days left. December has 31 days, so 31-31=0. So due date is December 31, 2017? Let's check: After subtracting months, we ended at December 31, 2017. That seems plausible: LMP March 24 2017 + 280 days would be December 31 2017? Let's verify: 280 days from March 24 2017 is December 31 2017 indeed. Adding 2 days for cycle length 30 gives January 2, 2018. Wait we added 282 days, we got December 31? Let's double-check arithmetic. Let's compute using known: 280 days from March 24 2017 = December 31 2017. Because 280 days is 40 weeks. March 24 + 280 days = December 31. Yes. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. Let's recompute: March 24 + 282 days = January 2, 2018. Let's verify: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days. 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So we ended at December 31, 2017. Wait we subtracted 31 days of December, leaving 0. That means the 282nd day is December 31? But we subtracted 31 days of December, but we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So after subtracting December, we reached 0 days left, meaning the due date is December 31, 2017. But that would be 282 days? Let's check: March 24 to December 31 inclusive? Let's count days: March 24 to March 31 = 7 days (24-31 inclusive? Actually 24 to 31 exclusive? Let's count: 24->25 1, 25->26 2, 26->27 3, 27->28 4, 28->29 5, 29->30 6, 30->31 7. So 7 days. Good. Then April 30 days, etc. Sum: 7+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31 =? 7+30=37, +31=68, +30=98, +31=129, +31=160, +30=190, +31=221, +30=251, +31=282. Yes total 282 days. So due date is December 31, 2017. Wait but we added 282 days, we ended at December 31. So due date is December 31, 2017. But earlier we thought 280 days gives December 31. Let's check: 280 days from March 24 2017: subtract 2 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also gives December 31. Wait that means 280 days also gives December 31? That seems wrong. Let's compute again: 280 days from March 24 2017 should be December 31 2017? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017. Yes. So 280 days gives December 31. Then 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our calculation shows 282 days also December 31. Something off. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That means 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. Wait we mis-subtracted: For 282 days, after subtracting December 31 we had 0 days left. But we had 31 days left before subtracting December. So 31 days left after subtracting November 30. So 31 days left to subtract December. So 31 days left after subtracting December 31? That would be 0. So 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. That can't be. Let's check difference: 282-280=2 days. So 282 days should be 2 days later. So our subtraction for 280 days must be wrong. Let's recompute 280 days: 280-7=273. April 30 -> 243. May 31 -> 212. June 30 -> 182. July 31 -> 151. August 31 -> 120. September 30 -> 90. October 31 -> 59. November 30 -> 29. December 31 -> 0. So 280 days also December 31. That suggests 280 days from March 24 is December 31. So 282 days would be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction for 282 days gave same result. Let's recompute 282 days: 282-7=275. April 30 -> 245. May 31 -> 214. June 30 -> 184. July 31 -> 153. August 31 -> 122. September 30 -> 92. October 31 -> 61. November 30 -> 31. December 31 -> 0. So 282 days also December 31. So difference is 0. That indicates our subtraction for 280 days incorrectly used 7 days for March? Actually March 24 to March 31 inclusive is 8 days? Let's count inclusive: March 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 = 8 days. But when adding days, we usually count days after the start date. So March 24 + 1 day = March 25. So March 24 + 7 days = March 31. So 7 days is correct. So 280 days from March 24 should be December 31. So 282 days should be January 2, 2018. But our subtraction shows 282 days also December 31. That means we miscounted months: maybe December has 31 days, but we subtracted 31 days leaving 0. That means 282 days ends at December 31. But 280 days also ends at December 31. So difference 0. So maybe we mis-subtracted 280 days: maybe 280 days ends at December 29? Let's check with known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's quickly check using known: March 24 2017 + 280 days = December 31 2017? Let's use quick mental: March 24 to April 24 = 31 days. April 24 to May 24 = 30 days (61). May 24 to June 24 = 31 (92). June 24 to July 24 = 30 (122). July 24 to Aug 24 = 31 (153). Aug 24 to Sep 24 = 31 (184). Sep 24 to Oct 24 = 30 (214). Oct 24 to Nov 24 = 31 (245). Nov 24 to Dec 24 = 30 (275). Dec 24 to Jan 2 = 9 days (284). So 280 days would be Dec 20? Wait this is messy. Let's use simpler: 280 days = 40 weeks. March 24 2017 + 40 weeks = December 31 2017? Let's check: March 24 + 40 weeks = March 24 + 280 days. March 24 2017 is a Wednesday. 40 weeks later is December 31 2017 (Wednesday). That seems plausible. So 280 days = Dec 31.

So, adding 280 days to 03/24/2017 gives us December 31, 2017.

 Here is the patient note:
A male patient in his early 70s with alcoholic liver disease and diabetes was brought to the hospital due to extreme confusion and unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli. He has been experiencing a progressively worsening mental state suggestive of stage 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. Blood investigation revealed an INR of 1.6, suggesting a coagulopathy consistent with liver disease. His bilirubin was 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin 3.3 g/dL, reflecting liver damage. He has been prescribed a low-protein diet with lactulose and rifaximin and has been referred for an immediate assessment for liver transplantation. His HbA1c level was also measured, which showed well-controlled blood-glucose levels at 7 %.

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute conception date. LMP 10/11/2020. Cycle length 29 days. Ovulation occurs about 14 days before next period. For 29-day cycle, ovulation day = LMP + 15 days? Actually typical: ovulation occurs 14 days before next period. Next period would be LMP + 29 days. So ovulation day = LMP + 29 - 14 = LMP + 15 days. Conception occurs around ovulation day. So conception date = 10/11/2020 + 15 days = 10/26/2020. Let's double-check: 10/11 + 15 days = 10/26. Yes. Output date in M/D/Y: 10/26/2020.

To find the day of ovulation, we subtract 14 days from this next period date. Alternatively, we can calculate the ovulation day directly from the LMP by adding (cycle length - 14) days to the LMP.

 Here is the patient note:
A 68-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our cardiology clinic in February 2008 for further evaluation of a conspicuous new heart murmur. The patient did not have any cardiac complaints and did not suffer from angina pectoris or dyspnoea. The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.
On physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.
Results of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein and 72 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.
An echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.
A histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.
Based on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).
At follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.

A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition.

 Here is the patient note:
A 37-year-old female patient was referred to Hacettepe University, Pediatric Genetics Department following complaints of atypical facial features. She was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birthweight of 1,500 g (lower than 3rd centile). Her birth length and head circumference were not recorded. The patient had delayed psychomotor development and began to walk and speak after the age of 3 years. She has been able to read and write after attending a rehabilitation program. She was evaluated for developmental delay, short stature, learning disability, recurrent upper respiratory system infections, and constipation in childhood, but no diagnosis was made. Laboratory work-up, including cranial imaging, echocardiography, and blood biochemistry were all normal except for subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient had generalized anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis since her adolescence and her symptoms had deteriorated over time. She started to suffer from difficulty falling asleep, especially during the last five years. She was described as over-friendly by her family members. On her admission, a physical examination revealed a weight of 42 kg (lower than 3rd centile), a height of 145 cm (lower than 3rd centile), and a head circumference of 52 cm (−2 standard deviations). Among the facial features, a long face, a long neck accentuated by sloping shoulders, low-set ears, periorbital fullness, a short nose, a wide mouth, a small jaw, and malar flattening were noted (). She was talkative and gregarious. The patient exhibited prolonged phases of staring into our faces and maintained eye contact throughout the physical examination. Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed 46,XX.ish del(7)(q11.2 q11.2) (ELN-), which confirmed the clinical diagnosis (). Genetic counseling was provided to the family and a follow-up plan was created. An informed consent was obtained from the patient.

 Here is the patient note:
The patient discussed in this case report is a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed on metformin and canagliflozin. After undergoing a routine laparoscopic appendectomy, his postoperative course remained uneventful. He started tolerating oral feeds, having bowel movements and remained hemodynamically stable. Therefore, he was discharged two days after the surgery. However, a few hours later, on the day of discharge, he presented to the emergency department with sudden onset generalized abdominal pain, non-exertional shortness of breath, and fever.
On presentation, he was febrile (temperature: 100.7°F), tachycardia (heart rate: 114 bpm), tachypneic (respiratory rate: 30/min), and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. His physical examination was benign; lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and soft, non-tender abdomen. The surgical site looked clean, without any discharge, and was non-tender to touch.
The patient’s initial laboratory measurements were all within normal limits: blood glucose 126 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. The exception was a high anion gap of 20.8 mEq/L and a pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management. A septic workup was initiated, and the patient was placed on empiric antibiotics.
Further laboratory results revealed positive serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.69 mmol/L), whereas the urinalysis revealed glucosuria (urine glucose > 1500 mg/dL) and ketonuria and no proteins. A urine culture was negative for any infectious growth. Serum lactate was 13 mg/dL. A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the patient’s chest showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations suggestive of probable pneumonia. A CAT scan of his abdomen showed probable postoperative ileus with no obstruction or abscess. On further questioning, the patient reported having resumed canagliflozin and his regular diet as instructed upon being discharged.
Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL).
Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin.

Due to a high anion gap and positive ketones in the blood with normal blood glucose levels, the patient was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to his SGLT2-inhibitor use. Thus, canagliflozin was stopped, and the patient was started on an insulin drip with 10% dextrose. Subsequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient’s condition started improving after the treatment with insulin and dextrose. On day two, following admission, his symptoms improved, and subsequent laboratory results also looked better with a lower anion gap of 16.2 mEq/L. On day three following admission, he was switched from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and sliding scale as his laboratory results approached normal, with an anion gap of 13.2 mEq/L and beta-hydroxybutyrate of 0.81 mmol/L. With symptom resolution, the patient was then returned to the floor. However, his urine glucose remained high (>1500 mg/dL). Discharged the next day and advised to continue subcutaneous insulin for a week, the patient was asked to consult his endocrinologist for further management. He was also recommended against resuming canagliflozin. Here is the task: What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

Delta gap = 20.8-12=8.8 mEq/L.</think> However, the question seems to be asking for the change in the anion gap over time, not the delta gap as defined by the formula. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the initial anion gap. The initial anion gap is given as 20.8 mEq/L. Step 2: Identify the anion gap on day 2 after admission. On day 2, the anion gap is given as 16.2 mEq/L. Step 3: Identify the anion gap on day 3 after admission. On day 3, the anion gap is given as 13.2 mEq/L. The question asks for the patient's delta gap in mEq/L. If we interpret this as the change in the anion gap over time, we need to calculate the difference between the initial anion gap and the subsequent anion gaps. Let's calculate the change in the anion gap from the initial value to the value on day 2: Delta gap (from initial to day 2) = Anion gap (initial) - Anion gap (day 2) = 20.8 mEq/L - 16.2 mEq/L = 4.6 mEq/L. And the change in the anion gap from the initial value to the value on day 3: Delta gap (from initial to day 3) = Anion gap (initial) - Anion gap (day 3) = 20.8 mEq/L - 13.2 mEq/L = 7.6 mEq/L. Since the question does not specify which time point to use for the delta gap, I will assume it is asking for the change from the initial anion gap to the final reported anion gap (which is the one on day 3, as it is the last reported value). So the delta gap is 7.6 mEq/L. Thus, the answer is 7.6 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's delta gap in mEq/L, we need to find the change in the anion gap over time.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol.

A 67-year-old gentleman finds himself at the health clinic with recurrent bouts of fatigue. His health voyage is blotted with a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension, which despite efforts, seems to be poorly controlled recently. The patient does not take any blood-thinning agents or other medications known to predispose to bleeding. He admits to mild alcohol consumption, quantifying it at about three drinks per week. His medical trajectory also reveals a major bleeding episode that occurred in the past, claiming a substantial amount of hospital time. Simultaneously, liver function tests over the past few months have indicated irreversible, end stage liver fibrosis, necessitating further evaluation and intervention. However, renal pathologies remain absence in his medical dossier as the renal function records show no signs of compromise.

 Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

Here is the patient note:
A 63-year-old male with recently diagnosed cirrhosis secondary to NAFLD came for a follow-up consultation. During the appointment, he exhibited confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech. Laboratory evaluations were remarkable with an increased INR value at 1.8. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin count of 1.9 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL demonstrating compromised liver function. Additional lab tests showed a glucose level at 130 mg/dL, though hemoglobin A1c was within acceptable bounds which indicate fairly well-controlled DM II. The patient was advised to maintain dietary restrictions and adhere to prescribed therapeutic management. Family intervention was also suggested considering his cognitive impairment. He was reassured that they would initiate steps to manage his encephalopathy right away.

So score 9.</think> The Child-Pugh Score is calculated using the following parameters: 1. Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits confusion, asterixis, and slurred speech, which indicates the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. These symptoms suggest at least Grade 1 encephalopathy. Since the symptoms are moderate (confusion, asterixis), it is likely Grade 2. Let's assign it as Grade 2 for the score calculation. The score for Grade 2 encephalopathy is 2. 2. Ascites: There is no mention of ascites in the patient note. Therefore, the score for ascites is 1 (none). 3. Bilirubin: The total bilirubin count is 1.9 mg/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Bilirubin < 2 mg/dL corresponds to a score of 1. - Bilirubin 2-3 mg/dL corresponds to a score of 2. - Bilirubin 3-6 mg/dL corresponds to a score of 3. - Bilirubin > 6 mg/dL corresponds to a score of 4. Since the bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL, it falls into the range < 2 mg/dL, so the score is 1. 4. Albumin: The albumin level is 3.1 g/dL. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - Albumin > 3.5 g/dL corresponds to a score of 1. - Albumin 2.8-3.5 g/dL corresponds to a score of 2. - Albumin 2.1-2.7 g/dL corresponds to a score of 3. - Albumin < 2.1 g/dL corresponds to a score of 4. Since the albumin is 3.1 g/dL, it falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so the score is 2. 5. INR: The INR value is 1.8. According to the Child-Pugh classification: - INR < 1.7 corresponds to a score of 1. - INR 1.7-2.3 corresponds to a score of 2. - INR 2.4-3.0 corresponds to a score of 3. - INR > 3.0 corresponds to a score of 4. Since the INR is 1.8, it falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so the score is 2. Now, let's sum up the scores for each parameter: - Encephalopathy: 2 - Ascites: 1 - Bilirubin: 1 - Albumin: 2 - INR: 2 Adding these scores together: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the Child-Pugh Score is 8. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh Score, we need to evaluate the following parameters: encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, and INR.

Step 1: Calculate the RR interval in seconds from the heart rate. The heart rate is 81 bpm. The RR interval is the time between successive heartbeats. Since the heart rate is the number of beats per minute, the RR interval in seconds is given by: \[ \text{RR} = \frac{60}{\text{Heart Rate}} = \frac{60}{81} \approx 0.7407 \, \text{seconds}. \] Step 2: Use the Framingham formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc). The Framingham formula is: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{\text{QT}}{\sqrt{\text{RR}}}. \] Given that the QT interval is 330 msec and the RR interval is approximately 0.7407 seconds, we need to calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{\text{RR}} = \sqrt{0.7407} \approx 0.8606. \] Now, plug in the values into the Framingham formula: \[ \text{QTc} = \frac{330}{0.8606} \approx 383.5. \] Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 384 msec. So the corrected QT interval is approximately 384 msec. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula, we follow these steps:\n1.

 Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

Actually criteria: ST depression ≥1mm in ≥2 contiguous leads, or ST elevation ≥1mm in V1-V4, or new LBBB. Here ST depression in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) - that's not contiguous? It's inferior leads, not V1-V4. So maybe 1? But isolated ST elevation in D1-aVL? That's not typical. So maybe 1. Age: 35 <45 => 0. Risk factors: smoking 20 cigarettes/day => 1. Troponin: normal? Not given. Assume normal => 0. Sum: maybe 0+1+0+1+0=2. If history 2, ECG 2, sum 5. Need decide. I'll output 5.

Here is the patient note:
A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for acute chest pain and palpitation at rest with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. He also described an episode of syncope. He was prescribed chlorpheniramine 4 mg a couple of days ago for symptomatic treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, and he was also on propranolol 20 mg treatment for essential tremor and anxiety disorder for many years. He was used to take propranolol daily. His complaints appeared 1 h after intake of the second dosage of chlorpheniramine together with propranolol. He had no prior history of cardiac arrhythmias, valvular or congenital heart disease, and sudden cardiac death in family history. He smoked regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. He denied the usage of legal or illegal other medications such as antidepressants and cocaine. Physical examination revealed irregular pulse, low blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and altered cloudy consciousness. He had no biochemical abnormality; magnesium and potassium level was in normal range. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-segment depression in inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1-aVL []. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions with no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The patient was given 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and underwent emergency coronary angiography that revealed normal coronary arteries. Whenever ischemic changes were observed in admission ECG, anti-ischemic therapy was not admitted to the patient due to the result of completely normal coronaries. After all the patient was followed by telemetry at coronary care unit. Control ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and R on T phenomenon. On the 2nd day of admission, the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) attack which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, immediately patient was defibrillated and sinus rhythm was restored successfully []. After defibrillation, the patient continued to have frequent premature ventricular beats and couplets on the monitor. On the 3rd day of his admission, an upper rib ECG was performed and showed a pattern of right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation in leads V3. The present findings were thought to be compatible with Type 3 Brugada syndrome []. An ajmaline challenge test[] was then performed. Although the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles and couplets was increased during the test, no coved-type ECG pattern appeared in the right precordial leads []. Therefore, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was abandoned. Electrophysiological study was proposed, but the patient refused the test. Because the patient survived a sudden unexplained cardiac arrest, it was decided to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. The patient recovered and had no further complaints after implantation and he was discharged.

Let's break it down step by step. 1. **History**: The patient presented with acute chest pain and palpitation at rest, with a presumed diagnosis of unstable angina. This sounds like a typical presentation for cardiac issues. The HEART score assigns points for the history component as follows: - Typical angina: 2 points - Atypical chest pain: 1 point - Non-anginal chest pain: 0 points Given the description of "acute chest pain and palpitation at rest," it seems to be somewhat typical for cardiac issues, so we can assign this a score of 2. 2. **ECG**: The ECG showed ST-segment depression in the inferior leads and isolated ST elevation in leads D1 and aVL. Let's evaluate the ECG component: - The HEART score assigns points for the ECG component based on the following criteria: - ST depression ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads: 2 points - ST elevation ≥1 mm in leads V1-V4: 2 points - New left bundle branch block (LBBB): 2 points - Non-specific T-wave changes or ST changes: 1 point - Normal ECG: 0 points Here, we have ST-segment depression in the inferior leads (which are contiguous) and isolated ST elevation in leads D1 and aVL. The ST depression in the inferior leads could qualify for the ST depression criterion, and the isolated ST elevation in D1 and aVL is somewhat unusual but might suggest some abnormality. Since the ECG shows both ST depression and isolated ST elevation, it indicates some abnormality. Given the presence of ST changes, we can assign this a score of 2. 3. **Age**: The patient is 35 years old. The HEART score assigns points for age as follows: - <45 years: 0 points - 45-64 years: 1 point - ≥65 years: 2 points Since the patient is 35 years old, the age component scores 0 points. 4. **Risk factors**: The patient has a risk factor: he smokes regularly up to 20 cigarettes a day. The HEART score assigns points for risk factors as follows: - Presence of any risk factor (smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, family history of premature coronary artery disease): 1 point - No risk factors: 0 points Since the patient smokes, he has at least one risk factor. Therefore, the risk factor component scores 1 point. 5. **Troponin**: The note does not mention any information about troponin levels. If the troponin level is normal, the score is 0. If elevated, it would be 1 point. Since it's not mentioned and we assume normal, the troponin component scores 0 points. Now, let's sum up the scores from each component: - History: 2 points - ECG: 2 points - Age: 0 points - Risk factors: 1 point - Troponin: 0 points Adding these together: 2 (History) + 2 (ECG) + 0 (Age) + 1 (Risk factors) + 0 (Troponin) = 5. Therefore, the HEART score is 5.", "answer": "5"}

 Here is the patient note:
A fifteen-year-old girl, born at term of normal delivery second of three siblings, initially presented in the Orthopaedics OPD in 2010 with a history of progressive knee deforming of 1month and was referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation of metabolic bone disease. Dietary history was suggestive of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and adequate sun exposure. No history of malabsorption or renal disorder. On examination, height 150 cm (5–10 percentile), weight 32 <5th percentile, US: LS = 0.96, percentile target height: 161.5 cm, genu valgum deformity noted, intermalleolar distance: 10.9 cm, bilateral wrist widening noted.
Biochemical evaluation revealed serum calcium: 14.2 mg/dl, phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dl, 25(OH) vitamin D: 25.10 nmol/L, iPTH: 1967 pg/ml, alkaline phosphatase: 1400 U/L, 24 hours urinary calcium: 282 mg/24 hours. Imaging: X-ray hand showed features of rickets [Figures -]. CT neck: Features s/o left superior parathyroid adenoma. Lesion in lower pole of left lobe of thyroid Sestamibi scan: S/o functioning parathyroid adenoma on left side. She underwent left inferior parathyroidectomy in May 2010: however, on follow up after 1 year she was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium and was then referred to SGPGI with a diagnosis of persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT).
At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

At evaluation in SGPGI there were no records of previous surgery; repeat methoxy iso butyl isonitrile (MIBI) revealed a superior parathyroid adenoma on left side and was concordant with the ultrasonography (USG) finding of a left superior parathyroid adenoma. Bilateral neck exploration was performed with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. At operation, both right parathyroid glands were found to be grossly normal; a left superior parathyroid adenoma was found which was excised (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm, weight 2.2 gm). However, left inferior parathyroid gland could not be found. IOPTH according to Miami criteria was curative, as there was >50% drop from the pre-excision value of 2130 to 231 at 10 minutes. Histophalogical examination was suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. At the last follow up, in 2016, her biochemical parameters including calcium and iPTH were within normal limits and she was free of bone pains, though her genu valgum persisted.

Answer 8.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Hematologic, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and Neurological. Let's calculate each component step by step. 1. **Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂):** - PaO₂ = 76 mm Hg - FiO₂ = 0.54 - PaO₂/FiO₂ = 76 / 0.54 ≈ 140.74 - According to the SOFA scoring for the respiratory system: - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: 0 points - 300-400: 1 point - 200-300: 2 points - 100-200: 3 points - <100: 4 points - Since 140.74 falls within the range 100-200, the score is 3 points. 2. **Hematologic (Platelets):** - Platelet count = 175,000/µL - According to the SOFA scoring for the hematologic system: - > 150: 0 points - 100-150: 1 point - 50-99: 2 points - <50: 4 points - Since the platelet count is 175,000/µL, which is greater than 150,000/µL, the score is 0 points. 3. **Liver (Bilirubin):** - Bilirubin = 2.3 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the liver system: - < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2-1.9: 1 point - 2-5.9: 2 points - 6-11.9: 3 points - ≥ 12: 4 points - Since the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls within the range 2-5.9, so the score is 2 points. 4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Support):** - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min. - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) = (Systolic BP + 2 * Diastolic BP) / 3 = (120 + 2 * 75) / 3 = (120 + 150) / 3 = 270 / 3 = 90 mm Hg. - To calculate the cardiovascular score, we need to consider both the MAP and the vasopressor support. - If MAP < 70 mm Hg or vasopressors are required to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg, we use the vasopressor dose to determine the score. - The patient is on multiple vasopressors, so we need to determine the equivalent vasopressor score. - NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each. - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min. - DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min (DOBUTamine is not typically counted in the vasopressor score for SOFA unless it's above 20 mcg/kg/min, which it isn't here). Let's convert the vasopressor doses to their respective scores: - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine: - 0-0.1 mcg/kg/min = 1 point - >0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points - Since the patient is on both norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, we can consider the combined effect. However, typically, the total vasopressor score is based on the highest dose or the sum if they exceed certain thresholds. - For simplicity and according to the SOFA scoring rules, if the patient is on more than one vasopressor, the score is based on the highest dose or the combined effect. - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each would each contribute 2 points if used alone. - DOPamine at 5 mcg/kg/min or more = 1 point - DOPamine at >15 mcg/kg/min = 2 points. - Here, DOPamine is at 7 mcg/kg/min, which falls into the range 5-15 mcg/kg/min, so it contributes 1 point. - DOBUTamine is not counted since it's below 20 mcg/kg/min. Now let's sum up the vasopressor support: - NorEPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points - EPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points - DOPamine: 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors simultaneously, we need to determine the total vasopressor support score. Typically, the highest scoring vasopressor is taken, or the combined effect is considered. - NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine both contribute 2 points each. - DOPamine contributes 1 point. The highest scoring vasopressor here is either NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine, both contributing 2 points. Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, we should consider the combined effect. According to the SOFA scoring rules for vasopressors: - If the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine > 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 2 points. - If the patient is on DOPamine > 15 mcg/kg/min, the score is 2 points. - If the patient is on DOPamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min, the score is 1 point. - If the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine 0-0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 1 point. Since the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each and DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, we have: - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points each. - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point. The combined effect can be considered as the highest scoring vasopressor plus any additional support. Since NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine each contribute 2 points and DOPamine contributes 1 point, the total score for vasopressors is the highest score from the vasopressors used. Let's simplify this by considering the highest scoring vasopressor and the additional support: - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points. - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point. Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, the total score is the highest score from the vasopressors plus any additional support if it exceeds the threshold. The total score for the cardiovascular system is the higher of the MAP score and the vasopressor score. - MAP is 90 mm Hg, which is within the range 70-90 mm Hg if we use the vasopressor support. - Since the patient is on vasopressors, we use the vasopressor score. The vasopressor score is: - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points. - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point. Since the patient is on both NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score for each is 2 points. The combined effect can be considered as the highest scoring vasopressor plus any additional support. Let's assume the combined effect is the sum of the highest scoring vasopressor and the additional support: - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine = 2 points each. - DOPamine = 1 point. The total score for the cardiovascular system is the maximum between the MAP score and the vasopressor score. Since the MAP is 90 mm Hg (which is > 70 mm Hg), the MAP score alone would be 0 points if no vasopressors were used. But since vasopressors are used, we use the vasopressor score. The highest scoring vasopressor is NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine, each contributing 2 points. Therefore, the cardiovascular score is 2 points (from NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine). 5. **Renal (Creatinine):** - Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL - According to the SOFA scoring for the renal system: - < 1.2: 0 points - 1.2-1.9: 1 point - 2-3.4: 2 points - 3.5-4.9: 3 points - ≥ 5: 4 points - Since the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls within the range 1.2-1.9, so the score is 1 point. 6. **Neurological (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)):** - GCS = 10 - According to the SOFA scoring for the neurological system: - 15: 0 points - 13-14: 1 point - 10-12: 2 points - 6-9: 3 points - < 6: 4 points - Since the GCS is 10, it falls within the range 10-12, so the score is 2 points. Now, let's sum up all the scores from each system: - Respiratory: 3 points - Hematologic: 0 points - Liver: 2 points - Cardiovascular: 2 points - Renal: 1 point - Neurological: 2 points Total SOFA score = 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10 points. So the total SOFA score is 10. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the SOFA score, we need to evaluate the patient across six different organ systems: Respiratory, Hematologic, Liver, Cardiovascular, Renal, and Neurological. Let's calculate each component step by step.\n\n1. **Respiratory (PaO₂/FiO₂):**\n - PaO₂ = 76 mm Hg\n - FiO₂ = 0.54\n - PaO₂/FiO₂ = 76 / 0.54 ≈ 140.74\n - According to the SOFA scoring for the respiratory system:\n - PaO₂/FiO₂ > 400: 0 points\n - 300-400: 1 point\n - 200-300: 2 points\n - 100-200: 3 points\n - <100: 4 points\n - Since 140.74 falls within the range 100-200, the score is 3 points.\n\n2. **Hematologic (Platelets):**\n - Platelet count = 175,000/µL\n - According to the SOFA scoring for the hematologic system:\n - > 150: 0 points\n - 100-150: 1 point\n - 50-99: 2 points\n - <50: 4 points\n - Since the platelet count is 175,000/µL, which is greater than 150,000/µL, the score is 0 points.\n\n3. **Liver (Bilirubin):**\n - Bilirubin = 2.3 mg/dL\n - According to the SOFA scoring for the liver system:\n - < 1.2: 0 points\n - 1.2-1.9: 1 point\n - 2-5.9: 2 points\n - 6-11.9: 3 points\n - ≥ 12: 4 points\n - Since the bilirubin level is 2.3 mg/dL, it falls within the range 2-5.9, so the score is 2 points.\n\n4. **Cardiovascular (MAP and Vasopressor Support):**\n - The patient is on multiple vasopressors: norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min.\n - Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) = (Systolic BP + 2 * Diastolic BP) / 3 = (120 + 2 * 75) / 3 = (120 + 150) / 3 = 270 / 3 = 90 mm Hg.\n - To calculate the cardiovascular score, we need to consider both the MAP and the vasopressor support.\n - If MAP < 70 mm Hg or vasopressors are required to maintain MAP ≥ 70 mm Hg, we use the vasopressor dose to determine the score.\n - The patient is on multiple vasopressors, so we need to determine the equivalent vasopressor score.\n - NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each.\n - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min.\n - DOBUTamine at 1 mcg/kg/min (DOBUTamine is not typically counted in the vasopressor score for SOFA unless it's above 20 mcg/kg/min, which it isn't here).\n\n Let's convert the vasopressor doses to their respective scores:\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine: \n - 0-0.1 mcg/kg/min = 1 point\n - >0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points\n - Since the patient is on both norEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each, we can consider the combined effect. However, typically, the total vasopressor score is based on the highest dose or the sum if they exceed certain thresholds.\n - For simplicity and according to the SOFA scoring rules, if the patient is on more than one vasopressor, the score is based on the highest dose or the combined effect.\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each would each contribute 2 points if used alone.\n - DOPamine at 5 mcg/kg/min or more = 1 point\n - DOPamine at >15 mcg/kg/min = 2 points.\n - Here, DOPamine is at 7 mcg/kg/min, which falls into the range 5-15 mcg/kg/min, so it contributes 1 point.\n - DOBUTamine is not counted since it's below 20 mcg/kg/min.\n\n Now let's sum up the vasopressor support:\n - NorEPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points\n - EPINEPHrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points\n - DOPamine: 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point\n\n Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors simultaneously, we need to determine the total vasopressor support score. Typically, the highest scoring vasopressor is taken, or the combined effect is considered.\n\n - NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine both contribute 2 points each.\n - DOPamine contributes 1 point.\n\n The highest scoring vasopressor here is either NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine, both contributing 2 points. Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, we should consider the combined effect.\n\n According to the SOFA scoring rules for vasopressors:\n - If the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine > 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 2 points.\n - If the patient is on DOPamine > 15 mcg/kg/min, the score is 2 points.\n - If the patient is on DOPamine 5-15 mcg/kg/min, the score is 1 point.\n - If the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine 0-0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score is 1 point.\n\n Since the patient is on NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min each and DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, we have:\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points each.\n - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point.\n\n The combined effect can be considered as the highest scoring vasopressor plus any additional support. Since NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine each contribute 2 points and DOPamine contributes 1 point, the total score for vasopressors is the highest score from the vasopressors used.\n\n Let's simplify this by considering the highest scoring vasopressor and the additional support:\n\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points.\n - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point.\n\n Since the patient is on multiple vasopressors, the total score is the highest score from the vasopressors plus any additional support if it exceeds the threshold.\n\n The total score for the cardiovascular system is the higher of the MAP score and the vasopressor score.\n\n - MAP is 90 mm Hg, which is within the range 70-90 mm Hg if we use the vasopressor support.\n - Since the patient is on vasopressors, we use the vasopressor score.\n\n The vasopressor score is:\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min = 2 points.\n - DOPamine at 7 mcg/kg/min = 1 point.\n\n Since the patient is on both NorEPINEPHrine and EPINEPHrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, the score for each is 2 points. The combined effect can be considered as the highest scoring vasopressor plus any additional support.\n\n Let's assume the combined effect is the sum of the highest scoring vasopressor and the additional support:\n\n - NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine = 2 points each.\n - DOPamine = 1 point.\n\n The total score for the cardiovascular system is the maximum between the MAP score and the vasopressor score.\n\n Since the MAP is 90 mm Hg (which is > 70 mm Hg), the MAP score alone would be 0 points if no vasopressors were used. But since vasopressors are used, we use the vasopressor score.\n\n The highest scoring vasopressor is NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine, each contributing 2 points.\n\n Therefore, the cardiovascular score is 2 points (from NorEPINEPHrine or EPINEPHrine).\n\n5. **Renal (Creatinine):**\n - Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL\n - According to the SOFA scoring for the renal system:\n - < 1.2: 0 points\n - 1.2-1.9: 1 point\n - 2-3.4: 2 points\n - 3.5-4.9: 3 points\n - ≥ 5: 4 points\n - Since the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, it falls within the range 1.2-1.9, so the score

 Here is the patient note:
The subject was a 14-year-old female patient with EDS hypermobile type. She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().
EDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.
The AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.
In the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.
The intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.

 Here is the patient note:
A 172-cm tall, 18-year-old man, weight 100 kg, was admitted to our department in January 2020 due to left medial deep ankle pain after stamping the clutch about 10 days ago, who had an extreme liking of seafood, beer and carbonated drinks. During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.

The given weight is 100 kg and the height is 172 cm. Let's plug these values into the formula step by step. Step 1: Calculate weight(kg)^0.425. weight = 100 kg weight^0.425 = 100^0.425 Using logarithms for easier calculation: ln(100) ≈ 4.60517 Now multiply this by 0.425: 4.60517 * 0.425 ≈ 1.9574 Now take the exponential of this result to get back to the original base: exp(1.9574) ≈ 7.07 So, 100^0.425 ≈ 7.07. Step 2: Calculate height(cm)^0.725. height = 172 cm height^0.725 = 172^0.725 Using logarithms for this calculation: ln(172) ≈ 5.1478 Now multiply this by 0.725: 5.1478 * 0.725 ≈ 3.735 Now take the exponential of this result: exp(3.735) ≈ 41.8 So, 172^0.725 ≈ 41.8.

BSA = 0.007184 * (100^0.425) * (172^0.725) ≈ 0.007184 * 7.07 * 41.8 First, multiply 7.07 * 41.8: 7.07 * 41.8 ≈ 296.026 Now multiply this result by 0.007184: 0.007184 * 296.026 ≈ 2.12 Therefore, the BSA is approximately 2.12 m².", "answer": "1.9"} It seems I made an error in the final calculation. Let's redo the last part more carefully.

Let's use a calculator for a more precise calculation. Using the formula directly with the given values: \[ \text{BSA} = 0.007184 \times (100)^{0.425} \times (172)^{0.725} \] Using a calculator: \[ 100^{0.425} \approx 7.071 \] \[ 172^{0.725} \approx 41.79 \] Now multiply these results: \[ 7.071 \times 41.79 \approx 296.0 \] Then multiply by 0.007184: \[ 0.007184 \times 296.0 \approx 2.13 \] Thus the BSA is approximately 2.13 m².

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 µmol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome.

 Here is the patient note:
A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.
Biopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.
The patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina. The patient is able to resume a normal life without limitations.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well.

This falls into the range of 2-3 mg/dL, so it gets 3 points. 2. **Albumin (g/dL):** - >3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.7: 3 points - <2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 2.8 g/dL. This falls into the range of 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points. 3. **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.9. This falls into the range of 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points The patient has moderate ascites. This corresponds to "Moderate to Severe," so it gets 3 points. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 1 point - Grade 2: 2 points - Grade 3: 3 points - Grade 4: 4 points The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Since grade 1 and grade 2 both get 1 and 2 points respectively, and the note says "grade 1-2," we'll take the higher value within this range for the worst-case scenario within the given range. Grade 1 gets 1 point, and Grade 2 gets 2 points. Let's assume the patient has Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy for the lower score, which is 1 point. If it's Grade 2, it would be 2 points. Let's calculate both scenarios: Scenario 1: If the patient has Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy. - Encephalopathy: 1 point Scenario 2: If the patient has Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy. - Encephalopathy: 2 points Now, let's calculate the total score for both scenarios. For Scenario 1 (Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy): - Total Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 1 point Total Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11 points. For Scenario 2 (Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy): - Total Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12 points. It seems there was a mistake in the initial thinking. Let's correct the parameters and their corresponding points based on the given information. Given: - Encephalopathy: Grade 1-2 (we'll take the higher value for the worst-case scenario, which is Grade 2, so 2 points). - Ascites: Moderate (2 points for moderate ascites). - Bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dL (This falls into the range 2-3 mg/dL, so it gets 3 points). - Albumin: 2.8 g/dL (This falls into the range 2.8-3.5 g/dL, so it gets 2 points). - INR: 1.9 (This falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points). Now let's sum up the points: - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. - Ascites (moderate): 2 points. - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points. - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points. - INR (1.9): 2 points. Total Child-Pugh Score = 2 (Encephalopathy) + 2 (Ascites) + 3 (Bilirubin) + 2 (Albumin) + 2 (INR) = 11 points. Now, let's classify the Child-Pugh score: - Child-Pugh Class A: 5-6 points - Child-Pugh Class B: 7-9 points - Child-Pugh Class C: 10-15 points Since the total score is 11 points, it falls into Child-Pugh Class C. But let's recheck the ascites classification. Moderate ascites is classified as 2 points. So the correct points are: - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. - Ascites (moderate): 2 points. - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points. - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points. - INR (1.9): 2 points. Total = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11. It seems I made an error in the ascites classification. Moderate ascites is actually classified as 2 points. Let's try another approach by using the correct ranges and classifications. 1. **Total Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - <1.0: 1 point - 1.0-1.9: 2 points - 2.0-5.9: 3 points - >5.9: 4 points The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. This falls into the range 2.0-5.9, so it gets 3 points. 2. **Albumin (g/dL):** - >3.5: 1 point - 2.8-3.5: 2 points - 2.1-2.7: 3 points - <2.1: 4 points The patient's albumin is 2.8 g/dL. This falls into the range 2.8-3.5, so it gets 2 points. 3. **INR (Prothrombin Time):** - <1.7: 1 point - 1.7-2.3: 2 points - 2.4-3.0: 3 points - >3.0: 4 points The patient's INR is 1.9. This falls into the range 1.7-2.3, so it gets 2 points. 4. **Ascites:** - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points The patient has moderate ascites. This corresponds to "Moderate to Severe," so it gets 3 points. 5. **Encephalopathy:** - None: 1 point - Grade 1: 1 point - Grade 2: 2 points - Grade 3: 3 points - Grade 4: 4 points The patient has grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Let's take the higher value within this range, which is Grade 2, so it gets 2 points. Now, let's sum up the points: - Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 3 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 12, which corresponds to Child-Pugh Class C. It seems I made an error in the ascites classification. Let's correct it. The correct classification for ascites is: - None: 1 point - Mild: 2 points - Moderate to Severe: 3 points Since the patient has moderate ascites, it should be classified as "Moderate to Severe," which is 3 points. So the correct points are: - Bilirubin (2.5 mg/dL): 3 points - Albumin (2.8 g/dL): 2 points - INR (1.9): 2 points - Ascites (moderate): 2 points (since moderate is considered mild to moderate in some classifications, but let's use the given information that moderate is 2 points). - Encephalopathy (Grade 1-2, taking the higher value, Grade 2): 2 points. Let's sum up the points with the correct ascites classification (moderate = 2 points): - Bilirubin: 3 points - Albumin: 2 points - INR: 2 points - Ascites: 2 points - Encephalopathy: 2 points Total Child-Pugh Score = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11 points. So the Child-Pugh score is 11, which corresponds to Child-Pugh Class C. Thus the final score is 11. Assistant {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Child-Pugh score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following parameters and assign points to each parameter: 1. **Total Bilirubin (mg/dL):** - <1.0: 1 point - 1.0-1.9: 2 points - 2.0-5.9: 3 points - >5.9: 4 points The patient's total bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL.

So answer: 12-16% 10-year risk. Provide as percentage.</think> However, the Framingham Risk Score calculation involves specific tables and formulas. Let's calculate it step by step using the Framingham Risk Score formula for women. The Framingham Risk Score for women includes the following factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and smoking status. The formula for the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) for women is: \[ P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-Z}} \] where \[ Z = -6.803 + a_1 \times \text{(age)} + a_2 \times \text{(ln(Total Cholesterol))} + a_3 \times \text{(ln(HDL))} + a_4 \times \text{(ln(SBP))} + a_5 \times \text{(Smoking Status)} + a_6 \times \text{(Diabetes Status)} \] The coefficients for the variables are as follows: - For age: - $a_1 = 0.111 \times \text{(age)}$ - For total cholesterol (mg/dL): - $a_2 = 0.154 \times \ln(\text{Total Cholesterol})$ - For HDL cholesterol (mg/dL): - $a_3 = -0.120 \times \ln(\text{HDL})$ - For systolic blood pressure (mm Hg): - If the patient is on blood pressure medication, $a_4 = 0.179 \times \ln(\text{SBP}) + 0.47 \times 1$ (since she is on medication) - If the patient is not on blood pressure medication, $a_4 = 0.179 \times \ln(\text{SBP})$ - For smoking status: - $a_5 = 0.564$ if the patient smokes - $a_5 = 0$ if the patient does not smoke - For diabetes status: - $a_6 = 0.992$ if the patient has diabetes - $a_6 = 0$ if the patient does not have diabetes Let's plug in the values for this patient: - Age = 67 years - Total Cholesterol = 196 mg/dL - HDL = 50 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) = 140 mm Hg - The patient is on blood pressure medication (lisinopril and metoprolol), so treated for hypertension. - The patient does not smoke. - The patient does not have diabetes (not mentioned and no indication). Now, let's calculate each term step by step. 1. Calculate $\ln(\text{Total Cholesterol})$: \[ \ln(196) \approx 5.278 \] 2. Calculate $\ln(\text{HDL})$: \[ \ln(50) \approx 3.912 \] 3. Calculate $\ln(\text{SBP})$: \[ \ln(140) \approx 4.942 \] Now, we can plug these into the formula for $Z$. \[ Z = -6.803 + a_1 \times \text{(age)} + a_2 \times \ln(\text{Total Cholesterol}) + a_3 \times \ln(\text{HDL}) + a_4 \times \ln(\text{SBP}) + a_5 \times \text{(Smoking Status)} + a_6 \times \text{(Diabetes Status)} \] Using the coefficients: - $a_1 = 0.111 \times \text{(age)} = 0.111 \times 67 = 7.437$ - $a_2 = 0.154 \times \ln(\text{Total Cholesterol}) = 0.154 \times 5.278 \approx 0.811$ - $a_3 = -0.120 \times \ln(\text{HDL}) = -0.120 \times 3.912 \approx -0.469$ - Since the patient is on blood pressure medication, $a_4 = 0.179 \times \ln(\text{SBP}) + 0.47 = 0.179 \times 4.942 + 0.47 \approx 0.886 + 0.47 = 1.356$ - $a_5 = 0$ because the patient does not smoke. - $a_6 = 0$ because the patient does not have diabetes. Now, let's sum up all the terms for $Z$: \[ Z = -6.803 + 7.437 + 0.811 - 0.469 + 1.356 + 0 + 0 \] Let's add them step by step: \[ -6.803 + 7.437 = 0.634 \] \[ 0.634 + 0.811 = 1.445 \] \[ 1.445 - 0.469 = 0.976 \] \[ 0.976 + 1.356 = 2.332 \] So, $Z \approx 2.332$. Now, we use the formula for the probability $P$: \[ P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-Z}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2.332}} \] Calculate $e^{-2.332}$: \[ e^{-2.332} \approx 0.096 \] Now, plug this into the formula for $P$: \[ P = \frac{1}{1 + 0.096} \approx \frac{1}{1.096} \approx 0.912 \] To convert this to a percentage: \[ P \approx 0.912 \times 100 \approx 9.12\% \] So the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease for this patient is approximately 9.12%. Thus, the Framingham Risk Score corresponds to a 10-year risk of approximately 9%. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we use the Framingham Risk Score formula for women.

The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 196.0 mg. To convert 196.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 196.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.196 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.196 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000507 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000507 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000507 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.507 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.507 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 196.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.07 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 50.0 mg. To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 95%|█████████▌| 95/100 [1:24:51<07:34, 90.90s/it]

The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation or those who require anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score includes the following components: - H: Hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg) - A: Abnormal renal/liver function - S: Stroke history - B: Bleeding history or predisposition - L: Labile INR (if on warfarin) - E: Elderly (age > 65 years) - D: Drugs/alcohol (concomitant use of drugs or alcohol) Let's evaluate each component for the given patient: 1. **H: Hypertension** - The patient has hypertension, and the recent BP measurement is 164/113 mmHg. Since the systolic BP is >160 mmHg and the diastolic BP is >100 mmHg, this criterion is met. Score = 1. 2. **A: Abnormal renal/liver function** - The note states that there are no predominant signs of renal impairment, as witnessed by normal creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate. No information about liver function is provided, but since it is not mentioned as abnormal, we will assume it is normal. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 3. **S: Stroke history** - The patient has a history of stroke. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 4. **B: Bleeding history or predisposition** - The patient's history does not note any significant bleeding episodes, suggesting no predisposition to bleeding. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 5. **L: Labile INR (if on warfarin)** - The note mentions that the coagulation profiles including INR have consistently been within the normal range without noteworthy fluctuations. Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. 6. **E: Elderly (age > 65 years)** - The patient is 70 years old, which is > 65 years. This criterion is met. Score = 1. 7. **D: Drugs/alcohol** - The patient denies alcohol consumption, reporting zero drinks per week. There is no mention of concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk (like NSAIDs). Therefore, this criterion is not met. Score = 0. Now, let's add up the scores for each criterion: - H (Hypertension): 1 - A (Abnormal renal/liver function): 0 - S (Stroke history): 1 - B (Bleeding history or predisposition): 0 - L (Labile INR): 0 - E (Elderly): 1 - D (Drugs/alcohol): 0 Total HAS-BLED score = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3.

 Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20–50 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.
The patient’s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 × 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.
Six months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.

Actually correction: add 2.5 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin from normal 4.0. Albumin values given: 1.2 g/dL at presentation, later 2.5 g/dL, 1.9 g/dL, 2.2 g/dL. Which albumin to use? Probably current albumin? The question: "patient's albumin corrected delta gap" maybe at current? Use latest albumin 2.2 g/dL. Compute delta gap: HCO3 18 mEq/L. Na 135, K 5.5, Cl 110. Na+K-Cl = 135+5.5-110=30.5. Delta gap = 18-30.5 = -12.5. Albumin correction: albumin 2.2 g/dL, normal 4.0, difference 1.8 g/dL. Correction = 2.5*1.8=4.5 mEq/L. Add to delta gap: -12.5+4.5 = -8.0 mEq/L. So answer -8.0 mEq/L.

Here is the patient note:
A now four-year-old boy presented at the age of 3 years to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever (39.5 °C), vomiting, and watery stools, which had already improved. He also had lower limb oedema and periorbital puffiness for one week. Apart from receiving paracetamol for the fever, there was no history of medication use. He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.
On initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 µmol/L; normal 2.6–52.2 µmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8–6.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5–14.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 × 109/L; normal 4–12 × 109/L), platelet count (23 × 109/L; normal 150–400 × 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5–2.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150–500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80–1.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16–0.48 g/L).

So answer -8.0 mEq/L.</think> But wait, the question seems to be asking for the albumin-corrected delta gap at the time of the initial presentation since it's the first set of lab values given. Let's calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap for the initial presentation: Initial values: - Serum bicarbonate (HCO3): 18 mmol/L - Sodium (Na): 135 mmol/L - Potassium (K): 5.5 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl): 110 mmol/L - Albumin: 1.2 g/dL First, calculate the anion gap (AG): \[ \text{Anion gap} = \text{Na} - (\text{Cl} + \text{HCO3}) \] \[ \text{Anion gap} = 135 - (110 + 18) = 135 - 128 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, calculate the delta gap: \[ \text{Delta gap} = \text{HCO3} - (\text{Na} + \text{K} - \text{Cl}) \] Calculate \( \text{Na} + \text{K} - \text{Cl} \): \[ \text{Na} + \text{K} - \text{Cl} = 135 + 5.5 - 110 = 30.5 \] So, \[ \text{Delta gap} = 18 - 30.5 = -12.5 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, we need to correct this delta gap for the albumin level. The formula to correct the delta gap for albumin is to add 2.5 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin from the normal level of 4 g/dL. The patient's albumin is 1.2 g/dL. The decrease from the normal level is: \[ 4.0 - 1.2 = 2.8 \, \text{g/dL} \] The correction for albumin is: \[ 2.5 \times 2.8 = 7.0 \, \text{mEq/L} \] Now, add this correction to the delta gap: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected delta gap} = -12.5 + 7.0 = -5.5 \, \text{mEq/L} \] So the albumin-corrected delta gap at the time of the initial presentation is -5.5 mEq/L. Thus the answer is -5.5 mEq/L. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap, we need the following steps:\n1.

A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 × 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient’s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 − 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 × 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient’s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.', 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Model': 'openai/gpt-oss-20b', 'LLM Answer': "name 'N' is not defined", 'LLM Raw Thinking': 'We need albumin corrected delta gap. Delta gap = serum bicarbonate - (Na + K - Cl). Corrected for albumin: add 2.5 mEq per g/dL decrease? Actually correction: add 2.5 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin from normal 4.0. Albumin values given: 1.2 g/dL at presentation, later 2.5 g/dL, 1.9 g/dL, 2.2 g/dL. Which albumin to use? Probably current albumin? The question: "patient\'s albumin corrected delta gap" maybe at current? Use latest albumin 2.2 g/dL. Compute delta gap: HCO3 18 mEq/L. Na 135, K 5.5, Cl 110. Na+K-Cl = 135+5.5-110=30.5. Delta gap = 18-30.5 = -12.5. Albumin correction: albumin 2.2 g/dL, normal 4.0, difference 1.8 g/dL. Correction = 2.5*1.8=4.5 mEq/L. Add to delta gap: -12.5+4.5 = -8.0 mEq/L.

Identify the initial lab values: HCO3 = 18 mEq/L, Na = 135 mEq/L, K = 5.5 mEq/L, Cl = 110 mEq/L, and Albumin = 1.2 g/dL.\\n2. Calculate the delta gap using the formula: Delta gap = HCO3 - (Na + K - Cl).\\n3. Calculate Na + K - Cl: 135 + 5.5 - 110 = 30.5.\\n4. Therefore, the Delta gap = 18 - 30.5 = -12.5 mEq/L.\\n5. Correct this delta gap for the albumin level. The formula to correct the delta gap for albumin is to add 2.5 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL decrease in albumin from the normal level of 4 g/dL.\\n6.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 135.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 7.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 1.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 7.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.2 (in g/dL)) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect', 'Target Result': 'Incorrect'} 97%|█████████▋| 97/100 [1:26:16<03:19, 66.34s/it]

THOUGHTS IN GENERAL We need to compute conception date. Last menstrual period (LMP) 08/22/2014. Cycle length 27 days. Ovulation occurs about 14 days before next period? Actually typical: ovulation occurs 14 days before next period. For cycle length 27, ovulation day = LMP + (cycle length - 14) = 27-14=13 days after LMP. So conception likely around ovulation day. So conception date = LMP + 13 days = 08/22/2014 + 13 days = 09/04/2014? Let's add: 22+13=35, so 35-30=5? Wait month August has 31 days. 22+13=35. 35-31=4. So 09/04/2014. So answer 09/04/2014.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) in April 2021 for altered mental status. His medical history consisted of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and there was no history of malignancy. Per Emergency Medical Services, the patient lives at home with a roommate who witnessed a seizure-like episode. He arrived at the ED with glucose in the 700s. Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.
Approximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath. Vital signs at the time of admission: temperature 37.9° Celsius, heart rate 92 beats/minute, blood pressure 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation was clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Bilateral 2+ pitting edema was present to the level of his knees. Initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml (reference <0.012 ng/ml) but subsequently downtrended to <0.02 ng/ml, and pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) was 2800 pg/ml (reference 0-300 pg/ml). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads; there were no diffuse ST-segment elevations (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe global hypokinesis, increased wall thickness of the right ventricle, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. Unfortunately, the patient again left against medical advice.
Three months later, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to be volume overloaded due to medication noncompliance. TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right atrium, consistent with cardiac tamponade physiology. He underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 800 ml serosanguinous fluid that was negative for malignant cytology. Acid-fast bacilli culture and smear of the pericardial fluid were negative. Approximately one month later, the patient saw his cardiologist for follow-up. The patient was referred to the ED for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. On this most recent ED visit, approximately four months after the initial presentation, the patient agreed to stay in the hospital and undergo a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
In addition to evaluation of his cellulitis, bedside ultrasonography showed that a moderate to large pericardial effusion had recurred, though without evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse or right atrial systolic collapse. CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigens (CA 19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were negative. Repeat TTE showed large pericardial effusion (2.3 cm) and evidence of tamponade physiology (exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocity (E) on Doppler echocardiography).
Of note, a previous left heart catheterization with coronary angiography did not show significant obstructive coronary artery disease. A prior echocardiogram seven months prior revealed an ejection fraction of 65%, without pericardial effusion. The patient underwent placement of a pericardial window, and a chest tube was inserted. Repeat blood cultures were negative. The chest tube drained approximately 165 ml. The patient’s clinical presentation improved, and he was discharged home.

Pleuritic chest pain is typically sharp and worsens with deep breaths or coughing, which is not typical for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, this would be considered an atypical presentation for ACS. The scoring for history is as follows:\n- Typical chest pain: 2 points\n- Atypical chest pain: 1 point\n- No chest pain: 0 points\nSince the chest pain is described as pleuritic, it is atypical for ACS. So, the score for History is 1 point.\n\n2. **ECG**: The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltages in the limb leads and no diffuse ST-segment elevations. Low voltage can be due to various reasons such as obesity, pericardial effusion, or other conditions, but it does not indicate ischemic changes. Since there are no ST changes suggestive of ischemia, the ECG score is 0 points.\n\n3. **Age**: The patient is 47 years old. The scoring for age is as follows:\n- <55 years: 0 points\n- ≥55 years: 1 point\nSince the patient is 47 years old, the score for Age is 0 points.\n\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The risk factors for ACS include diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and previous history of coronary artery disease. The scoring for risk factors is as follows:\n- 0 risk factors: 0 points\n- 1-2 risk factors: 1 point\n- ≥3 risk factors: 2 points\nThe patient has two risk factors (diabetes and hypertension), so the score for Risk factors is 1 point.\n\n5. **Troponin**: The initial troponin was 0.481 ng/ml, which is elevated above the reference range (<0.012 ng/ml). The scoring for troponin is as follows:\n- Normal: 0 points\n- Elevated: 2 points\nSince the troponin is elevated, the score for Troponin is 2 points.\n\nNow, let's add up all the scores:\n- History: 1 point\n- ECG: 0 points\n- Age: 0 points\n- Risk factors: 1 point\n- Troponin: 2 points\n\nTotal HEART score = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the patient's HEART score is 4.", "answer": "4"}
