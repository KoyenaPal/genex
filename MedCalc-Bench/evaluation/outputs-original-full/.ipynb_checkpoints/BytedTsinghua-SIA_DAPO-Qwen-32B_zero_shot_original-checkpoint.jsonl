{"Row Number": 1, "Calculator Name": "Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", "Calculator ID": "2", "Category": "lab", "Note ID": "pmc-7671985-1", "Patient Note": "An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction. Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 \u00b0C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 \u00d7 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a\u2013c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of \u201cacute type\u201d ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f). The causes of death were thus determined as (1) DIC and (2) ALF associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", "LLM Name": "BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Qwen-32B", "LLM Answer": "25", "LLM Explanation": "Step 1: Calculate the patient's BMI to determine if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The patient's height is 163 cm and weight is 48 kg. The formula for BMI is: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2. Convert the height to meters: 163 cm = 1.63 m. Now calculate the BMI: BMI = 48 / (1.63)^2 = 48 / 2.6569 \u2248 18.07. Since the BMI is 18.07, which is below 18.5, the patient is considered underweight. Step 2: Determine the adjusted body weight. Since the patient is underweight, the adjusted body weight is set to the patient's actual body weight, which is 48 kg. Step 3: Use the Cockroft-Gault equation to calculate the creatinine clearance. The Cockroft-Gault equation is: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [(140 - age) * weight (kg) * (1 if male / 0.85 if female)] / (72 * serum creatinine (mg/dL)). For this patient: - Age = 87 years - Weight = 48 kg (adjusted body weight) - Serum creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL - The patient is male. Plugging these values into the Cockroft-Gault equation: Creatinine Clearance = [(140 - 87) * 48 * 1] / (72 * 1.4). Now calculate step by step: 1. Calculate (140 - 87): 140 - 87 = 53 2. Multiply the result by the weight (48 kg): 53 * 48 = 2544 3. The numerator is thus 2544. 4. Calculate the denominator: 72 * 1.4 = 100.8 5. Now divide the numerator by the denominator: 2544 / 100.8 \u2248 25.24 So the estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation is approximately 25.24 mL/min.", "LLM Thinking": "Step-by-step thinking process to solve the question: Step 1: Calculate the patient's BMI to determine if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

", "Ground Truth Answer": "25.238", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 87 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 163.0 cm, which is 163.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.63 m. The patient's weight is 48.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 48.0 kg / (1.63 m * 1.63 m) = 18.066 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.1, indicating they are underweight.\nBecause the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 48.0 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. \nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 87) * 48.0 * 1) / (1.4 * 72) = 25.238 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 25.238 mL/min.", "Result": "Correct"}
